<b>Sure, let's hear it.</b>

<b>And all your friends will be taken
to my new lab, which will be built soon.</b>

85
00:08:52,353 --> 00:08:55,189
<b>We'll cut them up, grind them,</b>

86
00:08:55,773 --> 00:08:56,816
<b>and pull out their organs.</b>

87
00:08:58,109 --> 00:09:01,654
<b>We'll prick and rip their flesh to shreds.</b>

88
00:09:01,738 --> 00:09:04,866
<b>So predictable. It's not even touching.</b>

89
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:06,659
<b>The movie will be an epic fail.</b>

90
00:09:06,743 --> 00:09:09,329
<b>Frankly, we have nothing to lose. Why?</b>

91
00:09:09,412 --> 00:09:11,372
<b>Because we've always done those things.</b>

92
00:09:11,956 --> 00:09:14,334
<b>We just did what we always do.</b>

93
00:09:14,417 --> 00:09:17,962
<b>Then who do you think
will be the target of criticism?</b>

94
00:09:19,631 --> 00:09:22,175
<b>Those who failed to protect
what they had to protect.</b>

95
00:09:22,842 --> 00:09:26,471
<i><b>The incompetent, pathetic,</i></b>

<i><b>responsibility-dodging pathological liars.</i></b>

97

<b>The country that embarrasses its citizens.</b>

98
00:09:31,893 --> 00:09:33,728
<b>The country where you people live.</b>

99
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:37,440
<b>Even those who you risked your life for

100

<b>You see, you're just being used.</b>

102

<b>You're nothing but a scapegoat.</b>

103

<b>Stop spewing complete nonsense

106
00:10:00,963 --> 00:10:03,466
<b>Or shall I go up?</b>

107
00:10:04,175 --> 00:10:05,677
<b>I guarantee you.</b>

108
00:10:06,427 --> 00:10:08,388
<b>You guys will never catch me.</b>

109
00:10:08,805 --> 00:10:10,682
<b>The ones who are worse than me</b>

110

00:10:18,106 --> 00:10:19,816
<b>He actually went alone?</b>

112
00:10:22,026 --> 00:10:23,736
<b>I want to yell at him when he does this.</b>

113
00:10:24,237 --> 00:10:25,405
<b>Then we should go too.</b>

114
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,115
<b>Right, Tae-woong?</b>

115
00:10:39,794 --> 00:10:41,462
<i><b>All the tragedies</i></b>

116

<i><b>will be reenacted by Argos in person.</i></b>

118
00:10:55,518 --> 00:10:57,061
<i><b>On the other hand, I'm just sorry.</i></b>

119
00:10:58,229 --> 00:10:59,772
<b>I'm sorry about everything</b>

120
00:11:01,941 --> 00:11:03,693
<b>and that guilt is hard to bear.</b>

121
00:11:12,577 --> 00:11:16,372
<b>So you're saying the video
of Hwang Deuk-gu is like a decoy?</b>

122
00:11:16,456 --> 00:11:20,960
<b>Unlike the video of Director Gu, it was
only disseminated to the police intranet.</b>

123
00:11:21,836 --> 00:11:23,296
<b>It's fishy, I must say.</b>

124
00:11:25,214 --> 00:11:26,674
<b>They act all righteous,</b>

125
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:29,469
<b>but they threaten the police
behind the closed curtains.</b>

126
00:11:29,886 --> 00:11:32,889
<b>The trap they set up for Gi-beom
can't be the only thing they're after.</b>

127
00:11:33,723 --> 00:11:34,849
<b>That's what we must stop.</b>

128
00:11:36,225 --> 00:11:38,770
<b>Did you stay up all night
pondering whether you should go alone?</b>

129
00:11:40,855 --> 00:11:43,232
<b>I'm Hwang Deuk-gu's target, you know.</b>

130
00:11:44,525 --> 00:11:45,401
<b>Right, so far.</b>

131
00:11:46,068 --> 00:11:48,613
<b>Earlier, I couldn't cry
even though I was so sad.</b>

132
00:11:49,614 --> 00:11:52,867
<b>It made me wonder,
"Am I really sad or not?"</b>

133
00:11:53,451 --> 00:11:54,452
<b>Right.</b>

134
00:11:55,828 --> 00:11:59,290
<b>I can't remember the last time I broke out
in a sweat with cold, clammy hands.</b>

135
00:12:02,293 --> 00:12:04,003
<b>No matter what I decide to do,</b>

136
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:06,714
<b>I'm sure you'd do the same
if you were in my position.</b>

137
00:12:07,924 --> 00:12:09,175
<b>But it's different.</b>

138
00:12:09,967 --> 00:12:11,135
<b>You're making a sacrifice,</b>

139
00:12:11,886 --> 00:12:14,806
<b>whereas I'd just be paying
for my past deeds.</b>

140
00:12:14,889 --> 00:12:16,766
<b>The outcome would be the same though.</b>

141
00:12:17,266 --> 00:12:19,018
<b>Because I will stop you.</b>

142
00:12:19,685 --> 00:12:20,686
<b>So?</b>

143
00:12:21,562 --> 00:12:22,814
<b>You'll actually go there alone?</b>

144
00:12:24,774 --> 00:12:28,611
<b>If Hwang Deuk-gu is still after Rugal
even after I step in,</b>

145
00:12:29,278 --> 00:12:30,863
<b>then you'll have to stop him.</b>

146
00:12:31,447 --> 00:12:35,284
<b>Each of us has our own tasks, that's all.</b>

147
00:12:36,494 --> 00:12:37,537
<b>Right.</b>

148
00:12:38,496 --> 00:12:39,497
<b>We all have</b>

149
00:12:40,581 --> 00:12:41,958
<b>our own tasks.</b>

150
00:12:55,847 --> 00:12:56,931
<b>Good luck.</b>

151
00:12:58,349 --> 00:12:59,183
<b>Thanks.</b>

152
00:13:02,186 --> 00:13:03,396
<b>Don't be afraid.</b>

153
00:13:03,479 --> 00:13:06,232
<b>Come on. Your arm can kill people.</b>

<b>It's not over until it's over.</b>

156
00:13:28,296 --> 00:13:30,673
<b>The video of Hwang Deuk-gu
that was on the news last night</b>

157
00:13:30,756 --> 00:13:33,050
<b>wasn't revealed to the public.</b>

158
00:13:33,134 --> 00:13:34,010
<b>Sorry?</b>

159
00:13:35,052 --> 00:13:37,430
<b>But all of us saw that
on the news together.</b>

160
00:13:37,513 --> 00:13:39,807
<b>Just before
the video of Director Gu ended,</b>

161
00:13:39,891 --> 00:13:41,684
<b>the police intranet was breached.</b>

162
00:13:42,059 --> 00:13:45,313
<b>So the video of Hwang Deuk-gu
was disseminated to the police only,</b>

163
00:13:45,813 --> 00:13:48,816
<b>which means the public
only heard Director Gu's confession.</b>

164
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,818
<b>But that's such a hassle. Why bother?</b>

165
00:13:51,444 --> 00:13:54,947
<b>So that the media would focus on Gi-beom
and only criticize the police.</b>

166
00:13:55,031 --> 00:13:58,367
<b>They didn't want to be out in the open.</b>

167
00:13:58,951 --> 00:14:00,328
<b>It'd also serve as a warning.</b>

168
00:14:00,453 --> 00:14:02,455
<b>The cops who have received bribes
from Argos</b>

169
00:14:02,538 --> 00:14:05,791
<b>would either lie low
or avoid dealing with them altogether.</b>

170
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:07,793
<b>Hwang Deuk-gu will focus on Gi-beom.</b>

171
00:14:08,544 --> 00:14:11,005
<b>The bus will be his next target.</b>

172
00:14:11,589 --> 00:14:14,842
<b>The cop who disseminated this information
is also waiting for the right time.</b>

173
00:14:26,812 --> 00:14:28,272
<b>The cops are nowhere to be seen.</b>

174
00:14:28,356 --> 00:14:30,316
<b>I'll keep on driving
until further instructions.</b>

175
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:42,495
<b>-We should go after the hijacked bus.
-The police are tracking the bus secretly.</b>

176
00:14:43,621 --> 00:14:46,415
<b>We'll be exposed if we aren't careful,
and they'll focus on our mistakes.</b>

177
00:14:46,499 --> 00:14:50,294
<b>And they might use it
to instill fear in the public.</b>

178
00:14:50,378 --> 00:14:53,005
<b>Are you saying we should wait
for the right time</b>

179
00:14:53,589 --> 00:14:55,800
<b>because Gi-beom stepped in
as per Hwang Deuk-gu's request?</b>

180
00:14:56,384 --> 00:14:59,261
<b>That's right.
Stay focused and be on standby.</b>

181
00:15:00,137 --> 00:15:01,180
<b>-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.</b>

182
00:15:03,975 --> 00:15:05,226
<b>I hope they're okay.</b>

183
00:15:05,726 --> 00:15:08,437
<b>Gi-beom and everyone on the bus.</b>

184
00:15:12,817 --> 00:15:13,776
<b>I think</b>

185
00:15:14,276 --> 00:15:15,903
<b>this is Choi Ye-won.</b>

186
00:15:24,537 --> 00:15:27,081
<i><b>You picked up. I guess you're okay, then.</i></b>

187

188

<b>Who's this?</b>

190

<b>One of you summoned him.
And now, you're calling him.</b>

191

<b>What a disaster.</b>

192
00:15:42,638 --> 00:15:44,390
<b>There's a woman

<b>You're a woman yourself,

<b>-You intrigue me.
-<i>Mind your own business.</i></b>

197

<b>My gosh, am I that bad?</b>

198

<b>We will have more work to do then.</b>

305
00:22:35,592 --> 00:22:38,804
<b>Don't get caught until you catch them all.</b>

306
00:22:42,224 --> 00:22:43,308
<b>Roger that.</b>

307
00:22:47,078 --> 00:22:48,287
<b>Let them in.</b>

308
00:23:10,351 --> 00:23:12,854
<b>Isn't our purpose in life
to put food on the table?</b>

309
00:23:14,147 --> 00:23:15,439
<b>You're the craziest.</b>

310
00:23:16,566 --> 00:23:17,567
<b>I'm glad you finally know.</b>

311
00:23:28,661 --> 00:23:30,705
<b>I don't poison people like others,
so go ahead.</b>

312
00:23:41,048 --> 00:23:44,177
<i><b>Recovery and interference control
complete.</i></b>

313
00:23:45,088 --> 00:23:45,968
<b>Okay.</b>

314
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:47,471
<b>So,</b>

315
00:23:48,931 --> 00:23:49,932
<b>shall we begin?</b>

316
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,445
<b>This is actually good.</b>

317
00:24:04,322 --> 00:24:05,615
<b>For some reason,</b>

318
00:24:08,451 --> 00:24:12,121
<b>steaks have never been my cup of tea.</b>

319
00:24:14,582 --> 00:24:15,499
<b>You can have it.</b>

320
00:24:47,531 --> 00:24:48,366
<b>Chew.</b>

321
00:25:10,388 --> 00:25:13,349
<b>Kang Gi-beom,
how about you work for me instead?</b>

322
00:25:14,308 --> 00:25:15,142
<b>What?</b>

323
00:25:15,226 --> 00:25:17,436
<b>What's there to life
other than doing what benefits you?</b>

324
00:25:18,604 --> 00:25:20,231
<b>You held back for your wife</b>

325
00:25:20,314 --> 00:25:22,817
<b>and once again to save the world.</b>

326
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:26,487
<b>Holding back like that
will only make you ill, you know.</b>

327
00:25:27,113 --> 00:25:29,782
<b>-So?
-Your job will pretty much be the same.</b>

328
00:25:30,366 --> 00:25:33,995
<b>Operate under hidden identity,
shadow people, and punish them.</b>

329
00:25:34,078 --> 00:25:37,206
<b>And then at times, you kill them.</b>

330
00:25:39,125 --> 00:25:42,670
<b>Taking my hand will be quite entertaining.</b>

331
00:25:43,296 --> 00:25:46,257
<b>Choose to enjoy your life a bit more.</b>

332
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:49,010
<b>I'm not the type to hold hands with men.</b>

333
00:25:49,593 --> 00:25:50,553
<b>You know,</b>

334
00:25:51,387 --> 00:25:53,139
<b>I was going to hear you out today,</b>

335
00:25:54,348 --> 00:25:56,726
<b>but it's just too revolting.</b>

336
00:25:56,809 --> 00:25:58,477
<b>It may be all right for you,</b>

337
00:26:00,813 --> 00:26:02,273
<b>but what about your friends?</b>

338
00:26:12,033 --> 00:26:13,993
<b>Tae-woong, leave this to me.</b>

339
00:26:14,076 --> 00:26:15,119
<b>What are you going to do?</b>

340
00:26:15,202 --> 00:26:17,496
<b>You're not comfortable
getting involved with the cops,</b>

341
00:26:17,705 --> 00:26:19,248
<b>even corrupt ones.</b>

342
00:26:19,957 --> 00:26:20,791
<b>Not for you though?</b>

343
00:26:21,917 --> 00:26:24,420
<b>I'm more flexible in a way,
so let me handle this.</b>

344
00:26:27,089 --> 00:26:29,717
<b>No, this is my business to solve.</b>

345
00:26:30,926 --> 00:26:32,053
<b>How will you do it though?</b>

346
00:26:42,063 --> 00:26:43,397
<b>-We'll now move in.
-Sure.</b>

347
00:26:46,609 --> 00:26:47,735
<b>Moving in.</b>

348
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:56,160
<b>Freeze!</b>

349
00:26:57,161 --> 00:26:59,372
<b>You are under arrest
of obstruction of justice.</b>

350
00:26:59,455 --> 00:27:02,583
<b>Don't come after me until I show myself!</b>

351
00:27:03,501 --> 00:27:04,502
<b>Arrest him.</b>

352
00:27:13,928 --> 00:27:14,929
<b>Tae-woong!</b>

353
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,808
<b>What are you thinking?</b>

354
00:27:18,891 --> 00:27:21,560
<b>Them being here means
that they can come at us at any time.</b>

355
00:27:21,644 --> 00:27:24,688
<b>The chief can fend them off once,
but not forever.</b>

356
00:27:25,272 --> 00:27:26,982
<b>How could they have known our location?</b>

357
00:27:29,068 --> 00:27:30,111
<b>We don't have a choice.</b>

358
00:27:31,654 --> 00:27:33,864
<b>I don't know anymore.
Whatever happens, happens.</b>

359
00:27:35,574 --> 00:27:37,034
<b>All I'm protecting now are Rugal</b>

360
00:27:38,202 --> 00:27:39,912
<b>and the victims of Argos.</b>

361
00:27:45,459 --> 00:27:47,128
<b>It's not like he's wrong, I guess.</b>

362
00:27:47,211 --> 00:27:50,256
<b>Gwang-cheol, you drive that one.</b>

363
00:27:50,965 --> 00:27:53,426
<b>-Why?
-We should take them to a hospital.</b>

364
00:27:53,509 --> 00:27:55,136
<b>Right, of course.</b>

365
00:28:05,646 --> 00:28:08,065
<b>Fuck, where was it embedded?</b>

366
00:28:13,237 --> 00:28:14,905
<b>Damn it!</b>

367
00:28:23,289 --> 00:28:24,582
<b>Let go of me.</b>

368
00:28:25,166 --> 00:28:26,709
<b>"Mentally and physically incompetent."</b>

369
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:29,128
<b>You didn't think I meant it?</b>

370
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:35,676
<b>-You have one day.
-Hwang Deuk-gu!</b>

371
00:28:42,766 --> 00:28:45,311
<b>Eliminate one and you'll live.</b>

372
00:28:46,770 --> 00:28:49,231
<b>Eliminate both and I'll take it out.</b>

373
00:29:42,993 --> 00:29:44,787
<b>I heard there was a commotion yesterday.</b>

374
00:29:45,496 --> 00:29:47,706
<b>Does it perhaps have anything to do with</b>

375
00:29:48,624 --> 00:29:49,917
<b>Hwang Deuk-gu running wild?</b>

376
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:54,755
<b>You're saying that like it's our fault.</b>

377
00:29:54,838 --> 00:29:57,841
<b>He's not one to be reasonable
with his actions.</b>

378
00:29:57,925 --> 00:29:59,510
<b>And judging by the way you ask,</b>

379
00:29:59,593 --> 00:30:02,513
<b>it seems like
you're out of your depth with him too.</b>

380
00:30:04,598 --> 00:30:06,100
<b>How about I show you otherwise?</b>

381
00:30:13,816 --> 00:30:14,775
<b>Mr. Bong.</b>

382
00:30:14,858 --> 00:30:15,818
<b>Yes?</b>

383
00:30:16,485 --> 00:30:17,361
<b>Didn't you</b>

384
00:30:18,737 --> 00:30:20,698
<b>make dinner plans
with Hwang Deuk-gu this evening?</b>

385
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,535
<b>Yes, of course.</b>

386
00:30:28,956 --> 00:30:30,666
<b>We'll eliminate him then.</b>

387
00:30:31,292 --> 00:30:32,126
<b>Sure.</b>

388
00:30:33,168 --> 00:30:35,254
<b>-Have you finally made up your mind?
-But first,</b>

389
00:30:35,337 --> 00:30:37,965
<b>I'd like to see if everyone here is loyal.</b>

390
00:30:44,597 --> 00:30:47,600
<b>There's secret information
you share with Hwang Deuk-gu.</b>

391
00:30:48,309 --> 00:30:49,226
<b>What is it?</b>

392
00:30:49,893 --> 00:30:53,063
<b>-What?
-Are you hiding something from us?</b>

393
00:31:00,779 --> 00:31:02,031
<b>You're ganging up on me?</b>

394
00:31:04,074 --> 00:31:05,909
<b>Madame Jang, I'm disappointed.</b>

395
00:31:06,493 --> 00:31:07,828
<b>What are you talking about?</b>

396
00:31:08,162 --> 00:31:10,831
<b>I'm only asking
because I heard the rumors too.</b>

397
00:31:11,498 --> 00:31:13,292
<b>You rat bastard.</b>

398
00:31:14,168 --> 00:31:15,836
<b>You've been looking into me

399
00:31:17,421 --> 00:31:19,798
<b>Bong Man-cheol, you!</b>

400
00:31:28,891 --> 00:31:30,684
<b>What the hell are you doing?</b>

401
00:31:33,604 --> 00:31:35,356
<b>One of you</b>

402

00:31:37,816 --> 00:31:39,234
<b>And there we have it.</b>

404
00:31:39,818 --> 00:31:41,987
<b>-The traitor.
-Shut up!</b>

405
00:31:42,071 --> 00:31:43,614
<b>Hwang Deuk-gu ordered this, didn't he?</b>

406
00:31:45,324 --> 00:31:46,742
<b>Calm down.</b>

407
00:31:46,867 --> 00:31:49,328
<b>Calm down and listen to me.</b>

408

<b>You're just the same.</b>

409

<b>After all the crap you threw my way, you--</b>

<b>This evening...</b>

<b>This evening?</b>

412
00:32:39,878 --> 00:32:42,548
<b>You, Choi Ye-won,</b>

<b>listen up.</b>

414
00:32:44,883 --> 00:32:46,260
<b>I am now declaring war.</b>

415
00:32:47,636 --> 00:32:49,221
<b>If you manage to stay alive,</b>

416
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:51,473
<b>you'll either bow down to me</b>

417

<b>or just disappear.</b>

418

<b>You...</b>

<b>-Mi-joo.
-Yes?</b>

<b>Just stay here.</b>

<b>Bong Man-cheol...</b>

<b>You're telling me

<b>A corpse or what-not,</b>

<b>So just stay put for a while.</b>

<b>This isn't the time to uphold principles.</b>

<b>One wrong move

<b>CLIENT</b>

431
00:34:54,346 --> 00:34:56,223
<b>Didn't I tell you not to call?</b>

432
00:34:56,306 --> 00:34:57,683
<b>Can you come over?</b>

433
00:34:57,766 --> 00:34:58,976
<b>I need protection.</b>

434
00:35:01,895 --> 00:35:04,481
<b>Who the hell are you giving orders to?</b>

435

<b>Think of it as a deal. Give and take.</b>

<b>Will you pass up on a chance

<b>Tell me your offer first.</b>

<b>Hear it for yourself in person.</b>

<b>See the merchandise

<b>Send the location.</b>

<b>If the deal isn't worth it,</b>

<b>I'll come after you first.</b>

443

<b>That'll never be the case.</b>

444

<b>Now, hurry.</b>

445
00:35:29,339 --> 00:35:31,633
<b>You said actions speak louder than words.</b>

446

<b>She seemed urgent

<b>Was it Choi Ye-won?</b>

449
00:35:38,682 --> 00:35:39,808
<b>We should.</b>

450
00:35:40,309 --> 00:35:41,310
<b>Sounds exciting to me.</b>

451

<b>KO YONG-DEOK'S RESIDENCE</b>

<b>It is Ko Yong-deok's residence.</b>

<b>by Choi Yeo-won

00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,302
<b>The video</b>

461
00:36:15,802 --> 00:36:17,721
<b>will then be used
as leverage within Argos.</b>

462
00:36:18,805 --> 00:36:21,600
<b>You killed the nation's evilest killer,</b>

463
00:36:22,017 --> 00:36:23,936
<b>so you'll be applauded for it, right?</b>

464
00:36:24,728 --> 00:36:25,729
<b>However,</b>

465
00:36:27,064 --> 00:36:28,649
<b>your grand finale would be</b>

466
00:36:30,692 --> 00:36:31,693
<b>this.</b>

467
00:36:32,694 --> 00:36:33,737
<b>It won't be able to</b>

468
00:36:34,571 --> 00:36:36,073
<b>properly function in here.</b>

469
00:36:36,156 --> 00:36:39,451
<b>Who knows its function
better than its owner?</b>

470
00:36:40,118 --> 00:36:42,913
<b>I admit that my artificial eyes
are desirable to just about anyone.</b>

471
00:36:42,996 --> 00:36:46,458
<b>-It truly is mesmerizing.
-Is that so?</b>

472
00:36:46,541 --> 00:36:48,710
<b>A taxidermy animal head
is worth more if it's smiling.</b>

473
00:36:48,794 --> 00:36:51,129
<b>So smile, Deuk-gu. You never know.</b>

474
00:36:51,713 --> 00:36:53,632
<b>I just might graciously forgive you.</b>

475
00:36:54,216 --> 00:36:58,095
<b>I'll crush you
and dig those eyes out myself.</b>

476
00:37:51,273 --> 00:37:53,316
<b>One of us has to die for it to end.</b>

477
00:37:53,859 --> 00:37:56,319
<b>Being the generous one,
I'll let you die instead.</b>

478
00:38:00,949 --> 00:38:02,993
<b>You arrogant bastard.</b>

479
00:38:10,333 --> 00:38:13,295
<b>This sure is a lot.</b>

480
00:38:22,429 --> 00:38:23,722
<b>Don't just stand there. Get him.</b>

481
00:39:37,921 --> 00:39:40,340
<b>You foolish idiot.</b>

482
00:39:45,387 --> 00:39:47,889
<b>Ta-da. Got any more left in you?</b>

483
00:39:51,351 --> 00:39:52,727
<b>Where should I shoot first?</b>

484
00:39:52,811 --> 00:39:54,938
<b>Your brain isn't a robot too, is it?</b>

485
00:39:57,649 --> 00:39:58,733
<b>Goodbye,</b>

486
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,903
<b>Kang Gi-beom.</b>

487
00:40:24,843 --> 00:40:26,303
<b>What the fuck?</b>

488
00:40:51,995 --> 00:40:53,163
<b>Seol Min-jun?</b>

489
00:40:55,207 --> 00:40:57,667
<b>What the fuck do you think you're doing?</b>

490
00:40:59,336 --> 00:41:00,420
<b>That's enough.</b>

491
00:41:18,396 --> 00:41:21,566
<b>Why the hell are they fighting each other?
I'm grateful.</b>

492
00:41:21,650 --> 00:41:24,069
<b>Choi Ye-won lacks followers.
No wonder she's urgent.</b>

493
00:41:24,152 --> 00:41:25,111
<b>Shall we go in?</b>

494
00:41:27,364 --> 00:41:29,241
<b>The place once used to be impenetrable,</b>

495
00:41:29,991 --> 00:41:31,868
<b>but now it's nothing but a mess.</b>

496
00:41:51,137 --> 00:41:52,222
<b>It seems like</b>

497
00:41:53,223 --> 00:41:55,767
<b>fate is not on your side.</b>

498
00:42:07,946 --> 00:42:08,947
<b>Get them.</b>

499
00:42:22,669 --> 00:42:24,004
<b>Head that way.</b>

500
00:43:20,393 --> 00:43:22,812
<b>Chief, I made it out.</b>

501
00:43:22,896 --> 00:43:25,482
<b>It didn't exactly go as planned,
but Seol Min-jun came to my aid.</b>

502
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:28,401
<b>Seol Min-jun?</b>

503
00:43:29,944 --> 00:43:33,073
<b>-What about Hwang Deuk-gu?
-He lured Hwang Deuk-gu out to help me.</b>

504
00:43:33,656 --> 00:43:35,658
<b>He texted me once</b>

505
00:43:35,742 --> 00:43:37,827
<b>after we saw him at the reservoir.</b>

506
00:43:37,911 --> 00:43:39,537
<b>He seemed to come back to his old self.</b>

507
00:43:40,288 --> 00:43:42,248
<b>It didn't seem like
he was under someone's control.</b>

508
00:43:42,499 --> 00:43:44,667
<i><b>Dr. Oh probably helped him too.</i></b>

509
00:43:44,751 --> 00:43:47,170
<b>He wouldn't have blown his cover</b>

510
00:43:47,545 --> 00:43:49,464
<b>unless things were urgent though.</b>

511
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:52,342
<b>I'll look for Seol Min-jun, sir.</b>

512
00:43:52,425 --> 00:43:53,718
<b>Good.</b>

513
00:43:58,056 --> 00:44:00,016
<b>I hope he hangs in there.</b>

514
00:44:29,587 --> 00:44:31,131
<b>Don't be too hurt over this.</b>

515
00:45:23,183 --> 00:45:24,267
<b>Gwang-cheol.</b>

516
00:45:41,743 --> 00:45:43,495
<b>-He's dead.
-It wasn't Madame Jang.</b>

517
00:45:44,078 --> 00:45:45,413
<b>She's not bold enough to do this.</b>

518
00:45:45,997 --> 00:45:47,790
<b>Then could it have been Choi Yong?</b>

519
00:45:48,958 --> 00:45:49,792
<b>Probably.</b>

520
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:53,713
<b>He'll also target Hwang Deuk-gu
then oust Choi Ye-won.</b>

521
00:45:56,257 --> 00:45:57,675
<b>How savage.</b>

522
00:46:12,357 --> 00:46:14,275
<b>This is the only place I haven't searched.</b>

523
00:46:14,776 --> 00:46:16,110
<b>I'm coming in.</b>

524
00:46:34,295 --> 00:46:36,130
<b>First, let's see what you can offer.</b>

525
00:46:53,856 --> 00:46:56,693
<b>You perfectly fooled me.</b>

526
00:46:57,610 --> 00:46:58,945
<b>How did you do it?</b>

527
00:46:59,529 --> 00:47:00,655
<b>I thought you were loyal.</b>

528
00:47:02,031 --> 00:47:03,992
<b>Were you just anticipating a chance?</b>

529
00:47:19,382 --> 00:47:21,092
<b>You don't even deserve this bullet.</b>

530
00:47:38,526 --> 00:47:41,195
<b>Dr. Oh refused to help you.</b>

531
00:47:41,529 --> 00:47:43,656
<b>-But not me.
-What?</b>

532
00:47:45,366 --> 00:47:47,201
<b>Are you telling me that he took a look</b>

533
00:47:47,827 --> 00:47:49,037
<b>at your head?</b>

534
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:51,372
<b>I was planning to wait it out,</b>

535
00:47:51,456 --> 00:47:52,915
<b>but I couldn't bear</b>

536
00:47:53,958 --> 00:47:55,460
<b>with your filthy deeds.</b>

537
00:47:57,670 --> 00:48:00,131
<b>That's a bit rich coming from you.</b>

538
00:48:00,298 --> 00:48:01,841
<b>You've done a lot of filthy shit for me.</b>

539
00:48:02,634 --> 00:48:04,177
<b>You won't get your way.</b>

540
00:48:17,273 --> 00:48:19,233
<b>You won't die as you wish.</b>

541
00:48:20,943 --> 00:48:24,113
<b>Do you think I'd allow that?</b>

542
00:48:36,015 --> 00:48:37,266
<b>I don't see him.</b>

543
00:48:37,850 --> 00:48:38,851
<b>I'll keep searching.</b>

544
00:48:38,934 --> 00:48:41,479
<b>Since he failed to kill you,
he'll try to blow up the bus.</b>

545
00:48:42,146 --> 00:48:43,898
<b>We're running out of time. Hurry.</b>

546
00:48:43,981 --> 00:48:45,524
<b>Yes, sir.</b>

547
00:49:02,792 --> 00:49:04,543
<b>What the fuck?</b>

548
00:49:36,909 --> 00:49:40,704
<b>I didn't know I'd bring so many people
over through one call.</b>

549
00:49:40,788 --> 00:49:42,873
<b>First, thanks.</b>

550
00:49:43,374 --> 00:49:47,002
<b>But next time,
I'd like to see Gi-beom as well.</b>

551
00:49:47,086 --> 00:49:49,255
<b>Life is no fun if you always get your way.</b>

552
00:49:51,382 --> 00:49:53,050
<b>We'll take that body.</b>

553
00:49:53,926 --> 00:49:56,512
<b>It's crucial evidence,
but you just abandoned it.</b>

554
00:49:57,430 --> 00:49:59,515
<b>I wasn't planning on this,
but I guess we're even now.</b>

555
00:50:00,182 --> 00:50:01,517
<b>This will put me in a tight spot.</b>

556
00:50:02,184 --> 00:50:03,394
<b>That's like a trophy to us.</b>

557
00:50:03,477 --> 00:50:05,771
<b>We still have business between us,
so don't misunderstand.</b>

558
00:50:08,149 --> 00:50:09,191
<b>I'll see you next time.</b>

559
00:50:10,568 --> 00:50:13,279
<b>I know that we've become acquainted,</b>

560
00:50:13,362 --> 00:50:16,449
<b>but isn't it best
that we don't see each other often?</b>

561
00:50:17,908 --> 00:50:19,368
<b>Make Bong Man-cheol's death</b>

562
00:50:20,202 --> 00:50:21,954
<b>look accidental.</b>

563
00:50:22,788 --> 00:50:24,415
<b>I don't want to get involved.</b>

564
00:50:30,045 --> 00:50:30,880
<i><b>Tae-woong.</i></b>

565
00:50:32,423 --> 00:50:33,716
<b>One minute.</b>

566
00:50:47,938 --> 00:50:50,149
<i><b>-Are you hurt?</i>
-No. Where are you?</b>

567
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:52,568
<b>We're at Ko Yong-deok's place.</b>

568
00:50:53,068 --> 00:50:54,904
<b>Bong Man-cheol was killed
by someone inside.</b>

569
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:57,573
<b>It must be a mess over there.</b>

570
00:50:58,616 --> 00:50:59,450
<b>You're right.</b>

571
00:51:00,034 --> 00:51:01,410
<b>I have a lot to tell you.</b>

572
00:51:02,912 --> 00:51:04,330
<b>I have a lot to tell you too.</b>

573
00:51:08,584 --> 00:51:09,960
<b>We'll be there soon</b>

574
00:51:10,044 --> 00:51:11,629
<b>after handing a body over to the police.</b>

575
00:51:25,351 --> 00:51:27,144
<b>I knew it, you betraying asshole.</b>

576
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:29,980
<b>Don't touch him.</b>

577
00:51:30,648 --> 00:51:31,690
<b>Sir.</b>

578
00:51:35,611 --> 00:51:38,155
<b>He's not yours to punish.</b>

579
00:52:10,854 --> 00:52:13,649
<b>You're supposed to be the vice-chairman,
but where in the world are you?</b>

580
00:52:13,732 --> 00:52:16,777
<i><b>I guess something happened
for you to take interest in me.</i></b>

581
00:52:17,903 --> 00:52:20,447
<b>Choi Yong killed Bong Man-cheol

582
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:22,241
<b>Oh, dear.</b>

583
00:52:23,367 --> 00:52:26,829
<b>He should've died as well.
What a stupid scumbag.</b>

584
00:52:26,912 --> 00:52:29,331
<b>-What did you just say?
-<i>Never mind. So?</i></b>

585
00:52:29,915 --> 00:52:33,919
<b>I doubt you were even slightly fazed.</b>

586
00:52:34,503 --> 00:52:36,130
<b>They took the body.</b>

587
00:52:36,714 --> 00:52:38,215
<b>I think they're Kang Gi-beom's people.</b>

588
00:52:39,633 --> 00:52:40,467
<b>By the way,</b>

589
00:52:41,719 --> 00:52:44,513
<b>why were you all gathered except me?</b>

590
00:52:45,723 --> 00:52:47,891
<b>You're always so busy.</b>

591
00:52:48,892 --> 00:52:50,269
<b>What happened to Gi-beom?</b>

592
00:52:51,395 --> 00:52:54,148
<b>I wanted to stuff his body</b>

593
00:52:54,231 --> 00:52:56,275
<b>so that you'd get to see him
for a long time.</b>

594
00:52:56,358 --> 00:52:58,485
<b>But he's a tenacious one.</b>

595
00:52:59,069 --> 00:53:00,904
<b>Any hindrance to our organization</b>

596
00:53:00,988 --> 00:53:03,032
<b>should be eliminated.</b>

597
00:53:05,784 --> 00:53:09,121
<b>You're finally sounding like a chairwoman.</b>

598
00:53:10,247 --> 00:53:11,123
<b>Come here right now.</b>

599
00:53:11,707 --> 00:53:14,001
<b>Okay, I'll be there soon.</b>

600
00:54:40,170 --> 00:54:42,256
<b>I read the files.</b>

601
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:44,216
<b>"Rugal," was it?</b>

602
00:54:44,508 --> 00:54:45,801
<b>That's enough.</b>

603
00:54:47,553 --> 00:54:49,930
<b>They seem hardworking,
so why are you throwing them away?</b>

604
00:54:50,514 --> 00:54:53,267
<b>What can you do with high-maintenance dogs
without leashes?</b>

605
00:54:53,934 --> 00:54:55,811
<b>I need to take measures.</b>

606
00:54:56,812 --> 00:54:57,813
<b>It sounds like</b>

607
00:54:58,272 --> 00:55:00,232
<b>you want me to hear it.</b>

608
00:55:00,899 --> 00:55:03,152
<b>You interfered during the news,
messed with the Commissioner-General,</b>

609
00:55:03,235 --> 00:55:05,404
<b>and even abducted people

610

<b>If you keep this up, I won't be able

611
00:55:10,576 --> 00:55:12,244
<b>Is that so? Then how about this?</b>

612
00:55:12,911 --> 00:55:15,456
<b>How about a gas massacre</b>
