<b>(Episode 15)</b>

2
00:01:28,027 --> 00:01:29,627
<b>Man, Jeong Hoon.</b>

3
00:01:29,887 --> 00:01:32,426
<b>I thought you
already left by yourself.</b>

4
00:01:36,696 --> 00:01:39,066
<b>You'll probably figure it out soon,</b>

5
00:01:39,797 --> 00:01:41,167
<b>so I'll spill the truth first.</b>

6
00:01:41,966 --> 00:01:42,966
<b>What is it?</b>

7
00:01:43,807 --> 00:01:45,207
<b>I installed...</b>

8
00:01:46,576 --> 00:01:48,407
<b>a location tracking app
on your phone.</b>

9
00:01:50,477 --> 00:01:52,676
<b>It was just in case
anything happens to you.</b>

10
00:01:53,176 --> 00:01:56,487
<b>Thankfully, the passcode
for your phone was the same.</b>

11
00:01:57,487 --> 00:01:58,716
<b>I'll delete it now.</b>

12
00:01:59,686 --> 00:02:01,987
<b>But please don't disappear
all of a sudden.</b>

13
00:02:03,127 --> 00:02:05,426
<b>Are you
still that concerned about me?</b>

14
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:09,597
<b>Once I die, you'll only have...</b>

15
00:02:09,597 --> 00:02:12,767
<b>memories of how you were
worried and concerned about me.</b>

16
00:02:12,767 --> 00:02:14,536
<b>Did you just figure that out?</b>

17
00:02:14,737 --> 00:02:18,137
<b>I guess your conscience says
that you're actually sorry for me.</b>

18
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:25,576
<b>Ever since Seo Yeon passed away,</b>

19
00:02:26,977 --> 00:02:29,246
<b>I only had this thought on my mind.</b>

20
00:02:30,417 --> 00:02:32,787
<b>"I will never make
another painful memory..."</b>

21
00:02:33,787 --> 00:02:36,387
<b>"with another person."</b>

22
00:02:37,527 --> 00:02:39,626
<b>That was the only goal I had.</b>

23
00:02:41,126 --> 00:02:42,626
<b>Don't I sound like a fool?</b>

24
00:02:42,927 --> 00:02:46,537
<b>Why didn't I want to make
more good memories?</b>

25
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:50,067
<b>My mother lived her life...</b>

26
00:02:50,067 --> 00:02:52,477
<b>trying to give me
only good memories.</b>

27
00:02:56,606 --> 00:03:00,177
<b>I don't want to live my life
making everyone worried like a kid.</b>

28
00:03:00,177 --> 00:03:02,617
<b>I never thought of it
as you making me worried.</b>

29
00:03:02,617 --> 00:03:04,186
<b>Don't say that.</b>

30
00:03:04,456 --> 00:03:07,856
<b>Then will you just sit around
if I break down like you did?</b>

31
00:03:08,927 --> 00:03:10,897
<b>That's what friends do.</b>

32
00:03:10,897 --> 00:03:12,057
<b>Exactly.</b>

33
00:03:13,356 --> 00:03:15,897
<b>I take back asking you
to fix my disease.</b>

34
00:03:16,667 --> 00:03:18,796
<b>You can just be a friend
from now on.</b>

35
00:03:19,837 --> 00:03:22,407
<b>You don't have to be
my doctor or guardian.</b>

36
00:03:39,387 --> 00:03:40,956
<b>Goodness, what is this?</b>

37
00:03:40,956 --> 00:03:42,627
<b>Ha Jin, Ha Kyung.</b>

38
00:03:42,627 --> 00:03:43,896
<b>Girls!</b>

39
00:03:43,896 --> 00:03:46,757
<b>Hey, are you two okay?
Was everything all right?</b>

40
00:03:46,757 --> 00:03:48,266
<b>What about Ha Jin? Where is she?</b>

41
00:03:48,266 --> 00:03:49,866
<b>What's wrong? Is something going on?</b>

42
00:03:49,866 --> 00:03:52,766
<b>Someone spray-painted
the security cameras black.</b>

43
00:03:52,766 --> 00:03:54,537
<b>Are you sure everything is okay?</b>

44
00:04:05,676 --> 00:04:07,016
<b>Why is the door locked?</b>

45
00:04:07,586 --> 00:04:09,217
<b>Ha Jin! Ha Jin!</b>

46
00:04:09,217 --> 00:04:10,417
<b>Ha Jin!</b>

47
00:04:11,486 --> 00:04:12,956
<b>Open the door!</b>

48
00:04:12,956 --> 00:04:14,056
<b>Are you in there?</b>

49
00:04:14,056 --> 00:04:15,986
<b>Ha Jin! Answer me!</b>

50
00:04:15,986 --> 00:04:17,727
<b>- Ha Jin!
- Are you in there?</b>

51
00:04:17,727 --> 00:04:19,796
<b>- Answer us!
- Ha Jin!</b>

52
00:04:19,796 --> 00:04:22,796
<b>- Ha Jin!
- Darn it, why won't this open?</b>

53
00:04:22,796 --> 00:04:24,167
<b>- Ha Jin!
- Are you in there?</b>

54
00:04:24,167 --> 00:04:25,997
<b>- Ha Jin! Are you there?
- Ha Jin!</b>

55
00:04:25,997 --> 00:04:27,537
<b>- Ha Jin!
- My gosh.</b>

56
00:04:27,537 --> 00:04:29,907
<b>- Why are they making a fuss?
- Ha Jin!</b>

57
00:04:30,806 --> 00:04:32,706
<b>Ha Jin! Ha Jin!</b>

58
00:04:32,706 --> 00:04:33,907
<b>Ha Jin!</b>

59
00:04:33,907 --> 00:04:36,176
<b>Ha Jin, open the door!</b>

60
00:04:36,907 --> 00:04:38,516
<b>Ha Jin! Ha Jin!</b>

61
00:04:38,516 --> 00:04:39,717
<b>Ha Jin!</b>

62
00:04:40,847 --> 00:04:42,217
<b>Open the door!</b>

63
00:04:42,217 --> 00:04:44,317
<b>Are you in there? Ha Jin!</b>

64
00:04:45,116 --> 00:04:46,887
<b>(Ha Jin, you're mine.)</b>

65
00:04:55,127 --> 00:04:57,067
<b>What is all this?</b>

66
00:04:58,497 --> 00:05:00,667
<b>Ha Jin, open up!</b>

67
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:02,366
<b>- You're in there, right?
- Darn it!</b>

68
00:05:02,766 --> 00:05:04,676
<b>Break it open!</b>

69
00:05:05,736 --> 00:05:07,137
<b>Ha Jin, are you okay?</b>

70
00:05:11,217 --> 00:05:14,717
<b>My goodness, what is that?</b>

71
00:05:19,387 --> 00:05:21,287
<b>Darn it.</b>

72
00:05:47,346 --> 00:05:50,216
<b>It's not just tough for you.
It's tough for everyone.</b>

73
00:05:51,216 --> 00:05:55,326
<b>Everyone gets sad
when they lose someone they love...</b>

74
00:05:55,326 --> 00:05:56,387
<b>because of their memories...</b>

75
00:05:58,596 --> 00:05:59,826
<b>Not you.</b>

76
00:06:01,726 --> 00:06:03,127
<b>You forgot everything.</b>

77
00:06:03,766 --> 00:06:06,567
<b>You forgot everything, and you live
as if nothing had happened.</b>

78
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:09,637
<b>So stop talking
as if you know everything.</b>

79
00:06:42,107 --> 00:06:43,437
<b>(Director Choi)</b>

80
00:06:43,437 --> 00:06:45,507
<b>(This is your last chance. Call me
as soon as you see this message.)</b>

81
00:06:57,146 --> 00:06:58,487
<b>Hello, ma'am.</b>

82
00:06:59,456 --> 00:07:00,726
<b>What's wrong with you?</b>

83
00:07:01,857 --> 00:07:03,786
<b>What were you thinking?</b>

84
00:07:04,656 --> 00:07:06,297
<b>I'm sorry for not calling.</b>

85
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:08,726
<b>Are you okay?</b>

86
00:07:09,427 --> 00:07:11,497
<b>You seem better.</b>

87
00:07:13,396 --> 00:07:14,536
<b>Sit down.</b>

88
00:07:24,817 --> 00:07:26,976
<b>You know your leave
is until tomorrow, right?</b>

89
00:07:29,146 --> 00:07:30,757
<b>Will you be able to work
starting in two days?</b>

90
00:07:34,927 --> 00:07:36,086
<b>I want...</b>

91
00:07:37,257 --> 00:07:38,557
<b>to work again.</b>

92
00:07:40,057 --> 00:07:44,697
<b>But I can't promise you
that I'm fully recovered.</b>

93
00:07:44,697 --> 00:07:47,706
<b>Come back to work.
The news is all that you have.</b>

94
00:07:48,336 --> 00:07:49,836
<b>What else can you do?</b>

95
00:07:51,276 --> 00:07:52,836
<b>Remember how I said...</b>

96
00:07:53,476 --> 00:07:55,206
<b>I can't gamble with this?</b>

97
00:07:55,846 --> 00:07:59,146
<b>But I realized that I already was.</b>

98
00:07:59,716 --> 00:08:01,786
<b>Appointing you as the anchor
of "Lee Jeong Hoon's News Live"...</b>

99
00:08:01,786 --> 00:08:03,247
<b>was a gamble for me.</b>

100
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:06,117
<b>The others said no, but I insisted.</b>

101
00:08:06,656 --> 00:08:09,086
<b>So if I were to let you go
in order to save face,</b>

102
00:08:09,726 --> 00:08:11,156
<b>what would that make me?</b>

103
00:08:11,757 --> 00:08:13,596
<b>Let me be cool for once.</b>

104
00:08:14,497 --> 00:08:15,666
<b>You can do it.</b>

105
00:08:16,927 --> 00:08:18,166
<b>So come back.</b>

106
00:08:23,536 --> 00:08:25,177
<b>The envelope and the photos?</b>

107
00:08:25,437 --> 00:08:27,706
<b>Yes, I want to check
everything that was sent.</b>

108
00:08:28,276 --> 00:08:30,276
<b>I believe Jeong Hoon has it.</b>

109
00:08:30,706 --> 00:08:32,016
<b>I'll look for it.</b>

110
00:08:32,216 --> 00:08:34,786
<b>But why all of a sudden?
Is something wrong?</b>

111
00:08:36,487 --> 00:08:38,187
<b>Yes, something's wrong.</b>

112
00:08:55,437 --> 00:08:57,336
<b>What? Jeong Hoon!</b>

113
00:08:59,107 --> 00:09:01,807
<b>What's your deal?
You're alive and well,</b>

114
00:09:01,807 --> 00:09:03,776
<b>yet you refused to pick up my calls
or text back.</b>

115
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,076
<b>Are you that upset
that I'm doing fine?</b>

116
00:09:06,076 --> 00:09:09,716
<b>You know that's not what I meant.
I was worried sick.</b>

117
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:11,216
<b>Have you been well?</b>

118
00:09:11,387 --> 00:09:12,557
<b>Of course.</b>

119
00:09:12,987 --> 00:09:17,026
<b>By the way, did you hear
about Ha Jin?</b>

120
00:09:18,127 --> 00:09:19,257
<b>Hear what?</b>

121

<b>(I'm always watching you.)</b>

<b>Hello, Anchor Lee.</b>

<b>Where are you? Are you home?</b>

124
00:09:40,887 --> 00:09:42,447
<b>Yes, I am.</b>

125
00:09:44,146 --> 00:09:45,786
<b>Where are you?</b>

126
00:09:45,786 --> 00:09:49,087
<b>I'm on my way to your house.
I'll be there soon.</b>

127

<b>You're coming here?</b>

128

<b>Hey.</b>

129
00:10:11,276 --> 00:10:12,676
<b>Hey.</b>

130

<b>Are you okay?</b>

<b>Yes.</b>

<b>I'm sorry

<b>I know I promised to stay with you.</b>

134

<b>Don't be sorry.</b>

135
00:10:25,127 --> 00:10:27,526
<b>You should be worried

<b>(Get ready. We'll meet soon.)</b>

138

<b>Did you report to the police?</b>

139
00:10:47,446 --> 00:10:48,987
<b>No, not yet.</b>

140
00:10:49,286 --> 00:10:52,516
<b>We don't want the media
to be talking about this right now.</b>

141
00:10:52,516 --> 00:10:54,827
<b>Ms. Park is speaking with a lawyer.</b>

142

<b>May I look around your room?</b>

143
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:07,036
<b>The stalker could've installed
cameras or listening devices.</b>

144
00:11:08,507 --> 00:11:10,806
<b>Sure. It's upstairs.</b>

145
00:11:34,696 --> 00:11:36,727
<b>I didn't know it was this serious.</b>

146
00:11:37,396 --> 00:11:39,296
<b>Why would someone do this?</b>

147
00:11:40,766 --> 00:11:42,166
<b>Don't worry too much.</b>

148
00:11:43,507 --> 00:11:46,007
<b>You'll be fine.
I'll make sure of that.</b>

149
00:11:47,776 --> 00:11:50,146
<b>Okay. Thanks.</b>

<b>(Medication)</b>

151
00:12:18,176 --> 00:12:20,207
<b>I don't see anything in particular.</b>

152
00:12:20,707 --> 00:12:24,477
<b>But I think it's best
to hire someone to take a look.</b>

153
00:12:25,316 --> 00:12:26,316
<b>Okay.</b>

154
00:12:26,316 --> 00:12:28,646
<b>By the way, are you sick?</b>

155
00:12:29,747 --> 00:12:31,117
<b>I saw your medication.</b>

156
00:12:33,516 --> 00:12:36,987
<b>I had come down with a flu.
I'm all better now.</b>

<b>I'm sorry...</b>

158
00:12:40,056 --> 00:12:42,066
<b>about that day
and yesterday as well.</b>

159
00:12:43,696 --> 00:12:46,936
<b>Please don't take to heart
what I said to you at my house.</b>

160
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:50,906
<b>I just vented my anger on you.</b>

161
00:12:50,906 --> 00:12:52,176
<b>I didn't mean any of it.</b>

162
00:12:54,276 --> 00:12:57,377
<b>Okay. I'll just think that
you were drunk and rambling.</b>

163
00:12:58,377 --> 00:13:01,046
<b>If you're truly sorry,
don't ever drink again.</b>

164
00:13:02,286 --> 00:13:05,516
<b>You have a terrible drinking habit.</b>

165
00:13:11,196 --> 00:13:14,026
<b>Let's go. Where's Ha Jin?</b>

166
00:13:14,026 --> 00:13:15,967
<b>She's upstairs. Anchor Lee is here.</b>

167
00:13:15,967 --> 00:13:17,396
<b>He is?</b>

168
00:13:17,796 --> 00:13:20,166
<b>Oh, my. Hello, sir.</b>

169
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:22,007
<b>- Hello.
- Hello.</b>

170
00:13:22,007 --> 00:13:25,077
<b>Ha Jin, have you packed everything?</b>

171
00:13:25,077 --> 00:13:26,477
<b>I'm still packing.</b>

172
00:13:26,477 --> 00:13:29,007
<b>Just pack the things you need.</b>

173
00:13:29,007 --> 00:13:30,676
<b>- Okay.
- Are you going somewhere?</b>

174
00:13:30,676 --> 00:13:33,776
<b>We're going to a hotel.
We don't want to stay here anymore.</b>

175
00:13:33,776 --> 00:13:36,816
<b>Don't you think it'd be dangerous
since there are many strangers?</b>

176
00:13:37,016 --> 00:13:38,556
<b>Is there anywhere else you could go?</b>

177
00:13:39,587 --> 00:13:43,627
<b>My parents live too far away,
and I don't want to worry them.</b>

178
00:13:43,627 --> 00:13:48,597
<b>We're looking for a place
she can move into right away.</b>

179
00:13:48,597 --> 00:13:51,137
<b>I won't be staying there for long,
so you don't have to worry.</b>

180
00:13:52,137 --> 00:13:55,536
<b>I'll look into it.
Give me some time.</b>

181
00:13:57,936 --> 00:13:59,077
<b>Where?</b>

182
00:14:01,406 --> 00:14:04,406
<b>Father, I got this herbal tea
as a gift recently.</b>

183
00:14:04,406 --> 00:14:06,377
<b>Try it. It's really fragrant.</b>

184
00:14:06,816 --> 00:14:07,816
<b>Okay.</b>

185
00:14:09,247 --> 00:14:11,556
<b>So what brings you here?</b>

186
00:14:11,556 --> 00:14:13,257
<b>I don't think you're here to see me.</b>

187
00:14:14,526 --> 00:14:16,487
<b>How's Jeong Hoon?</b>

188
00:14:17,757 --> 00:14:19,926
<b>Good. He's hanging in there.</b>

189
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:22,026
<b>Professor Kim called me.</b>

190
00:14:23,997 --> 00:14:27,137
<b>I heard Jeong Hoon
received therapy recently.</b>

191
00:14:27,536 --> 00:14:30,967
<b>What? Oh, about that...</b>

192
00:14:30,967 --> 00:14:33,036
<b>What in the world is going on?</b>

193
00:14:33,977 --> 00:14:36,377
<b>I heard
you asked Prof. Kim yourself.</b>

194
00:14:39,977 --> 00:14:42,916
<b>Did you volunteer
to be his doctor...</b>

195
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:45,217
<b>so that you can keep everything
from me?</b>

196
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:47,186
<b>Is this your way of telling me
to back off?</b>

197
00:14:48,056 --> 00:14:49,286
<b>It's not like that.</b>

198
00:14:49,286 --> 00:14:51,597
<b>Then why didn't you tell me
about this?</b>

199
00:14:51,857 --> 00:14:54,796
<b>After that incident,
Jeong Hoon has not once gone there.</b>

200
00:14:54,796 --> 00:14:57,837
<b>If he went,
he must have had a reason for it.</b>

201
00:14:58,237 --> 00:15:00,166
<b>You don't need to worry about that.</b>

202
00:15:01,207 --> 00:15:02,536
<b>Does this...</b>

203
00:15:03,806 --> 00:15:06,077
<b>have to do with that woman,
Yeo Ha Jin?</b>

204
00:15:08,077 --> 00:15:10,207
<b>Is their relationship serious?</b>

205
00:15:10,747 --> 00:15:13,416
<b>Is it truly possible for him
to love another woman...</b>

206
00:15:13,776 --> 00:15:16,546
<b>with all the memories
he has about Seo Yeon?</b>

207
00:15:18,487 --> 00:15:21,117
<b>Why aren't you answering me?
You must know.</b>

208
00:15:21,117 --> 00:15:23,957
<b>I don't know
about his feelings that deeply.</b>

209
00:15:27,156 --> 00:15:29,266
<b>Yeo Ha Jin.
Her name sounded familiar,</b>

210
00:15:29,266 --> 00:15:31,166
<b>so I tried to remember
where I heard her name from.</b>

211
00:15:31,696 --> 00:15:33,396
<b>She was your patient in the past.</b>

212
00:15:33,696 --> 00:15:36,666
<b>The one who caused a problem because
you overprescribed sleeping pills.</b>

213
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:37,666
<b>Isn't she the patient?</b>

214
00:15:38,477 --> 00:15:40,237
<b>If you can't find out
through Jeong Hoon,</b>

215
00:15:40,237 --> 00:15:42,946
<b>try to keep an eye on him
through her.</b>

216
00:15:42,946 --> 00:15:44,577
<b>You still have a good relationship
with her, right?</b>

217
00:15:44,577 --> 00:15:47,046
<b>From what I know, she still came
for therapy after that incident.</b>

218
00:15:48,916 --> 00:15:50,016
<b>Dad,</b>

219
00:15:50,717 --> 00:15:52,887
<b>you're not interested
in my feelings...</b>

220
00:15:53,387 --> 00:15:55,156
<b>or my emotions, right?</b>

221
00:15:55,627 --> 00:15:56,987
<b>What on earth are you talking about?</b>

222
00:15:56,987 --> 00:15:59,827
<b>You're well aware how hard
that incident had been on me.</b>

223
00:16:00,257 --> 00:16:04,266
<b>How could you bring that up
so casually as if it's nothing?</b>

224
00:16:04,637 --> 00:16:08,467
<b>Until when will you whine
like a baby?</b>

225
00:16:09,467 --> 00:16:13,137
<b>This is why I don't acknowledge you
as a fellow doctor.</b>

226
00:16:13,137 --> 00:16:16,477
<b>Instead of overcoming
such incidents, you keep whining.</b>

227
00:16:16,946 --> 00:16:20,077
<b>You can't even control
your feelings. You're not a doctor.</b>

228
00:16:30,457 --> 00:16:31,696
<b>Which unit are you going to?</b>

229
00:16:31,696 --> 00:16:33,727
<b>We're going to Unit 701.</b>

230
00:16:35,566 --> 00:16:36,967
<b>I was informed you were coming.</b>

231
00:16:36,967 --> 00:16:38,436
<b>- This way, please.
- Okay.</b>

232
00:16:48,946 --> 00:16:51,207
<b>Getting access to this budding
as visitors is difficult.</b>

233
00:16:51,207 --> 00:16:53,016
<b>So you don't have to worry
while you stay here.</b>

234
00:16:53,016 --> 00:16:55,286
<b>My gosh, this place looks great.</b>

235
00:16:55,286 --> 00:16:57,546
<b>Are you sure we can stay here?</b>

236
00:16:57,546 --> 00:16:59,087
<b>What about the person living here?</b>

237
00:16:59,516 --> 00:17:01,827
<b>This place has been vacant
because of work.</b>

238
00:17:01,827 --> 00:17:04,087
<b>This was supposed to be vacant
for some time anyway.</b>

239
00:17:04,926 --> 00:17:06,696
<b>Feel free to stay here.</b>

240
00:17:06,696 --> 00:17:08,867
<b>By the way,
how do you know the person?</b>

241
00:17:09,467 --> 00:17:11,097
<b>Well...</b>

242
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:14,266
<b>We are close like family.</b>

243
00:17:18,536 --> 00:17:20,877
<b>Thank you for going out
of your way to help.</b>

244
00:17:20,877 --> 00:17:22,347
<b>You should go back in.</b>

245
00:17:22,347 --> 00:17:23,877
<b>Call me if there's a problem.</b>

246
00:17:24,207 --> 00:17:25,347
<b>Okay.</b>

247
00:17:26,377 --> 00:17:29,046
<b>Then, you won't suddenly disappear
into thin air again, right?</b>

248
00:17:31,587 --> 00:17:34,457
<b>You can go anywhere
or someplace far.</b>

249
00:17:34,556 --> 00:17:36,827
<b>But if you are going anywhere,
just tell me.</b>

250
00:17:37,257 --> 00:17:39,997
<b>Then, I'll know where you are
and wait for you.</b>

251
00:17:41,396 --> 00:17:43,066
<b>I can't go even if I want to now.</b>

252
00:17:43,327 --> 00:17:44,327
<b>Why not?</b>

253
00:17:44,967 --> 00:17:46,196
<b>Because of me?</b>

254
00:17:47,737 --> 00:17:49,066
<b>I have to be back
on the news program.</b>

255
00:17:49,066 --> 00:17:51,577
<b>Are you going back?
When are you starting?</b>

256
00:17:51,577 --> 00:17:52,707
<b>In two days.</b>

257
00:17:53,137 --> 00:17:54,477
<b>My leave of absence ends tomorrow.</b>

258
00:17:54,477 --> 00:17:55,906
<b>That's great!</b>

259
00:17:55,906 --> 00:17:57,877
<b>I wanted to see you lead the news.</b>

260
00:18:00,617 --> 00:18:02,186
<b>I'll call you once I get home.</b>

261
00:18:02,686 --> 00:18:04,146
<b>Get home safe.</b>

262
00:18:04,957 --> 00:18:05,957
<b>Go back in.</b>

263
00:18:28,406 --> 00:18:29,476
<b>Ha Jin.</b>

264
00:18:30,307 --> 00:18:32,347
<b>I'm certain that the owner
of this place is a man.</b>

265
00:18:32,347 --> 00:18:33,946
<b>There's a razor in the bathroom.</b>

266
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:34,946
<b>Really?</b>

267
00:18:35,186 --> 00:18:38,787
<b>The place is really clean.
And the interior design is chic.</b>

268
00:18:39,256 --> 00:18:41,256
<b>I wonder who owns this house.</b>

269
00:18:42,486 --> 00:18:43,726
<b>Is it Anchor Lee?</b>

270
00:18:43,726 --> 00:18:45,327
<b>Does he have two houses?</b>

271
00:18:45,327 --> 00:18:47,097
<b>Come on. No way.</b>

272
00:18:47,396 --> 00:18:49,696
<b>Then, how could he get a house
like this on such short notice?</b>

273
00:18:52,466 --> 00:18:53,466
<b>Ha Jin.</b>

274
00:18:55,166 --> 00:18:56,607
<b>It's about Anchor Lee.</b>

275
00:18:57,337 --> 00:18:59,706
<b>I think he has feelings for you.</b>

276
00:18:59,706 --> 00:19:00,906
<b>Do you think so?</b>

277
00:19:00,906 --> 00:19:04,206
<b>He was worried about you, so he got
a house like this right away.</b>

278
00:19:04,206 --> 00:19:07,446
<b>To call it a fake relationship,
he's way too affectionate, isn't he?</b>

279
00:19:08,246 --> 00:19:09,817
<b>You think so too, right?</b>

280
00:19:12,357 --> 00:19:14,656
<b>Goodness. Look at you smiling.</b>

281
00:19:14,926 --> 00:19:17,656
<b>Should we continue this romantic
feeling with some music?</b>

282
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:19,256
<b>I saw some records earlier.</b>

283
00:19:19,256 --> 00:19:20,756
<b>Okay. Put on a good one.</b>

284
00:19:21,196 --> 00:19:23,966
<b>Okay. I'll put on something great.</b>

285
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:29,307
<b>Ha Jin. I found
the photo of the owner!</b>

286
00:19:29,307 --> 00:19:30,307
<b>Who?</b>

287
00:19:30,367 --> 00:19:32,406
<b>Who is it? Who's the owner?</b>

288
00:19:33,176 --> 00:19:34,537
<b>I guess this was when he was young.</b>

289
00:19:36,006 --> 00:19:37,877
<b>That can't be Anchor Lee, right?</b>

290
00:19:39,176 --> 00:19:42,946
<b>Seeing how he has such a common
face, I don't think it's him.</b>

291
00:19:43,646 --> 00:19:45,617
<b>He looks familiar. Who is this?</b>

292
00:19:48,186 --> 00:19:50,057
<b>Who am I to you?</b>

293
00:19:50,057 --> 00:19:53,327
<b>I'm your only junior reporter,
Jo Il Kwon.</b>

294
00:19:53,426 --> 00:19:55,496
<b>Of course, I ought to help you out.</b>

295
00:19:55,767 --> 00:19:56,867
<b>I'm the best, right?</b>

296
00:19:57,367 --> 00:19:59,367
<b>Yes. Thank you.</b>

297
00:19:59,767 --> 00:20:01,867
<b>You don't look grateful at all.</b>

298
00:20:03,736 --> 00:20:05,837
<b>Thank you so much.</b>

299
00:20:06,037 --> 00:20:08,547
<b>Happy?
Can you feel my gratitude now?</b>

300
00:20:08,676 --> 00:20:10,877
<b>If you're really grateful,</b>

301
00:20:11,077 --> 00:20:13,017
<b>write me some coupons.</b>

302
00:20:13,117 --> 00:20:14,216
<b>What coupons?</b>

303
00:20:14,787 --> 00:20:16,087
<b>10 coupons to get a pass?</b>

304
00:20:17,317 --> 00:20:19,916
<b>Okay. I'll give you 20 coupons.</b>

305
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:23,456
<b>Really? Then, I get 20 free passes
when you want to scold me.</b>

306
00:20:23,456 --> 00:20:24,857
<b>You can't say anything later.</b>

307
00:20:24,857 --> 00:20:26,827
<b>Okay, I got it.</b>

308

<b>It's me, Report Jo!</b>

462
00:33:25,754 --> 00:33:26,793
<b>Reporter Jo?</b>

463
00:33:28,124 --> 00:33:29,994
<b>Has it been you all along?</b>

464
00:33:32,594 --> 00:33:35,434
<b>No, it's not like that.
This is my house!</b>

465
00:33:35,434 --> 00:33:39,203
<b>My house! This is my house.</b>

466
00:33:39,203 --> 00:33:40,744
<b>This is my house.</b>

467
00:33:41,244 --> 00:33:42,274
<b>This is your house?</b>

468
00:33:42,274 --> 00:33:45,643
<b>Yes. Jeong Hoon asked me to use it.
That's why I was away.</b>

469
00:33:46,374 --> 00:33:48,214
<b>Can you put that down?</b>

470
00:33:50,913 --> 00:33:53,084
<b>Were you the one
who sent those photos?</b>

471
00:33:53,084 --> 00:33:54,724
<b>What photos?</b>

472
00:33:58,893 --> 00:34:00,154
<b>I'm sorry I hit you.</b>

473
00:34:00,923 --> 00:34:04,293
<b>I thought you were the stalker.
What were you doing?</b>

474
00:34:04,293 --> 00:34:06,863
<b>I had to organize some stuff
in a hurry.</b>

475
00:34:06,863 --> 00:34:08,603
<b>What did you have to organize
so suddenly?</b>

476
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:11,304
<b>Stuff related to my girlfriend.</b>

477
00:34:17,314 --> 00:34:18,874
<b>She was cheating on me.</b>

478
00:34:18,874 --> 00:34:19,974
<b>"Cheating"?</b>

479
00:34:26,284 --> 00:34:28,024
<b>She's a wench!</b>

480
00:34:29,654 --> 00:34:32,154
<b>Don't you love the vibe here?</b>

481
00:34:32,154 --> 00:34:34,163
<b>Yes, it's nice.</b>

482
00:34:34,893 --> 00:34:37,334
<b>Since you can't drink alcohol,
just sip on your water.</b>

483
00:34:37,334 --> 00:34:40,363
<b>Ha Jin, can you drink
another glass of wine?</b>

484
00:34:40,363 --> 00:34:41,404
<b>I'd love to.</b>

485
00:34:42,263 --> 00:34:43,874
<b>You said you were going to treat me
to something delicious.</b>

486
00:34:43,874 --> 00:34:45,733
<b>Were you talking
about this wine bar?</b>

487
00:34:45,733 --> 00:34:48,344
<b>Their cheese is delicious. Try it.</b>

488
00:34:48,344 --> 00:34:50,073
<b>Or do you want me to treat you
to something tastier?</b>

489
00:34:51,073 --> 00:34:52,774
<b>Is something wrong?</b>

490
00:34:53,113 --> 00:34:54,443
<b>No. Why?</b>

491
00:34:54,443 --> 00:34:56,814
<b>You're not acting
like your usual self.</b>

492
00:34:56,844 --> 00:34:58,953
<b>Let's just say...</b>

493
00:34:58,953 --> 00:35:03,893
<b>I've finally become grateful
for the things around me.</b>

494
00:35:04,823 --> 00:35:07,163
<b>You'll know once you become my age.</b>

495
00:35:07,893 --> 00:35:08,923
<b>Excuse me.</b>

496
00:35:11,934 --> 00:35:13,064
<b>Hello?</b>

497
00:35:20,904 --> 00:35:22,043
<b>Let's get up.</b>

498
00:35:22,043 --> 00:35:23,543
<b>- What?
- Hurry.</b>

499
00:35:25,613 --> 00:35:28,384
<b>What? Are you going to the toilet?
It's over there.</b>

500
00:35:28,844 --> 00:35:29,944
<b>No, I'm not.</b>

501
00:35:31,113 --> 00:35:32,284
<b>It's over there.</b>

502
00:35:35,724 --> 00:35:37,853
<b>Now that I'm back, cheers!</b>

503
00:35:37,853 --> 00:35:38,853
<b>Cheers.</b>

504
00:35:46,694 --> 00:35:48,704
<b>What a ridiculous woman.</b>

505
00:35:48,704 --> 00:35:50,774
<b>And she slapped you?</b>

506
00:35:50,873 --> 00:35:53,274
<b>I knew she was an odd one
ever since you said...</b>

507
00:35:53,274 --> 00:35:54,303
<b>she couldn't finish
a single sushi set.</b>

508
00:35:55,173 --> 00:35:56,644
<b>Calm down and drink that.</b>

509
00:35:56,644 --> 00:35:58,813
<b>So what will you do?
Did you take your revenge?</b>

510
00:35:58,813 --> 00:36:00,384
<b>No, I couldn't do anything.</b>

511
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:02,743
<b>She chose him over me.
I was speechless.</b>

512
00:36:02,743 --> 00:36:06,214
<b>She wants a man
whom she can count on.</b>

513
00:36:06,214 --> 00:36:09,454
<b>Gosh, and what?
She can count on that guy?</b>

514
00:36:09,454 --> 00:36:11,094
<b>He's an MMA fighter.</b>

515
00:36:12,524 --> 00:36:13,623
<b>I see.</b>

516
00:36:13,923 --> 00:36:15,063
<b>Ha Kyung.</b>

517
00:36:15,363 --> 00:36:18,233
<b>Do I not look dependable?</b>

518
00:36:18,233 --> 00:36:19,363
<b>Do I look weak?</b>

519
00:36:19,363 --> 00:36:20,363
<b>Yes.</b>

520
00:36:23,003 --> 00:36:24,034
<b>I see.</b>

521
00:36:26,173 --> 00:36:28,274
<b>So what? Are you going
to sit there and do nothing?</b>

522
00:36:28,274 --> 00:36:30,003
<b>Then should I take my revenge?</b>

523
00:36:30,003 --> 00:36:31,113
<b>Of course.</b>

524
00:36:31,113 --> 00:36:33,714
<b>Strong men seem to be
her ideal type.</b>

525
00:36:33,714 --> 00:36:36,714
<b>Fighting isn't about strength.
It's about skills.</b>

526
00:36:36,714 --> 00:36:38,753
<b>What do you say?
Do you want my help?</b>

527
00:36:39,613 --> 00:36:40,753
<b>Your help?</b>

528
00:36:41,983 --> 00:36:43,454
<b>Do you not trust me?</b>

529
00:36:43,454 --> 00:36:45,753
<b>No, it's not like that.</b>

530
00:36:45,753 --> 00:36:47,863
<b>Sure, you can help me.</b>

531
00:36:48,163 --> 00:36:51,063
<b>You're so trustworthy. You sure are.</b>

532
00:36:51,534 --> 00:36:53,803
<b>Skills like this one?
This is amazing.</b>

533
00:36:53,803 --> 00:36:55,904
<b>You twisted my arm earlier as well.</b>

534
00:36:57,074 --> 00:36:58,603
<b>Come on, wait a minute.</b>

535
00:36:58,603 --> 00:37:00,474
<b>This was the arm you twisted.</b>

536
00:37:00,474 --> 00:37:02,303
<b>Wait. It hurts.</b>

537
00:37:02,444 --> 00:37:03,913
<b>We'll begin starting next week.</b>

538
00:37:04,413 --> 00:37:05,413
<b>What?</b>

539
00:37:06,144 --> 00:37:08,284
<b>I don't care.</b>

540
00:37:11,353 --> 00:37:14,154
<b>You keep saying okay
and wanting to hang up.</b>

541
00:37:14,154 --> 00:37:16,524
<b>But what are you okay about?</b>

542
00:37:16,524 --> 00:37:22,063
<b>I just miss you...</b>

543
00:37:22,063 --> 00:37:23,863
<b>so terribly.</b>

544
00:37:23,863 --> 00:37:27,034
<b>So hurry up and come here.</b>

545
00:37:27,034 --> 00:37:29,733
<b>He's very cute toward his wife.</b>

546
00:37:29,733 --> 00:37:31,673
<b>I don't know.</b>

547
00:37:32,034 --> 00:37:34,303
<b>If you don't come here,
I won't go home tonight.</b>

548
00:37:34,303 --> 00:37:36,944
<b>Jeong Hoon, call her over.</b>

549
00:37:36,944 --> 00:37:38,844
<b>She'll probably listen to you.</b>

550
00:37:38,844 --> 00:37:41,483
<b>You guys are always so close.</b>

551
00:37:42,644 --> 00:37:45,214
<b>Am I an outcast or what?</b>

552
00:37:45,214 --> 00:37:46,214
<b>It's me.</b>

553
00:37:46,683 --> 00:37:49,954
<b>Oh, you're almost here?
Please hurry.</b>

554
00:37:52,053 --> 00:37:54,563
<b>Are you close with his wife?</b>

555
00:37:59,063 --> 00:38:00,733
<b>You know her as well.</b>

556
00:38:01,264 --> 00:38:02,803
<b>I do?</b>

557
00:38:03,974 --> 00:38:05,274
<b>Is she a celebrity?</b>

558
00:38:10,844 --> 00:38:12,714
<b>- Director Choi.
- Hello.</b>

559
00:38:14,714 --> 00:38:17,043
<b>What kind of humiliation is this?</b>

560
00:38:17,043 --> 00:38:20,384
<b>Please wake up, Team Manager Kim!</b>

561

<b>It's my beautiful wife!</b>

<b>I'm truly sorry about this.</b>

<b>Get up right now.</b>

<b>and cause a scene?</b>

570

<b>Go home safely.</b>

584
00:39:28,353 --> 00:39:30,384

<b>Yes.</b>

<b>My car is parked
at the broadcasting station.</b>

<b>It's okay. It's not that far.</b>

592

<b>Let's take a walk.</b>

593

<b>I've never been here before.</b>

<b>It's empty and quiet.</b>

<b>I'm not sure, but I'm guessing
around the end of this month.</b>

598

<b>But I'm worried...</b>

599
00:40:11,094 --> 00:40:13,564
<b>because my news tutor seems
to have forgotten about me.</b>

<b>When are you free?
I'll help you.</b>

<b>Be careful.</b>

604

00:42:02,103 --> 00:42:03,743
<b>Why are you picking up her phone?</b>

618
00:42:03,743 --> 00:42:05,773
<b>She's filming at the moment.</b>

619
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:07,844
<b>Okay. I'll call back later.</b>

620
00:42:07,844 --> 00:42:09,143
<b>Wait.</b>

621
00:42:11,113 --> 00:42:14,653
<b>The filming just started,</b>

622
00:42:14,783 --> 00:42:16,523
<b>so it'll take some time.</b>

623
00:42:16,523 --> 00:42:19,123
<b>Can you tell me what this is about?</b>

624
00:42:19,393 --> 00:42:21,924
<b>I'm in front of your house

625
00:42:22,094 --> 00:42:24,334
<b>You're in front of our house?</b>

626
00:42:24,334 --> 00:42:26,893
<b>Tell me when she'll be done,
and I'll stop by then.</b>

627
00:42:27,863 --> 00:42:30,733
<b>I'm sorry, but she'll be filming
all night today.</b>

628
00:42:31,533 --> 00:42:34,574
<b>If you don't want to leave it there,
you can drop it off at the office.</b>

629
00:42:34,574 --> 00:42:35,873
<b>There's no need for that.</b>

630
00:42:36,204 --> 00:42:38,314
<b>Just tell her to call me
once she's done.</b>

631
00:42:38,314 --> 00:42:40,013
<b>It's okay if she's late.
I'll be waiting.</b>

632
00:42:40,013 --> 00:42:41,414
<b>All right.</b>

633
00:42:43,783 --> 00:42:45,783
<b>Don't hold your breath, you scumbag.</b>

634
00:42:46,283 --> 00:42:48,924
<b>What's his deal?
Why is he in front of the house?</b>

635
00:42:48,924 --> 00:42:51,554
<b>How dare she tell me what to do?</b>

636
00:43:02,533 --> 00:43:04,574
<b>Did I get a call?
You were talking to someone.</b>

637
00:43:04,574 --> 00:43:05,903
<b>Yes, Director Ji called.</b>

638
00:43:07,174 --> 00:43:08,304
<b>Why did he call?</b>

639
00:43:08,304 --> 00:43:09,444
<b>It's nothing.</b>

640
00:43:09,444 --> 00:43:12,414
<b>I told him that you were
busy filming, so don't worry.</b>

641
00:43:13,344 --> 00:43:14,344
<b>Okay.</b>

642
00:43:16,113 --> 00:43:17,883
<b>Let's spam his number.</b>

643
00:43:18,353 --> 00:43:20,013
<b>He'll call my number if it's urgent.</b>

644
00:43:21,653 --> 00:43:23,483
<b>It could've been him.</b>

645
00:43:24,853 --> 00:43:28,393
<b>He could've sneaked in and left
those photos and the letter.</b>

646
00:43:32,263 --> 00:43:35,533
<b>I'm bound to run
into both him and Chul again.</b>

647
00:43:35,533 --> 00:43:37,533
<b>I don't know how I can face them.</b>

648
00:43:37,533 --> 00:43:39,574
<b>You don't have to face them. Don't.</b>

649
00:43:39,574 --> 00:43:41,103
<b>Don't even answer their calls
for the time being.</b>

650
00:43:41,444 --> 00:43:42,503
<b>I blocked his number.</b>

651
00:43:48,344 --> 00:43:49,414
<b>Yes, Ms. Park.</b>

652
00:43:49,814 --> 00:43:51,814
<b>How's the place you're staying at?</b>

653
00:43:52,314 --> 00:43:54,523
<b>How about the security?
We can trust it, right?</b>

654
00:43:55,153 --> 00:43:57,153
<b>Yes. I'm so relieved to hear that.</b>

655
00:43:57,153 --> 00:43:59,324
<b>Yes. Okay.</b>

<b>Hey, Chul.</b>

659
00:44:05,294 --> 00:44:07,964
<b>I checked the schedule.
I'm with Se Min next month too.</b>

660
00:44:07,964 --> 00:44:09,434
<b>Does it mean I can't work
with Ha Jin anymore?</b>

661
00:44:09,434 --> 00:44:12,633
<b>My gosh, it's not that.
It's just for the time being.</b>

662
00:44:12,633 --> 00:44:14,033
<b>Did I do something wrong?</b>

663
00:44:14,033 --> 00:44:17,074
<b>It's not like I was bad at my job
or did anything wrong.</b>

664
00:44:17,074 --> 00:44:18,773
<b>Why am I getting kicked out?</b>

665
00:44:18,773 --> 00:44:21,584
<b>My gosh,
you're not getting kicked out.</b>

666
00:44:22,414 --> 00:44:24,914
<b>Chul, don't get so worked up.</b>

667
00:44:25,814 --> 00:44:27,414
<b>Ha Kyung told you
to kick me out, right?</b>

668
00:44:29,883 --> 00:44:31,353
<b>Are you suspecting me?</b>

669
00:44:32,094 --> 00:44:33,794
<b>That I'm Ha Jin's stalker?</b>

670
00:44:34,123 --> 00:44:35,964
<b>- You...
- How could you?</b>

671
00:44:36,794 --> 00:44:38,493
<b>It's not me. Okay?</b>

672
00:44:39,194 --> 00:44:40,964
<b>It's not me!</b>

673
00:45:39,794 --> 00:45:41,094

<b>Get out.</b>

678
00:46:32,373 --> 00:46:35,483
<b>You sent Soo Chang's memory card
to get it fixed. Is it done yet?</b>

679
00:46:35,684 --> 00:46:37,814
<b>Not yet. After deleting the photos,</b>

680
00:46:37,814 --> 00:46:40,253
<b>he saved other files
in the same memory card.</b>

<b>How much of it did they recover?</b>

685
00:46:49,094 --> 00:46:50,863
<b>I brought everything
they recovered so far.</b>

686
00:46:50,863 --> 00:46:52,763
<b>They recovered about 80 percent.</b>

687

<b>What?
These are all photos of Ha Jin.</b>
