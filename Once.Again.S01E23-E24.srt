2

<b>Mom.</b>

3

<b>Mom.</b>

4
00:00:16,429 --> 00:00:17,560
<b>Oh my goodness.</b>

5
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:20,330
<b>What hasn't Na Hee told me?</b>

6
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:22,169
<b>You see...</b>

7
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:24,910
<b>Mom, what's this?</b>

8
00:00:25,339 --> 00:00:26,440
<b>Is this sikhye?</b>

9
00:00:26,739 --> 00:00:28,780
<b>It must be for Joon Seon's friends.
Let me.</b>

10

<b>Stop changing the subject.</b>

11
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:33,780
<b>What hasn't Na Hee told me?
Tell me right now.</b>

12
00:00:44,289 --> 00:00:45,759
<b>What is it?</b>

13
00:00:46,429 --> 00:00:49,500
<b>What's going on

14

15

<b>Na Hee suggested that
we throw you a surprise party.</b>

19
00:01:05,409 --> 00:01:07,350
<b>We had a feast for Dad today,</b>

20

to not do anything for you.</b>

21
00:01:11,149 --> 00:01:14,189
<b>It was supposed to be a secret,
but you kind of ruined it.</b>

22
00:01:14,349 --> 00:01:15,459
<b>Right?</b>

23
00:01:15,459 --> 00:01:18,290
<b>That's right. A surprise party.</b>

24
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:21,459
<b>Unbelievable.</b>

25
00:01:22,129 --> 00:01:25,370
<b>And here I thought
something serious had happened.</b>

26
00:01:25,629 --> 00:01:28,670
<b>But there's no need
for a birthday party.</b>

27
00:01:28,939 --> 00:01:31,909
<b>I'm good with a family dinner.</b>

28
00:01:31,909 --> 00:01:35,040

Still, you ruined the surprise.</b>

29
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:38,879
<b>Anyway, guys.
That's the end of that, okay?</b>

30
00:01:41,219 --> 00:01:43,150

31

<b>Joon Seon, you take these inside.</b>

32
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:48,219

36
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:03,769
<b>You've got to be kidding me.</b>

37
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,879
<b>It was exhausting, wasn't it?
I hope you can understand though.</b>

38

I had a blast too.</b>

40

41

42

44
00:02:28,229 --> 00:02:30,759
<b>It's delicious, Mother.
It's perfect.</b>

45

<b>Na Hee, have a seat.
I'll get you some sikhye.</b>

50

- Okay, sure.</b>

<b>Thank you for everything, Mother.</b>

55
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:55,319
<b>We'll get going then.
You don't have to see us out.</b>

56

<b>Okay, sure. Get going then.
Don't skip your meals, okay?</b>

57

- Don't mention it.</b>

59
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,300
<b>Did they argue?</b>

60
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:09,439
<b>I doubt it.
They seemed fine earlier.</b>

61

<b>Of course they're exhausted.</b>

62

<b>You invited them just to
brag about them to people.</b>

63

<b>I couldn't look Gyu Jin

66
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:32,030
<b>What was that?
Did something happen?</b>

67
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,659
<b>Can you just get the car?</b>

68
00:03:33,659 --> 00:03:35,629

<b>They won't spill the beans
any time soon.</b>

77

<b>I told them to give me some time
and that I'd tell our parents.</b>

<b>How on earth did they find out?</b>

79

00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:19,709
<b>A husband and wife are on it
and the wife keeps smashing him.</b>

155
00:08:19,709 --> 00:08:20,850
<b>- Really?
- Yes.</b>

156
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:23,750
<b>Wait, those two?</b>

157
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:30,360
<b>So it's true that
TV programs are all staged.</b>

158
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,360
<b>Why? Do you know them?
What do you know?</b>

159
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,539
<b>This is deception.
You're ignoring us...</b>

160
00:08:44,539 --> 00:08:46,809
<b>and fooling Mom and Dad
who care so much about you.</b>

161
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:56,179
<b>Dr. Song, the doctor taking over
Yo Han's case is here.</b>

162
00:08:56,179 --> 00:08:57,980
<b>Sure. I'll see him right now.</b>

163
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:04,860
<b>Jeong Rok?</b>

164
00:09:05,059 --> 00:09:06,690
<b>I put together his status report...</b>

165
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:08,899
<b>just in case
there are any complications.</b>

166
00:09:10,429 --> 00:09:13,330
<b>It's a thorough report.
I expected no less.</b>

167
00:09:14,269 --> 00:09:16,240
<b>Don't worry though.
I got this covered.</b>

168
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,240
<b>Sure.</b>

169
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:28,009
<b>Na Hee, I was actually
on my way to you.</b>

170
00:09:28,009 --> 00:09:29,450
<b>We'll talk later.</b>

171
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:33,549
<b>Can we get this over with right now?</b>

172
00:09:33,889 --> 00:09:36,190
<b>I'd like to get scolded
and put this behind me.</b>

173
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:39,860
<b>We'll talk later, brother-in-law.</b>

174
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:45,570
<b>Brother-in-law?
You must be Gyu Jin's brother.</b>

175
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:46,730
<b>Sorry?</b>

176
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:52,340
<b>He's a dentist here and he graduated
from Sejin University.</b>

177
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:54,009
<b>I'm sure you know Lee Jeong Rok.</b>

178
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:56,279
<b>Mr. Lee!</b>

179
00:09:57,009 --> 00:09:59,750
<b>I heard a lot about you.
This is an honor.</b>

180
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:02,419
<b>Dentistry students know me too?</b>

181
00:10:02,419 --> 00:10:04,279
<b>Of course, Mr. Lee.</b>

182
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:05,919
<b>So many are working
as doctors these days...</b>

183
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:07,690
<b>thanks to your sacred notes.</b>

184
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:10,120
<b>You saved the lives of many.</b>

185
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,960
<b>Well, so I heard.</b>

186
00:10:14,629 --> 00:10:16,860
<b>You don't seem
a lot like Gyu Jin though.</b>

187
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:21,070
<b>I took after our father
while he took after our mother.</b>

188
00:10:21,669 --> 00:10:25,269
<b>As you can see,
my genetics are better...</b>

189
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:29,740
<b>I'll see you around then.
It was nice meeting you.</b>

190
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:30,980
<b>Sure thing.</b>

191
00:10:34,179 --> 00:10:36,019
<b>He's an odd one too, isn't he?</b>

192
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,620
<b>His personality doesn't seem
like Gyu Jin's either.</b>

193
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:43,960
<b>Jeong Rok? My gosh.
What brings you by?</b>

194
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:47,529
<b>I'm here to take over the care
for Na Hee's osteosarcoma patient.</b>

195
00:10:47,629 --> 00:10:50,559
<b>Whoever it was got lucky then.</b>

196
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:51,659
<b>Just a second.</b>

197
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:53,330
<b>Na Hee, are you free right now?</b>

198
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,970
<b>Maybe later.
The transition isn't over yet.</b>

199
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:57,570
<b>I still need to get him
the other materials.</b>

200
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,470
<b>Would you like to meet Yo Han first?</b>

201
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:02,480
<b>Why not? I'll see you around then.</b>

202
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,710
<b>Sure thing.</b>

203
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:10,179
<b>I was hoping to set up a plan,</b>

204
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:14,149
<b>but I guess I'm the only one
who thinks of this as an emergency.</b>

205
00:11:17,659 --> 00:11:19,830
<b>Aren't they being
too friendly though?</b>

206
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:24,259
<b>Darn it.</b>

207
00:11:31,299 --> 00:11:34,110
<b>Joon Seon,
your noodles will turn to mush.</b>

208
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:37,179
<b>Isn't the dish good enough?</b>

209
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:42,720
<b>This is why you should've
ordered from the usual place.</b>

210
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,019
<b>Jajangmyeon is pretty much the same,</b>

211
00:11:45,019 --> 00:11:46,620
<b>so why would you bother him...</b>

212
00:11:46,649 --> 00:11:47,990
<b>by ordering one
that's 50 cents more expensive?</b>

213
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:50,860
<b>You told me to order from here
because they served chunkier meat.</b>

214
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:53,759
<b>Guys, cut it out.
I'll eat mine, so stop arguing.</b>

215
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:01,570
<b>(Hyun Gyung)</b>

216
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:04,870
<b>Hi, Hyun Gyung.</b>

217
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:07,970
<b>Where are you? At the office?
Could we meet?</b>

218
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:10,980
<b>Yes, of course. Where are you?</b>

219
00:12:16,679 --> 00:12:19,549
<b>I hope I didn't
make you wait too long.</b>

220
00:12:19,649 --> 00:12:22,559
<b>I didn't.
You didn't have to run over here.</b>

221
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:25,330
<b>I wasn't running.
I only walked at a fast pace.</b>

222
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:29,799
<b>Here.</b>

223
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,370
<b>- What's this?
- A dress shirt for your dad.</b>

224
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:34,230
<b>I didn't know if I should buy this,</b>

225
00:12:34,929 --> 00:12:38,070
<b>but it seemed rude to ignore
his birthday after knowing about it.</b>

226
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:41,840
<b>Please tell him that
I wish him a happy birthday.</b>

227
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,379
<b>This wasn't necessary, you know.</b>

228
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:47,509
<b>Gosh, it's expensive too.
It's way better than what I got him.</b>

229
00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:49,379
<b>You shouldn't have spent so much...</b>

230
00:12:49,419 --> 00:12:51,250
<b>especially when
you don't spend any on yourself.</b>

231
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:52,750
<b>That's not enough
to show my gratitude though.</b>

232
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:57,519
<b>You know how I owe
your parents a lot.</b>

233
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:03,299
<b>I'll get going then.
Head back inside.</b>

234
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:04,860
<b>Hyun Gyung, wait.</b>

235
00:13:05,899 --> 00:13:09,240
<b>How about we get some lunch?
I haven't eaten yet.</b>

236
00:13:12,309 --> 00:13:15,169
<b>I haven't had jajangmyeon
in a while.</b>

237
00:13:16,909 --> 00:13:17,980
<b>Gosh, it looks good.</b>

238
00:13:20,809 --> 00:13:22,419
<b>This place is famous for
its old-fashioned jajangmyeon.</b>

239
00:13:22,419 --> 00:13:23,519
<b>Really?</b>

240
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:29,360
<b>It's a work of art.</b>

241
00:13:33,629 --> 00:13:37,159
<b>The kimchi is delicious too.
That's what I call skill.</b>

242
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,669
<b>Ma'am, what kind of fish sauce
did you make the kimchi with?</b>

243
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,769
<b>We buy our kimchi from China.</b>

244
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:49,779
<b>No wonder I could taste
the flavors of China.</b>

245
00:13:49,779 --> 00:13:52,110
<b>They know how to make
good kimchi these days too.</b>

246
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,179
<b>So tell me. What's going on?</b>

247
00:13:57,179 --> 00:13:58,549
<b>What do you mean?</b>

248
00:13:59,149 --> 00:14:02,559
<b>There's something on your mind.
It's why you asked me to lunch.</b>

249
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:06,159
<b>As always, I can never fool you.</b>

250
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,230
<b>It's about Na Hee.</b>

251
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,200
<b>What about her?</b>

252
00:14:13,029 --> 00:14:16,500
<b>That brat got divorced.
It happened over a month ago.</b>

253
00:14:17,169 --> 00:14:20,210
<b>Unbelievable, right?
That's 4 out of 4 now.</b>

254
00:14:20,509 --> 00:14:22,080
<b>It should be in
the Guinness World Records.</b>

255
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,409
<b>What about your parents?</b>

256
00:14:24,809 --> 00:14:25,850
<b>Are they all right?</b>

257
00:14:26,379 --> 00:14:27,610
<b>They don't know yet.</b>

258
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:30,149
<b>It's been eating me up inside.</b>

259
00:14:30,679 --> 00:14:32,820
<b>Without knowing anything,</b>

260
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,750
<b>Mom looks after them
as if they're royalty.</b>

261
00:14:35,049 --> 00:14:36,559
<b>My gosh.</b>

262
00:14:37,289 --> 00:14:40,659
<b>I was so upset
that I yelled at Na Hee.</b>

263
00:14:41,029 --> 00:14:42,929
<b>And it's still weighing on my mind.</b>

264
00:14:42,929 --> 00:14:45,870
<b>What does she say?
Is it really over?</b>

265
00:14:46,629 --> 00:14:48,299
<b>Did she say there's no turning back?</b>

266
00:14:48,899 --> 00:14:49,970
<b>I don't know.</b>

267
00:14:50,539 --> 00:14:51,769
<b>You know what she's like.</b>

268
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:53,509
<b>She always leaves people speechless.</b>

269
00:14:53,509 --> 00:14:56,539
<b>What about Gyu Jin?
Did you talk to him?</b>

270
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:02,850
<b>If Mother and Father don't know,
you should probably talk to him.</b>

271
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:07,120
<b>I know your meddling can't
make them change their mind,</b>

272
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,590
<b>but you're
her older brother after all.</b>

273
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:11,789
<b>I know.</b>

274
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:14,789
<b>I'm her older brother, right?</b>

275
00:15:21,529 --> 00:15:23,169
<b>What are you doing here
at this hour?</b>

276
00:15:23,169 --> 00:15:25,370
<b>- What about training?
- I need to talk to you.</b>

277
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:27,370
<b>This is Hyun Gyung's gift for Dad.</b>

278
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:29,009
<b>What is it?</b>

279
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:32,610
<b>Oh, it's a dress shirt.</b>

280
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:34,049
<b>It's pretty.</b>

281
00:15:34,049 --> 00:15:35,850
<b>She's got a good sense of fashion.</b>

282
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:38,450
<b>That's not important. About Na Hee.</b>

283
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:42,159
<b>Now that they know we know,
we should have a serious talk.</b>

284
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:43,690
<b>I think so.</b>

285
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:46,129
<b>I've been feeling uncomfortable.</b>

286
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:48,029
<b>And I wonder how Na Hee feels.</b>

287
00:15:48,799 --> 00:15:51,730
<b>Let's do this, Ga Hee.
You should talk to Na Hee.</b>

288
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:53,830
<b>- And I'll meet Gyu Jin.
- And?</b>

289
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:58,039
<b>We have a heart-to-heart talk
and try to convince them.</b>

290
00:15:58,039 --> 00:15:59,769
<b>All men and women in the world
are all the same.</b>

291
00:15:59,769 --> 00:16:03,039
<b>They have to give it a second
thought before it's too late.</b>

292
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:07,509
<b>I don't know if it will work,
but we have to give it one last try.</b>

293
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:11,580
<b>Ga Hee, we have a grave mission
to carry out.</b>

294
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:15,090
<b>You and I have to keep
our family happy.</b>

295
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:16,590
<b>Can you do that?</b>

296
00:16:16,789 --> 00:16:17,919
<b>Okay.</b>

297
00:16:18,259 --> 00:16:19,330
<b>Okay.</b>

298
00:16:21,889 --> 00:16:22,929
<b>Let's do this.</b>

299
00:16:23,299 --> 00:16:24,399
<b>Got it.</b>

300
00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:26,429
<b>Gosh, again?</b>

301
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,070
<b>I'm not sure I can take this.</b>

302
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:32,470
<b>Gosh, it's no big deal.
You don't have to feel pressured.</b>

303
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:37,139
<b>Like I said before,
this is like a drop in the ocean.</b>

304
00:16:37,139 --> 00:16:38,980
<b>Please feel free to eat it.</b>

305
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:40,909
<b>Still, this is just...</b>

306
00:16:41,009 --> 00:16:42,919
<b>Just take it, Cho Yeon.</b>

307
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:45,120
<b>I believe Mr. Yang is doing this
for a good reason.</b>

308
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,549
<b>She's right. There's no such thing
as a free lunch.</b>

309
00:16:47,549 --> 00:16:49,259
<b>What's good for the goose
is good for the gander.</b>

310
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:51,759
<b>It's just mutually beneficial.</b>

311
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:52,960
<b>That's how things work.</b>

312
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,360
<b>Don't you think so, Mr. Yang?</b>

313
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:56,759
<b>Well... I guess you're right.</b>

314
00:16:57,259 --> 00:17:00,269
<b>If you still feel bad,
you can give me some kimbap.</b>

315
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:03,240
<b>I don't think we can't call it even
with some kimbap.</b>

316
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,840
<b>Please wait a moment then.</b>

317
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,639
<b>I can wait all day.</b>

318
00:17:06,639 --> 00:17:08,570
<b>Take your time.</b>

319
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:09,940
<b>Ju Ri, get him some soda.</b>

320
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:11,240
<b>- Okay.
- Let me do it.</b>

321
00:17:12,509 --> 00:17:14,910
<b>- Please have a seat here.
- Okay.</b>

322
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:16,349
<b>Here.</b>

323
00:17:18,279 --> 00:17:19,319
<b>Mr. Yang.</b>

324
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:21,450
<b>Please have some soda.</b>

325
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:22,759
<b>Okay.</b>

326
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,789
<b>Let me take care of this.</b>

327
00:17:24,789 --> 00:17:26,230
<b>- I'll do this.
- No, I will.</b>

328
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:28,259
<b>Look. He's looking at me.</b>

329
00:17:29,559 --> 00:17:32,000
<b>- The phone is turned off.
- He didn't come to the meeting.</b>

330
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,529
<b>And I just can't reach him.
Where is he?</b>

331
00:17:35,099 --> 00:17:38,339
<b>Is he indulged in gambling
or something?</b>

332
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:40,839
<b>See you, Mr. Yang.</b>

333
00:17:40,839 --> 00:17:42,210
<b>Bye.</b>

334
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:44,640
<b>- Please come again.
- Of course I will.</b>

335
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,380
<b>I'll come again. See you.</b>

336
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:48,410
<b>Bye.</b>

337
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:53,220
<b>Hey.</b>

338
00:17:54,619 --> 00:17:55,690
<b>Hey!</b>

339
00:17:59,789 --> 00:18:00,960
<b>Stop drooling.</b>

340
00:18:03,059 --> 00:18:06,329
<b>You seem to like
their kimbap very much.</b>

341
00:18:06,529 --> 00:18:07,970
<b>My gosh.</b>

342
00:18:12,309 --> 00:18:13,339
<b>Thank you.</b>

343
00:18:13,809 --> 00:18:16,779
<b>Mr. Yang, why do you keep buying
their kimbap when it's not good?</b>

344
00:18:16,779 --> 00:18:18,009
<b>I'm so sick of it.</b>

345
00:18:18,109 --> 00:18:20,910
<b>You punk. I bought it for you.</b>

346
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:22,920
<b>Did you sharpen the knives?</b>

347
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:25,019
<b>If you haven't,
go ahead and sharpen them right now.</b>

348
00:18:25,589 --> 00:18:26,750
<b>I was going to.</b>

349
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:33,160
<b>Why? What did I do?</b>

350
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:38,559
<b>Hey, I know what's going on.
Just come clean.</b>

351
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:41,299
<b>It's clean. Happy now?</b>

352
00:18:41,769 --> 00:18:44,539
<b>Why is it so hot today?</b>

353
00:18:44,539 --> 00:18:46,769
<b>It's a scorcher.</b>

354
00:18:46,769 --> 00:18:49,039
<b>Hey, you have a fever, right?</b>

355
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:51,079
<b>It's spring fever.</b>

356
00:18:52,009 --> 00:18:54,509
<b>That's right. Are you happy now?</b>

357
00:18:54,579 --> 00:18:57,019
<b>I'm a single man.
What's the big deal?</b>

358
00:18:57,019 --> 00:19:00,190
<b>It is a big deal. It's huge.</b>

359
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:03,490
<b>Hey, when did it start?
How did it happen?</b>

360
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:04,759
<b>I don't know.</b>

361
00:19:04,759 --> 00:19:06,759
<b>There's no reason for love.</b>

362
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:08,190
<b>What? Love?</b>

363
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:12,299
<b>Did you say love?
Gosh, this is crazy.</b>

364
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,029
<b>Of course it's love.
Love isn't just for young people.</b>

365
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:18,799
<b>My heart is pounding hard,
and I feel so alive.</b>

366
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:20,809
<b>Can't you see that
my color has improved?</b>

367
00:19:20,809 --> 00:19:23,609
<b>I can feel my blood
circulating these days.</b>

368
00:19:23,779 --> 00:19:25,980
<b>You seem quite excited.</b>

369
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:27,980
<b>Fine. That's good.</b>

370
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:30,380
<b>So which one is it?
The taller one or the shorter one?</b>

371
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:32,250
<b>The round and chubby one.</b>

372
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:34,390
<b>Round and chubby?</b>

373
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:36,289
<b>None of them are round and chubby...</b>

374
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:40,789
<b>Hang on. Is it that...</b>

375
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:43,130
<b>Right. It's Cho Yeon.</b>

376
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:44,829
<b>Cho Yeon?</b>

377
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,769
<b>The leader?</b>

378
00:19:47,099 --> 00:19:49,769
<b>The round and chubby one
who smiles a lot?</b>

379
00:19:49,769 --> 00:19:53,410
<b>Right. She's got a fatal charm.</b>

380
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:56,609
<b>Sometimes she's cool,
and sometimes she's sexy.</b>

381
00:19:56,809 --> 00:19:59,079
<b>She even has a dimple here.</b>

382
00:19:59,079 --> 00:20:01,910
<b>It's really adorable.</b>

383
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:07,589
<b>My gosh. You must've lost your mind.</b>

384
00:20:08,589 --> 00:20:10,019
<b>What's wrong about my Cho Yeon?</b>

385
00:20:10,019 --> 00:20:11,460
<b>My Cho Yeon?</b>

386
00:20:11,619 --> 00:20:14,160
<b>Hey, do you not know
about her temper?</b>

387
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:17,359
<b>She even singlehandedly took on
all the ladies from the market.</b>

388
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:19,599
<b>And do you still like her?</b>

389
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:21,869
<b>Yes. I like the braveness.</b>

390
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:24,200
<b>I like charismatic girls.</b>

391
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,170
<b>Hang on.
I just don't think this is right.</b>

392
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:29,980
<b>You'd better think again.</b>

393
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:32,750
<b>If things go wrong with her,
you'll be in big trouble.</b>

394
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:35,210
<b>I don't know. I don't care.
the bus has left already.</b>

395
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:37,779
<b>Once I make up my mind,
I just go for it.</b>

396
00:20:37,779 --> 00:20:41,190
<b>I just give away my love
until she gets sick of it.</b>

397
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:44,460
<b>That's a man's love.
Don't you think so?</b>

398
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:46,089
<b>Don't be silly.</b>

399
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:50,099
<b>Look at you.
You totally fell for her.</b>

400
00:20:50,099 --> 00:20:51,500
<b>What should I do with you?</b>

401
00:20:51,799 --> 00:20:53,170
<b>My gosh.</b>

402
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:55,170
<b>Hey.</b>

403
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,339
<b>Hey!</b>

404
00:20:58,740 --> 00:20:59,839
<b>Oh, no.</b>

405
00:21:01,769 --> 00:21:04,240
<b>I made 20 rolls of kimbap today,</b>

406
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,779
<b>and they sold right away.</b>

407
00:21:05,779 --> 00:21:08,410
<b>We need regulars
to run a restaurant in a market.</b>

408
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:12,619
<b>Mr. Yang from the butchers
frequents our restaurant too.</b>

409
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:16,259
<b>Cho Yeon,
that's not because of your kimbap.</b>

410
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:19,059
<b>You should know that
he comes to see me.</b>

411
00:21:19,059 --> 00:21:20,430
<b>What are you talking about?</b>

412
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:23,029
<b>He comes here because of me.</b>

413
00:21:23,029 --> 00:21:24,500
<b>I could feel it today.</b>

414
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,400
<b>Don't be silly.
You're making a fuss again.</b>

415
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:30,369
<b>You said Mr. Hong
from the gas station liked you,</b>

416
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,970
<b>- but he didn't.
- Yes, he did.</b>

417
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:35,839
<b>Then why do you think
he visited our bar all the time?</b>

418
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:37,210
<b>Do you think it was because of you?</b>

419
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:38,609
<b>Of course.</b>

420
00:21:38,609 --> 00:21:40,549
<b>He ordered yellow peach
when you served him,</b>

421
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:41,910
<b>but he ordered assorted fruit
when I did.</b>

422
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:43,019
<b>It can't be you.</b>

423
00:21:43,019 --> 00:21:46,650
<b>But he ordered a whiskey.</b>

424
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,450
<b>Did you have any customers
who ordered whiskey?</b>

425
00:21:48,519 --> 00:21:50,859
<b>Hey, that's enough.</b>

426
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:52,990
<b>It doesn't matter whom he likes.</b>

427
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:54,359
<b>Do you like Mr. Yang?</b>

428
00:21:54,359 --> 00:21:55,529
<b>- Are you crazy?
- Gosh, no.</b>

429
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:59,299
<b>Stop the useless squabble
and cook some more rice.</b>

430
00:21:59,299 --> 00:22:02,069
<b>- Ga Yeon, make some egg garnish.
- Okay.</b>

431
00:22:02,069 --> 00:22:04,200
<b>I'll go buy some carrots.</b>

432
00:22:04,269 --> 00:22:06,039
<b>Cho Yeon, are you going
to the old lady again?</b>

433
00:22:06,039 --> 00:22:07,769
<b>- Yes.
- We have to throw away...</b>

434
00:22:07,769 --> 00:22:09,240
<b>half of what you buy from her.</b>

435
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:11,680
<b>Can't you go to
the grocery store over there?</b>

436
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:14,279
<b>I won't tell you to prepare them,
so just do as I say.</b>

437
00:22:14,279 --> 00:22:15,309
<b>See you.</b>

438
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:20,650
<b>- My gosh, what's happening?
- What's the matter?</b>

439
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:23,220
<b>- My goodness.
- Are you all right?</b>

440
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:25,259
<b>- What happened?
- Call 911.</b>

441
00:22:25,589 --> 00:22:27,559
<b>Ma'am. Ma'am!</b>

442
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:30,559
<b>Ma'am. What's wrong?</b>

443
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:33,670
<b>What's wrong, Ma'am?
What's with her?</b>

444
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,730
<b>It's so cold. Call 911.</b>

445
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:38,140
<b>- What do we do?
- Call 911 now.</b>

446
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:39,910
<b>The ambulance can't
come into the alley.</b>

447
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:41,609
<b>We should take a taxi
on the main street.</b>

448
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,940
<b>Carry her on your back.</b>

449
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:45,849
<b>I strained my back,
so I can't carry her.</b>

450
00:22:45,849 --> 00:22:47,049
<b>My goodness.</b>

451
00:22:47,049 --> 00:22:49,009
<b>- Help me carry her on my back.
- You're a man.</b>

452
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:51,420
<b>Ma'am, pull yourself together.</b>

453
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,359
<b>Move over. Clear the way.</b>

454
00:22:58,289 --> 00:22:59,490
<b>My goodness.</b>

455
00:23:01,589 --> 00:23:02,799
<b>Move over.</b>

456
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:17,940
<b>Is it because you're young?
You have such quick hands.</b>

457
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:20,279
<b>You fold 2 boxes while we do only 1.</b>

458
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:22,650
<b>I know. I'm grateful for your help,</b>

459
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:25,049
<b>but I'm not sure
if I can let you work like this.</b>

460
00:23:25,049 --> 00:23:27,450
<b>My husband wouldn't like it.</b>

461
00:23:27,549 --> 00:23:30,759
<b>It's okay.
This is good enough rest for me.</b>

462
00:23:31,519 --> 00:23:34,059
<b>How are you doing
with the guys at the rooftop house?</b>

463
00:23:34,059 --> 00:23:35,930
<b>It's good. They seem nice.</b>

464
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:37,359
<b>And they are fun.</b>

465
00:23:37,359 --> 00:23:39,869
<b>If they give you a hard time,
just tell Mr. Song.</b>

466
00:23:39,869 --> 00:23:42,430
<b>You belong to the house owner,
and they belong to his dependent.</b>

467
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:44,839
<b>You've got more power.
Don't you think so, Ok Boon?</b>

468
00:23:44,839 --> 00:23:46,970
<b>How could you call your nephew
a dependent?</b>

469
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:49,339
<b>He's a tenant who pays rent.</b>

470
00:23:49,339 --> 00:23:52,279
<b>I see. I made a slip again.</b>

471
00:23:52,279 --> 00:23:54,410
<b>I'm so sorry, ma'am.</b>

472
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:57,220
<b>Hello.</b>

473
00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:00,920
<b>I'm here to have some of Ok Boon's
cereal smoothie.</b>

474
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:03,059
<b>Hello. It's been a long time.</b>

475
00:24:03,059 --> 00:24:04,490
<b>It's so good to see you.</b>

476
00:24:06,589 --> 00:24:09,559
<b>I've been busy
with things these days.</b>

477
00:24:11,299 --> 00:24:14,430
<b>Ms. Ok Ja, if you're not too busy,
will you make me a smoothie?</b>

478
00:24:14,529 --> 00:24:17,000
<b>Gosh, you're ridiculous.</b>

479
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:19,000
<b>It's not like
you left your smoothie with us.</b>

480
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,170
<b>How brazen you are.</b>

481
00:24:22,309 --> 00:24:23,440
<b>Hey.</b>

482
00:24:23,579 --> 00:24:24,609
<b>Mr. Song.</b>

483
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:26,849
<b>Mr. Song, something bad happened.</b>

484
00:24:26,849 --> 00:24:30,849
<b>The old lady who sells vegetables
just passed out.</b>

485
00:24:30,849 --> 00:24:33,420
<b>What? Why? What happened?</b>

486
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:34,990
<b>I don't know.</b>

487
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:38,319
<b>But the kimbap lady
put her on her back,</b>

488
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:40,460
<b>and took her in a taxi
to a hospital.</b>

489
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:42,329
<b>- Cho Yeon?
- Oh, dear.</b>

490
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,460
<b>Chi Su, is your car parked here?</b>

491
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:46,769
<b>Yes, yes. Let's take my car.</b>

492
00:24:46,769 --> 00:24:48,869
<b>Call me when you're there, okay?</b>

493
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,269
<b>The old woman has no kids
and lives alone.</b>

494
00:24:52,809 --> 00:24:56,539
<b>I know. My heart is still pounding.</b>

495
00:24:57,339 --> 00:25:00,549
<b>I made it nice and thick
so you'll choke on...</b>

496
00:25:02,619 --> 00:25:05,519
<b>Where did he get to? Did he leave?</b>

497
00:25:07,549 --> 00:25:09,960
<b>They're over there. That way.</b>

498
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:13,589
<b>- Cho Yeon.
- Hello.</b>

499
00:25:13,589 --> 00:25:15,559
<b>What did they say? Is she okay?</b>

500
00:25:15,559 --> 00:25:17,960
<b>I don't know.
They ran all the tests they needed,</b>

501
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,470
<b>but the results aren't out yet.</b>

502
00:25:20,369 --> 00:25:21,829
<b>Who is Ms. Park Jeong Ran's
guardian?</b>

503
00:25:21,829 --> 00:25:23,240
<b>- Me.
- That's me.</b>

504
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:26,940
<b>She doesn't have any family.</b>

505
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:28,369
<b>We work together.</b>

506
00:25:28,369 --> 00:25:31,480
<b>Oh, I see.
Based on the test results,</b>

507
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:34,849
<b>she has postural hypotension
and malnutrition.</b>

508
00:25:34,849 --> 00:25:38,650
<b>She's very old
and must be admitted for a few days.</b>

509
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:40,220
<b>Malnutrition?</b>

510
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:52,099
<b>She managed to
fall asleep right away.</b>

511
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:54,930
<b>Is it because of
the supplements she's getting?</b>

512
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:59,240
<b>It's a relief.
The color in her face is returning.</b>

513
00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:01,569
<b>Thank you, Cho Yeon.</b>

514
00:26:02,069 --> 00:26:05,579
<b>She must've been heavy.
How did you manage to carry her?</b>

515
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:08,779
<b>She wasn't heavy.
She was as light as a feather.</b>

516
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:13,019
<b>How is there still malnutrition
in this day and age?</b>

517
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:16,190
<b>She should eat decently.</b>

518
00:26:17,259 --> 00:26:19,730
<b>We hired a carer to look after her,</b>

519
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:22,490
<b>and she must rest,
so let's get back.</b>

520
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:23,930
<b>Let's leave for now.</b>

521
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:25,660
<b>- Yes.
- Let's go.</b>

522
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:34,069
<b>Hello.</b>

523
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:38,710
<b>Hey, what...</b>

524
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:41,950
<b>Are you free this evening?</b>

525
00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:44,049
<b>Let's meet without Na Hee knowing.</b>

526
00:26:46,849 --> 00:26:47,890
<b>(Ga Hee)</b>

527
00:26:49,019 --> 00:26:50,660
<b>- What?
- I'll be brief.</b>

528
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:52,359
<b>See me after work.</b>

529
00:26:59,359 --> 00:27:01,099
<b>Gyu Jin, over here.</b>

530
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:02,900
<b>Hello.</b>

531
00:27:11,609 --> 00:27:13,779
<b>You must eat as well.</b>

532
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:15,049
<b>It's fine.</b>

533
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,519
<b>- I'll cook...
- No, no.</b>

534
00:27:18,519 --> 00:27:20,390
<b>This is what my energy is good for.</b>

535
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:25,160
<b>Were you surprised that
I called you over?</b>

536
00:27:25,819 --> 00:27:27,059
<b>Not really.</b>

537
00:27:28,329 --> 00:27:30,960
<b>I'm sorry. I have nothing to say.</b>

538
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:37,200
<b>You're right. To be honest,</b>

539
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,500
<b>I couldn't believe it
when I first heard.</b>

540
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,640
<b>And I was angry.</b>

541
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:41,910
<b>How little did you think of us,</b>

542
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:44,079
<b>that you'd do that and not say...</b>

543
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:45,940
<b>No, I don't think little of you.</b>

544
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:49,880
<b>I know that.
I know what you're usually like.</b>

545
00:27:51,819 --> 00:27:55,750
<b>Gyu Jin. Let's talk, man-to-man.</b>

546
00:27:57,589 --> 00:28:01,130
<b>Can you really not
make it work with Na Hee?</b>

547
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,329
<b>Gosh, Joon Seon...</b>

548
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:06,369
<b>Yes, I know.</b>

549
00:28:06,869 --> 00:28:10,170
<b>Living with Na Hee
is not an easy feat.</b>

550
00:28:10,299 --> 00:28:12,809
<b>She's fussy
and smacks you around with words.</b>

551
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:18,440
<b>To be honest, you deserve praise
for living with her so far.</b>

552
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:21,809
<b>No. Na Hee put up with a lot too.</b>

553
00:28:21,809 --> 00:28:25,750
<b>No, no. I know you.
You know I do.</b>

554
00:28:27,549 --> 00:28:28,650
<b>But the thing is,</b>

555
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:32,759
<b>she's not an evil person.</b>

556
00:28:33,089 --> 00:28:34,930
<b>Don't just end it like this.</b>

557
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:38,259
<b>Think about the possibilities.
The likelihood of it working out.</b>

558
00:28:39,869 --> 00:28:41,130
<b>Can't you do it?</b>

559
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:45,970
<b>Are you so sick of her that
just looking at her annoys you?</b>

560
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:47,670
<b>It's not that.</b>

561
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:51,140
<b>We didn't make the decision lightly.</b>

562
00:28:51,509 --> 00:28:55,150
<b>I know.
Who makes that decision lightly?</b>

563
00:28:56,150 --> 00:28:59,079
<b>To be frank,
I have no right to lecture you.</b>

564
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:02,049
<b>I was the first to get divorced
in my family.</b>

565
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:05,920
<b>But when I did get divorced,</b>

566
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:09,230
<b>I really worked myself almost crazy
to try to make it work.</b>

567
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:11,200
<b>To try to change Hyun Gyung's mind,</b>

568
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,029
<b>I went on my knees
on that stone floor...</b>

569
00:29:14,029 --> 00:29:17,039
<b>and hurt both kneecaps and...</b>

570
00:29:18,869 --> 00:29:20,140
<b>I was in a wheelchair for a while.</b>

571
00:29:20,369 --> 00:29:24,210
<b>I clung to Hyun Gyung
while in that wheelchair...</b>

572
00:29:25,339 --> 00:29:26,950
<b>and begged her to save me.</b>

573
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:33,920
<b>To be honest, it's not a crime
to want to look after others.</b>

574
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:36,220
<b>Shouldn't a man be loyal?</b>

575
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:40,690
<b>A friend I used to work and eat with
was about to become homeless.</b>

576
00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:43,160
<b>What human being would ignore that?</b>

577
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:46,000
<b>That's not right!
That's not what a human should do!</b>

578
00:29:47,029 --> 00:29:48,130
<b>You're right.</b>

579
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:54,210
<b>Hey, let's be honest here.
What did I do that's so wrong?</b>

580
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:55,710
<b>What did I do?</b>

581
00:30:01,609 --> 00:30:05,549
<b>I really, really worked hard.</b>

582
00:30:06,079 --> 00:30:11,160
<b>I wanted my wife and kids
to have a good life.</b>

583
00:30:11,789 --> 00:30:16,029
<b>All I did was work hard
and torture myself to do so!</b>

584
00:30:16,529 --> 00:30:20,000
<b>I know, Joon Seon.
How about you calm down?</b>

585
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,829
<b>Did I get hurt because I wanted to?</b>

586
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:27,109
<b>Did I guarantee a friend's loan
because I wanted to lose my money?</b>

587
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:30,579
<b>Can you be quiet?
Did you rent this restaurant?</b>

588
00:30:30,579 --> 00:30:32,880
<b>What? Did I rent this restaurant?</b>

589
00:30:33,549 --> 00:30:35,849
<b>You're a bit rude
considering we're strangers.</b>

590
00:30:35,849 --> 00:30:38,279
<b>- What?
- No, no. I apologize.</b>

591
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:40,319
<b>He had a lot to drink. I'm sorry.</b>

592
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:44,089
<b>Gyu Jin. Call my ex-wife.
I have something to tell her.</b>

593
00:30:45,319 --> 00:30:46,430
<b>Hyun Gyung!</b>

594
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:49,089
<b>- Hyun Gyung!
- Joon Seon!</b>

595
00:30:49,089 --> 00:30:51,700
<b>- Will you get him out of here?
- Hyun Gyung!</b>

596
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,569
<b>- I'm sorry. Sorry.
- Let go of me.</b>

597
00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:56,230
<b>Yes, I'm poor
and can't afford an apartment.</b>

598
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:57,240
<b>No, why...</b>

599
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,809
<b>My wife divorced me
and I moved in with my parents.</b>

600
00:30:59,809 --> 00:31:01,210
<b>Get up, will you?</b>

601
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:02,539
<b>Shall I keep going?</b>

602
00:31:02,539 --> 00:31:04,210
<b>- I'm...
- Get him out of here!</b>

603
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:08,609
<b>I didn't keep it from you
because I looked down on you.</b>

604
00:31:08,609 --> 00:31:09,750
<b>Don't think so.</b>

605
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:12,950
<b>I know you didn't.
That's just our inferiority talking.</b>

606
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:17,990
<b>So?</b>

607
00:31:19,089 --> 00:31:20,630
<b>How do you really feel?</b>

608
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:23,099
<b>Are you really over it?</b>

609
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:25,329
<b>Yes.</b>

610
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:29,940
<b>I actually feel more relieved
now that you all know.</b>

611
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:31,569
<b>No, not that.</b>

612
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:36,240
<b>Your feelings for Gyu Jin.
Are you really over him?</b>

613
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,380
<b>Of course.</b>

614
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:39,339
<b>Would I have divorced him
if I weren't?</b>

615
00:31:40,109 --> 00:31:43,079
<b>I'm asking because I don't get it.</b>

616
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:46,390
<b>Our situations are different,</b>

617
00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:49,720
<b>but I left with Ji Hun
before the divorce was finalized...</b>

618
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:52,190
<b>because I didn't want to
even breathe the same air.</b>

619
00:31:53,329 --> 00:31:56,029
<b>That's how people are like
when they split up.</b>

620
00:31:56,089 --> 00:31:57,700
<b>But not you and Gyu Jin.</b>

621
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:00,730
<b>You still live and work together.</b>

622
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:05,339
<b>That's because we'd lose too much
if we sold the apartment then.</b>

623
00:32:05,339 --> 00:32:08,069
<b>And we hadn't told Mom and Dad yet.</b>

624
00:32:08,069 --> 00:32:11,440
<b>So you stayed with him?
I don't think that's you.</b>

625
00:32:12,609 --> 00:32:14,509
<b>Look carefully into your mind.</b>

626
00:32:15,309 --> 00:32:17,849
<b>Is it really because of
those silly reasons,</b>

627
00:32:17,849 --> 00:32:21,250
<b>or are you not yet ready
to leave Gyu Jin?</b>

628
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:22,990
<b>It's really not like that.</b>

629
00:32:23,619 --> 00:32:25,990
<b>We couldn't ignore
reality and finances.</b>

630
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:27,029
<b>No?</b>

631
00:32:28,359 --> 00:32:30,529
<b>If that's what you say.</b>

632
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:34,430
<b>It's really not easy.</b>

633
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:39,200
<b>For a man and woman to marry
and live an ordinary life.</b>

634
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,539
<b>You're not drinking?</b>

635
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:48,950
<b>I have to work tomorrow.</b>

636
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:50,319
<b>You're so firm.</b>

637
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:54,390
<b>Fine. Your jobless sister
will drink it all for you.</b>

638
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:01,829
<b>Where did Joon Seon and Ga Hee go?</b>

639
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:04,599
<b>Joon Seon said he has
an important meeting.</b>

640
00:33:04,599 --> 00:33:05,759
<b>Mom too, Grandpa.</b>

641
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,839
<b>The only meetings they'd have
in the evening is with alcohol.</b>

642
00:33:09,839 --> 00:33:11,940
<b>Don't say that.</b>

643
00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:14,140
<b>He's a CEO now,
so don't speak of him like that.</b>

644
00:33:14,170 --> 00:33:16,369
<b>We don't hear anything, ma'am.</b>

645
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:18,880
<b>Speak freely as if we're invisible.</b>

646
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,779
<b>Why? Did you just say something?</b>

647
00:33:20,779 --> 00:33:23,619
<b>He says things
when he doesn't really mean it.</b>

648
00:33:23,619 --> 00:33:25,519
<b>Don't take him seriously.</b>

649
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:26,720
<b>I almost forgot.</b>

650
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:37,460
<b>Auntie said this is
your birthday present.</b>

651
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:41,130
<b>It's from Hyun Gyung?
When did she buy this?</b>

652
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,700
<b>How sweet of her.</b>

653
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:46,509
<b>Why did she buy something
when she barely supports her family?</b>

654
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:48,309
<b>Just accept it.</b>

655
00:33:48,339 --> 00:33:49,910
<b>It's not like
she can ignore our birthdays.</b>

656
00:33:49,910 --> 00:33:52,410
<b>She visits all the time
to drop off the kids.</b>

657
00:33:53,349 --> 00:33:57,250
<b>Gosh, it's a shirt.
Look at the lovely color.</b>

658
00:33:57,250 --> 00:33:58,880
<b>Honey, let's see.</b>

659
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,589
<b>It suits you so nicely.</b>

660
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:04,990
<b>How sweet of her.</b>

661
00:34:05,789 --> 00:34:07,630
<b>Thank her for me, will you?</b>

662
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:08,660
<b>I will.</b>

663
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,200
<b>You're done already? Eat some more.</b>

664
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,869
<b>I had enough.</b>

665
00:34:14,069 --> 00:34:16,539
<b>I'll get changed. Pack some food...</b>

666
00:34:16,539 --> 00:34:20,340
<b>I know. I already packed
some rice and side dishes.</b>

667
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:22,070
<b>You want to visit Ms. Park.</b>

668
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:25,239
<b>I was married to you for years.
I know you well enough.</b>

669
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:39,960
<b>I'm sorry, but could you
point me to the restroom?</b>

670
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:43,829
<b>Please turn right at
the end of the building.</b>

671
00:34:43,829 --> 00:34:45,659
<b>- It's on the second floor.
- Thank you.</b>

672
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:59,210
<b>There's nothing on the left.</b>

673
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:02,280
<b>I said, "right", ma'am.</b>

674
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,780
<b>Yes, of course. I forgot.
Thanks again.</b>

675
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:05,920
<b>Sure.</b>

676
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:19,860
<b>Let me just take you there...</b>

677
00:35:22,269 --> 00:35:24,239
<b>Good evening, traitor.</b>

678
00:35:25,639 --> 00:35:26,710
<b>Mr. Yoon...</b>

679
00:35:37,310 --> 00:35:38,809
<b>(Episode 24)</b>

680
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:44,480
<b>I'm truly sorry.</b>

681
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:48,119
<b>I had no choice but to tell them.</b>

682
00:35:48,119 --> 00:35:52,289
<b>My big sister thought
that Gyu Jin was having an affair.</b>

683
00:35:52,359 --> 00:35:55,690
<b>She was about to track him down.</b>

684
00:35:55,690 --> 00:35:59,100
<b>She and my brother
are the temperamental types.</b>

685
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:02,000
<b>They usually take action
instead of talking things out.</b>

686
00:36:02,699 --> 00:36:05,570
<b>They thought Gyu Jin was cheating?</b>

687
00:36:06,039 --> 00:36:08,509
<b>How could they suspect that
of someone like him?</b>

688
00:36:08,509 --> 00:36:12,280
<b>Exactly! That's why
I had no choice but to...</b>

689
00:36:15,549 --> 00:36:17,450
<b>I'm truly sorry.</b>

690
00:36:17,450 --> 00:36:21,090
<b>I don't deserve your forgiveness.</b>

691
00:36:26,759 --> 00:36:27,829
<b>Forget it.</b>

692
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:32,600
<b>I'm hurt too deeply
to let this go with just an apology.</b>

693
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:34,630
<b>What?</b>

694
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:35,829
<b>Just so you know,</b>

695
00:36:35,869 --> 00:36:39,640
<b>this has made me
lose faith in people.</b>

696
00:36:39,969 --> 00:36:41,709
<b>I trusted you with all my heart,</b>

697
00:36:43,010 --> 00:36:45,609
<b>but you stabbed me in the back.</b>

698
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:49,709
<b>I'm the idiot here.
I deserve what happened.</b>

699
00:36:49,709 --> 00:36:53,019
<b>No way. This is all my fault.</b>

700
00:36:53,019 --> 00:36:54,890
<b>I'm the one who betrayed you.</b>

701
00:36:55,319 --> 00:36:57,250
<b>Do you have any idea
how my day has been?</b>

702
00:36:58,060 --> 00:37:00,120
<b>Even though I was starving,
I couldn't go to the cafeteria.</b>

703
00:37:00,689 --> 00:37:03,790
<b>I was afraid of running into Gyu Jin
and getting my butt kicked again.</b>

704
00:37:05,159 --> 00:37:07,569
<b>I couldn't go to the lounge
to get a cup of coffee either.</b>

705
00:37:07,569 --> 00:37:09,799
<b>Why? Because I didn't want
to run into Na Hee.</b>

706
00:37:09,969 --> 00:37:12,340
<b>I felt so ashamed!</b>

707
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:13,599
<b>Mr. Yoon,</b>

708
00:37:14,469 --> 00:37:16,569
<b>I'm truly sorry.</b>

709
00:37:16,810 --> 00:37:19,780
<b>What can I do to appease your anger?</b>

710
00:37:19,909 --> 00:37:23,079
<b>Go ahead and tell me.
I'll do anything.</b>

711
00:37:24,109 --> 00:37:26,480
<b>I'm too shocked
to think of anything right now.</b>

712
00:37:28,349 --> 00:37:29,890
<b>I need some time to think...</b>

713
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:33,459
<b>because nothing can possibly
make me feel better right now.</b>

714
00:37:36,189 --> 00:37:37,290
<b>Mr. Yoon.</b>

715
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,400
<b>Let me go.</b>

716
00:37:47,539 --> 00:37:50,409
<b>Oh, no. He must truly be upset.</b>

717
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:54,710
<b>Why didn't I keep my mouth shut?</b>

718
00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:58,219
<b>Nothing was solved
and look where I ended up?</b>

719
00:38:05,990 --> 00:38:07,830
<b>Gosh, she's so easy to fool.</b>

720
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:11,460
<b>Her response is priceless.
Talk about it being fun.</b>

721
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:13,500
<b>I should pretend
to be upset for a few more days.</b>

722
00:38:22,639 --> 00:38:24,939
<b>Have another piece of this eel.</b>

723
00:38:25,509 --> 00:38:26,639
<b>Go ahead.</b>

724
00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:29,949
<b>There you go.</b>

725
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:33,379
<b>Why did you hold back
when you have an appetite?</b>

726
00:38:34,919 --> 00:38:36,719
<b>I'm just grateful, that's all.</b>

727

<b>And I'm sorry.</b>

<b>This isn't for free, you know.</b>

729
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:44,400
<b>I'm taking all the spring onions
and peeled garlic you have.</b>

730
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,530
<b>Of course.</b>

731
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:49,430
<b>You can have all of my spring onions
and garlic.</b>

732
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:51,099
<b>- Really?
- Of course.</b>

733
00:38:51,099 --> 00:38:53,099
<b>- You promised.
- Sure thing.</b>

734
00:38:53,099 --> 00:38:54,569

<b>but now the sky is clear.</b>

739

<b>Yes, of course. Impatient as always.</b>

<b>You haven't been around that long.</b>

<b>Well, we bumped into each other

00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:32,339
<b>The ladies dig that these days.</b>

754
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:33,970
<b>You see it on TV a lot.</b>

755
00:40:34,939 --> 00:40:37,139
<b>Who comes up with these things?</b>

756
00:40:37,939 --> 00:40:41,350
<b>Anyway, I hope she gets better soon.</b>

757
00:40:42,279 --> 00:40:45,519
<b>I feel terrible
when I see old ladies get sick.</b>

758
00:40:46,649 --> 00:40:49,720
<b>My mom fell ill
to lung disease, you see.</b>

759
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:53,160
<b>That's what happened to me too.</b>

760
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:57,800
<b>Wait. Did your mom
suffer from a lung disease?</b>

761
00:40:58,129 --> 00:41:03,000
<b>Yes, it was common back in the day
among poor families.</b>

762
00:41:04,269 --> 00:41:09,269
<b>Just so you know,
I suffered a severe fever as a kid,</b>

763
00:41:09,269 --> 00:41:10,839
<b>so I have no recollection
of my past.</b>

764
00:41:11,339 --> 00:41:15,550
<b>The memory of my mom being bedridden
is as clear as day though.</b>

765
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:17,750
<b>She would...</b>

766
00:41:18,379 --> 00:41:20,980
<b>cough all night.</b>

767
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:24,389
<b>I was so worried that
she'd pass away any time soon.</b>

768
00:41:24,389 --> 00:41:27,120
<b>I'd wake up
just to put my ears on her chest...</b>

769
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:29,560
<b>and I kept doing that.</b>

770
00:41:31,699 --> 00:41:33,930
<b>I still have nightmares about it.</b>

771
00:41:36,029 --> 00:41:38,339
<b>What I also remember is a song.</b>

772
00:41:39,339 --> 00:41:41,139
<b>The one my older brother
used to sing.</b>

773
00:41:44,310 --> 00:41:46,379
<b>Yes, hello? Dad!</b>

774
00:41:47,110 --> 00:41:50,110
<b>I was going to call you tomorrow.
I guess you read my mind.</b>

775
00:41:50,279 --> 00:41:51,620
<b>Right. Just a second.</b>

776
00:41:52,350 --> 00:41:54,649
<b>Mr. Song, I'm going that way.</b>

777
00:41:55,350 --> 00:41:56,790
<b>- Sure.
- I'll see you around.</b>

778
00:41:57,990 --> 00:42:00,990
<b>Yes, Dad. You're not sick
or anything, right?</b>

779
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:06,600
<b>Of course, I'm doing fine.</b>

780
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:15,540
<b>- We're here.
- I'm getting off now!</b>

781
00:42:15,810 --> 00:42:17,310
<b>Joon Seon...
Gosh, thank you so much.</b>

782
00:42:17,310 --> 00:42:18,439
<b>Bye, sir.</b>

783
00:42:18,709 --> 00:42:19,839
<b>Joon Seon, this way.</b>

784
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:22,310
<b>Call Hyun Gyung for me.</b>

785
00:42:22,310 --> 00:42:24,850
<b>- Hyun Gyung, I miss you.
- You're at your house!</b>

786
00:42:24,850 --> 00:42:26,050
<b>Gyu Jin?</b>

787
00:42:26,819 --> 00:42:28,490
<b>Father.</b>

788
00:42:28,589 --> 00:42:29,990
<b>Dad.</b>

789
00:42:30,189 --> 00:42:32,389
<b>I miss Hyun Gyung.</b>

790
00:42:33,689 --> 00:42:35,990
<b>Where did he get wasted like this?</b>

791
00:42:36,430 --> 00:42:38,600
<b>He said he had plans.
Was it with you?</b>

792
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:41,060
<b>Yes, things got a bit out of hand,
I'm afraid.</b>

793
00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:42,430
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

794
00:42:42,430 --> 00:42:43,829
<b>Why would you be apologizing?</b>

795
00:42:43,829 --> 00:42:46,399
<b>It's his fault for getting wasted
all by himself.</b>

796
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:47,740
<b>You should come in with us.</b>

797
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:49,839
<b>No, it's fine, Father.
It's late anyway.</b>

798
00:42:50,009 --> 00:42:51,639
<b>You won't step inside?</b>

799
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:53,509
<b>I have work tomorrow anyway.</b>

800
00:42:54,110 --> 00:42:55,209
<b>Joon Seon, take care.</b>

801
00:42:55,209 --> 00:42:57,410
<b>Father, I'll get going. Goodnight.</b>

802
00:42:58,519 --> 00:42:59,879
<b>Gyu Jin.</b>

803
00:42:59,879 --> 00:43:02,689
<b>- Gyu Jin...
- That jerk.</b>

804
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:03,990
<b>Attention.</b>

805
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:05,420
<b>At ease.</b>

806
00:43:06,889 --> 00:43:07,930
<b>Get a grip on yourself...</b>

807
00:43:07,930 --> 00:43:09,029
<b>- and come inside.
- Sure.</b>

808
00:43:12,899 --> 00:43:14,300
<b>Dad!</b>

809
00:43:14,769 --> 00:43:16,329
<b>- Come on.
- Sure.</b>

810
00:43:19,069 --> 00:43:22,110
<b>Bye, Na Hee. I'll get going.</b>

811
00:43:22,139 --> 00:43:24,439
<b>Get home safely
and text me when you get there.</b>

812
00:43:25,610 --> 00:43:26,980
<b>Okay.</b>

813
00:43:29,310 --> 00:43:31,279
<b>You, smarty-pants.</b>

814
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:35,220
<b>Just do whatever you want.</b>

815
00:43:35,889 --> 00:43:38,660
<b>It's not like others
can live your life for you.</b>

816
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:42,629
<b>Your life is yours.</b>

817
00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:52,370
<b>Gosh. Hello.</b>

818
00:44:08,450 --> 00:44:10,049
<b>So you stayed with him?</b>

819
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:11,820
<b>I don't think that's you.</b>

820
00:44:12,259 --> 00:44:14,320
<b>Look carefully into your mind.</b>

821
00:44:15,059 --> 00:44:17,559
<b>Is it really because of
those silly reasons,</b>

822
00:44:17,559 --> 00:44:21,299
<b>or are you not yet ready
to leave Gyu Jin?</b>

823
00:44:59,870 --> 00:45:00,970
<b>Dr. Song!</b>

824
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:03,509
<b>Jeong Rok?</b>

825
00:45:08,110 --> 00:45:11,379
<b>Why is it that I always
run into you around here?</b>

826
00:45:14,850 --> 00:45:16,549
<b>You didn't have
to give me a ride home.</b>

827
00:45:17,590 --> 00:45:19,559
<b>The state you're in disagrees.</b>

828
00:45:19,559 --> 00:45:22,659
<b>Why were you getting soaked
in the rain like a moody teenager?</b>

829
00:45:22,990 --> 00:45:26,759
<b>I never felt this way
when I was a teen, you know.</b>

830
00:45:28,299 --> 00:45:30,970
<b>So why are you
heading home this late?</b>

831
00:45:31,169 --> 00:45:33,299
<b>I was in the neighborhood...</b>

832
00:45:33,299 --> 00:45:36,009
<b>and the director made me
join him for dinner.</b>

833
00:45:36,710 --> 00:45:39,139
<b>I couldn't even drink
because of tomorrow's surgery.</b>

834
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:40,679
<b>It must've been boring.</b>

835
00:45:40,679 --> 00:45:41,909
<b>You have no idea.</b>

836
00:45:41,909 --> 00:45:45,080
<b>He told me his life story
from when he was a medical student.</b>

837
00:45:47,179 --> 00:45:49,649
<b>Then he talked about
you and Gyu Jin as well.</b>

838
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:51,519
<b>The man relies on you two a lot.</b>

839
00:46:21,389 --> 00:46:25,759
<b>I'm confused as it is,
so why did it have to rain?</b>

840
00:46:41,470 --> 00:46:43,570
<b>I could've just made a run for it.</b>

841
00:46:43,570 --> 00:46:45,879
<b>It's fine. You'll really
catch a cold at this rate.</b>

842
00:46:46,039 --> 00:46:47,179
<b>Come on.</b>

843
00:46:58,919 --> 00:47:00,889
<b>Thank you for always helping me out.</b>

844
00:47:01,190 --> 00:47:04,429
<b>It's not for free, you know.
I'll cash in a favor at least once.</b>

845
00:47:05,659 --> 00:47:07,129
<b>I doubt you'll need anything.</b>

846
00:47:07,559 --> 00:47:09,230
<b>You should get going then. Bye.</b>

847
00:47:20,210 --> 00:47:22,149
<b>Were they together all day...</b>

848
00:47:22,309 --> 00:47:23,779
<b>or did they meet up again?</b>

849
00:47:26,649 --> 00:47:28,149
<b>When did they become best friends?</b>

850
00:47:36,759 --> 00:47:37,830
<b>You're home.</b>

851
00:47:38,529 --> 00:47:40,059
<b>Isn't it obvious?</b>

852
00:47:42,570 --> 00:47:43,899
<b>Gyu Jin.</b>

853
00:47:44,129 --> 00:47:45,500
<b>What? Why?</b>

854
00:47:46,169 --> 00:47:48,970
<b>Can I ask you something?</b>

855
00:47:49,639 --> 00:47:50,740
<b>Ask me what?</b>

856
00:47:51,610 --> 00:47:54,210
<b>Why do you keep living with me?</b>

857
00:47:54,379 --> 00:47:55,509
<b>What?</b>

858
00:47:56,850 --> 00:47:58,879
<b>Why are you staying
in this house with me...</b>

859
00:47:59,549 --> 00:48:01,519
<b>when our divorce has been finalized?</b>

860
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:02,649
<b>What?</b>

861
00:48:03,549 --> 00:48:05,659
<b>It's because of the house price.</b>

862
00:48:05,759 --> 00:48:07,919
<b>We'll lose 100,000 dollars
if we sell it now.</b>

863
00:48:08,590 --> 00:48:09,789
<b>Is that the only reason?</b>

864
00:48:10,159 --> 00:48:12,759
<b>Of course. Must I have another?</b>

865
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:16,529
<b>By the way, why didn't you...</b>

866
00:48:16,570 --> 00:48:18,740
<b>shake off the water first
before entering the house?</b>

867
00:48:18,899 --> 00:48:21,070
<b>There was water
all over the front entrance.</b>

868
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:23,570
<b>Have you no basic manners?</b>

869
00:48:24,879 --> 00:48:28,039
<b>Of course.
I doubt there's another reason.</b>

870
00:48:32,019 --> 00:48:34,279
<b>What was that all about?</b>

871
00:48:36,649 --> 00:48:39,659
<b>This darn remote control
gets jammed all the time!</b>

872
00:48:44,789 --> 00:48:46,600
<b>Let go of me.</b>

873
00:48:46,830 --> 00:48:48,169
<b>Bring me Hyun Gyung.</b>

874
00:48:48,529 --> 00:48:50,070
<b>Hyun Gyung!</b>

875
00:48:50,070 --> 00:48:52,299
<b>I can't believe you got this wasted.</b>

876
00:48:52,299 --> 00:48:53,570
<b>Get a grip on yourself.</b>

877
00:48:53,570 --> 00:48:54,909
<b>Hyun Gyung...</b>

878
00:48:56,110 --> 00:48:57,669
<b>Unbelievable.</b>

879
00:48:57,669 --> 00:49:01,509
<b>Why can't you drink
as much as you can handle?</b>

880
00:49:01,509 --> 00:49:03,679
<b>Get up, Joon Seon.</b>

881
00:49:03,679 --> 00:49:05,350
<b>Here. Drink some honey water.</b>

882
00:49:05,350 --> 00:49:07,120
<b>Mom?</b>

883
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:08,820
<b>Just so you know,
this honey is expensive...</b>

884
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:11,759
<b>and I'm risking getting
scolded by your dad.</b>

885
00:49:11,759 --> 00:49:13,460
<b>Here you go.</b>

886
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:15,929
<b>Mom...</b>

887
00:49:17,759 --> 00:49:19,500
<b>What on earth? Gosh, you stink.</b>

888
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:20,830
<b>Get away from me.</b>

889
00:49:20,830 --> 00:49:22,269
<b>Get off me!</b>

890
00:49:22,269 --> 00:49:23,899
<b>My poor mom.</b>

891
00:49:24,070 --> 00:49:26,539
<b>You must've sinned
in your past life.</b>

892
00:49:26,639 --> 00:49:28,269
<b>My gosh.</b>

893
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:30,240
<b>Are you kidding me?</b>

894
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:33,440
<b>Why are you wasted
when Gyu Jin was perfectly sober?</b>

895
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:35,009
<b>Mom...</b>

896
00:49:35,309 --> 00:49:37,980
<b>My poor mom.</b>

897
00:49:38,879 --> 00:49:40,220
<b>Unbelievable.</b>

898
00:49:40,220 --> 00:49:43,250
<b>Just kill me already. My gosh.</b>

899
00:49:46,690 --> 00:49:47,759
<b>Mom?</b>

900
00:49:49,730 --> 00:49:51,059
<b>Mom!</b>

901
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:56,899
<b>You must've sinned
in your past life.</b>

902
00:49:56,899 --> 00:49:59,570
<b>What did you do to deserve this?</b>

903
00:49:59,740 --> 00:50:03,009
<b>Who are you to comment
on my past life?</b>

904
00:50:03,009 --> 00:50:06,440
<b>How can you get wasted like this
when you have a son to care for?</b>

905
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:08,139
<b>Are you out of your mind?</b>

906
00:50:08,139 --> 00:50:11,409
<b>- How insane are you?
- That hurts.</b>

907
00:50:11,679 --> 00:50:13,279
<b>Mom, I'm sorry.</b>

908
00:50:13,279 --> 00:50:15,620
<b>Stop it.
You're pulling my pants down!</b>

909
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:19,120
<b>That's enough.
I can't believe you two.</b>

910
00:50:29,470 --> 00:50:32,470
<b>Why would she suddenly ask me that?
Now I can't stop thinking about it.</b>

911
00:50:35,210 --> 00:50:37,809
<b>Whatever. Stop thinking
about it and go to sleep.</b>

912
00:50:38,169 --> 00:50:42,250
<b>Let's go to sleep.
Only think about tomorrow.</b>

913
00:50:44,309 --> 00:50:45,850
<b>I have to get to work,</b>

914
00:50:45,850 --> 00:50:47,149
<b>so I must sleep.</b>

915
00:50:47,149 --> 00:50:48,889
<b>Darn it!</b>

916
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,269
<b>Tall with long limbs.</b>

917
00:51:06,039 --> 00:51:07,639
<b>Why would he stick
to part-time jobs?</b>

918
00:51:07,799 --> 00:51:09,940
<b>If I were him,
I'd train to be an athlete...</b>

919
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:12,080
<b>and compete in the Olympics.</b>

920
00:51:12,610 --> 00:51:13,639
<b>Jong Soo,</b>

921
00:51:13,879 --> 00:51:15,950
<b>not everyone can get
on the national team.</b>

922
00:51:15,950 --> 00:51:17,649
<b>Besides, his muscles are for show.</b>

923
00:51:17,980 --> 00:51:21,620
<b>There are some bodies
that easily get pumped up.</b>

924
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:24,450
<b>I bet that his muscles
aren't even firm.</b>

925
00:51:24,549 --> 00:51:25,559
<b>Jeong Bong,</b>

926
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:27,889
<b>did you apply
BB cream on your face?</b>

927
00:51:28,059 --> 00:51:29,129
<b>No.</b>

928
00:51:29,559 --> 00:51:30,929
<b>Yes, a little.</b>

929
00:51:31,799 --> 00:51:35,029
<b>We live on the rooftop,
so the sun was getting to me.</b>

930
00:51:35,470 --> 00:51:36,600
<b>- Is it that obvious?
- Yes.</b>

931
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:38,200
<b>You look like a ghost.</b>

932
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:40,870
<b>Really? Did I apply too much?</b>

933
00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:43,740
<b>You're trying to look good
for Ga Hee, right?</b>

934
00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:45,679
<b>Just tell her how you feel.</b>

935
00:51:48,509 --> 00:51:52,179
<b>Ga Hee isn't someone
to be disgustingly drooled over.</b>

936
00:51:52,419 --> 00:51:56,049
<b>She's someone I can't
possibly think of approaching.</b>

937
00:51:56,750 --> 00:51:58,690
<b>An angel from above
is how I see her.</b>

938
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:03,960
<b>I guess you guys are working out.</b>

939
00:52:04,090 --> 00:52:05,330
<b>That's good.</b>

940
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:06,759
<b>Good morning, Ga Hee.</b>

941
00:52:06,759 --> 00:52:07,759
<b>Hello.</b>

942
00:52:08,429 --> 00:52:10,169
<b>Well... Here's the thing.</b>

943
00:52:10,269 --> 00:52:14,769
<b>Joon Seon is using
the bathroom downstairs.</b>

944
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:16,409
<b>Do you mind if I use
the bathroom here?</b>

945
00:52:16,610 --> 00:52:18,169
<b>Sure. Go ahead and use it.</b>

946
00:52:18,169 --> 00:52:19,240
<b>Okay.</b>

947
00:52:20,509 --> 00:52:22,110
<b>It happens every time I drink.</b>

948
00:52:27,179 --> 00:52:30,690
<b>I guess even the angel
has bowel movements too.</b>

949
00:52:31,990 --> 00:52:34,090
<b>She didn't say what she was doing.</b>

950
00:52:34,090 --> 00:52:35,990
<b>She might be here to wash up.</b>

951
00:52:35,990 --> 00:52:37,629
<b>She says it happens
every time she drinks.</b>

952
00:52:37,659 --> 00:52:39,099
<b>It's so obvious.</b>

953
00:52:39,130 --> 00:52:40,160
<b>What?</b>

954
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:43,299
<b>Why are you always so negative?</b>

955
00:52:43,299 --> 00:52:47,099
<b>You can't live like that.
You can't be happy that way.</b>

956
00:52:48,809 --> 00:52:51,980
<b>Did you laugh? How...
Are you happy now?</b>

957
00:52:52,309 --> 00:52:55,279
<b>Am I funny?
Do you think I'm hilarious?</b>

958
00:52:58,579 --> 00:53:00,279
<b>Thank you for letting me use it.</b>

959
00:53:02,619 --> 00:53:06,019
<b>You probably want to use the toilet
about five minutes later.</b>

960
00:53:07,589 --> 00:53:10,289
<b>Bye, Ga Hee.
Come again if you need anything.</b>

961
00:53:11,289 --> 00:53:12,359
<b>I should go to the bathroom.</b>

962
00:53:14,730 --> 00:53:15,829
<b>What? Why?</b>

963
00:53:20,839 --> 00:53:23,339
<b>She's even worse than Joon Seon.</b>

964
00:53:24,769 --> 00:53:27,279
<b>No. That can't be right.</b>

965
00:53:28,279 --> 00:53:29,309
<b>She's my angel.</b>

966
00:53:30,109 --> 00:53:32,420
<b>She can't have caused this smell.</b>

967
00:53:33,049 --> 00:53:34,079
<b>No!</b>

968
00:53:39,490 --> 00:53:41,619
<b>You are coming out just now.</b>

969
00:53:42,759 --> 00:53:44,789
<b>Hey, how did it go yesterday?</b>

970
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:48,160
<b>What about you?</b>

971
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:51,000
<b>I tried, but he seemed
quite determined.</b>

972
00:53:51,470 --> 00:53:53,740
<b>- Gosh, I have to go again.
- My gosh.</b>

973
00:53:54,599 --> 00:53:57,109
<b>- Wait, Joon Seon.
- What?</b>

974
00:53:57,910 --> 00:53:59,140
<b>- Go.
- Hey.</b>

975
00:53:59,140 --> 00:54:01,910
<b>What am I supposed to do?</b>

976
00:54:14,759 --> 00:54:16,660
<b>Why isn't she coming out?</b>

977
00:54:17,559 --> 00:54:19,559
<b>Even if she wakes up now,
she will be late.</b>

978
00:54:22,630 --> 00:54:23,670
<b>What's wrong...</b>

979
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,039
<b>I don't know.</b>

980
00:54:27,869 --> 00:54:29,740
<b>I don't care.
That's not my business.</b>

981
00:54:30,109 --> 00:54:32,309
<b>I don't care
if you're late for work.</b>

982
00:54:33,009 --> 00:54:34,880
<b>Why isn't it closing?</b>

983
00:54:42,549 --> 00:54:46,890
<b>I'd like you to take care
of the parking fee issue.</b>

984
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:50,359
<b>Okay. Don't worry.
I'll take care of it.</b>

985
00:54:51,359 --> 00:54:54,660
<b>Okay. So it's all settled.
Let's wrap it up then.</b>

986
00:54:54,660 --> 00:54:55,769
<b>Okay.</b>

987
00:54:55,769 --> 00:54:58,200
<b>- Mr. Song, I will give you a call.
- Okay.</b>

988
00:54:58,200 --> 00:54:59,670
<b>I'm busy, so I should get going.</b>

989
00:54:59,670 --> 00:55:00,940
<b>Okay.</b>

990
00:55:01,099 --> 00:55:03,240
<b>- I'll see you at the next meeting.
- Okay.</b>

991
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:05,069
<b>- Bye.
- See you.</b>

992
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:12,380
<b>I should get going then, Mr. Song.</b>

993
00:55:13,779 --> 00:55:15,420
<b>Are you going
to the kimbap restaurant again?</b>

994
00:55:16,349 --> 00:55:19,190
<b>Well... Not necessarily.</b>

995
00:55:20,660 --> 00:55:22,289
<b>Fine. I'm going there. Why?</b>

996
00:55:22,289 --> 00:55:26,029
<b>I finally met the woman
of my dreams at this age.</b>

997
00:55:26,029 --> 00:55:27,430
<b>Can't I go there?</b>

998
00:55:27,430 --> 00:55:28,829
<b>She seems nice.</b>

999
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:30,930
<b>What?</b>

1000
00:55:31,529 --> 00:55:34,900
<b>The owner of the kimbap restaurant.
She seems better than I thought.</b>

1001
00:55:36,940 --> 00:55:38,940
<b>Really? Are you serious?</b>

1002
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:41,079
<b>You said I lost my mind
the other day.</b>

1003
00:55:41,079 --> 00:55:43,779
<b>What changed your mind
all of a sudden?</b>

1004
00:55:43,779 --> 00:55:47,119
<b>Things can change.
What's the big deal?</b>

1005
00:55:47,349 --> 00:55:49,150
<b>If you don't like it,
it's fine by me.</b>

1006
00:55:49,250 --> 00:55:52,059
<b>Gosh, no. I'm just grateful.</b>

1007
00:55:52,059 --> 00:55:55,390
<b>To be honest, it weighed on my mind.</b>

1008
00:55:55,390 --> 00:55:57,160
<b>I felt bad to like
a woman you hated.</b>

1009
00:55:57,160 --> 00:56:00,930
<b>But now that you say it,
I feel much better.</b>

1010
00:56:01,329 --> 00:56:04,700
<b>Gosh, that's not true.
Don't say anything you don't mean.</b>

1011
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:07,900
<b>Why did you frequent the restaurant
when you felt bad?</b>

1012
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:11,009
<b>If it weren't for you,
I would've lived there already.</b>

1013
00:56:11,170 --> 00:56:14,180
<b>Fine. Go ahead and live there now.</b>

1014
00:56:14,940 --> 00:56:16,210
<b>Just go.</b>

1015
00:56:16,349 --> 00:56:18,950
<b>Then I'll go to see her
with a light heart.</b>

1016
00:56:19,150 --> 00:56:21,349
<b>- See you, Mr. Song.
- My gosh.</b>

1017
00:56:21,519 --> 00:56:24,920
<b>I'm going to see Cho Yeon.</b>

1018
00:56:26,319 --> 00:56:30,059
<b>Gosh, he's deep in love
late in life.</b>

1019
00:56:30,059 --> 00:56:31,460
<b>My goodness.</b>

1020
00:56:35,930 --> 00:56:39,039
<b>Did you get your hair done?
It looks pretty.</b>

1021
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:42,109
<b>It's too long, so I got a perm.
Do you like it?</b>

1022
00:56:42,109 --> 00:56:43,710
<b>- You look pretty.
- Thank you.</b>

1023
00:56:46,210 --> 00:56:48,009
<b>Would he like my hairstyle?</b>

1024
00:56:50,009 --> 00:56:53,119
<b>Should I just go to
the butcher's shop to see him?</b>

1025
00:56:54,349 --> 00:56:57,119
<b>But I need a reason.</b>

1026
00:56:57,349 --> 00:57:00,619
<b>He used to hang around our store
all the time, but not anymore.</b>

1027
00:57:01,359 --> 00:57:03,660
<b>What is he up to?</b>

1028
00:57:06,759 --> 00:57:08,400
<b>I miss him so much.</b>

1029
00:57:13,269 --> 00:57:17,609
<b>I like it so much</b>

1030
00:57:22,349 --> 00:57:25,519
<b>What? Where is he going
feeling so excited?</b>

1031
00:57:29,589 --> 00:57:31,150
<b>Hello, everyone.</b>

1032
00:57:31,150 --> 00:57:33,259
<b>- Hello, Mr. Yang.
- You're here.</b>

1033
00:57:33,519 --> 00:57:35,289
<b>Why did you come so late?</b>

1034
00:57:35,289 --> 00:57:37,130
<b>I had a meeting
at the merchant association.</b>

1035
00:57:37,130 --> 00:57:40,829
<b>- Why? Were you waiting for me?
- Sure. Please come on in.</b>

1036
00:57:41,329 --> 00:57:43,200
<b>We will give you
a lot of freebies.</b>

1037
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:46,069
<b>That would be great. Let's go.</b>

1038
00:57:49,170 --> 00:57:52,079
<b>What? So does that mean
he didn't come to our store...</b>

1039
00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:53,779
<b>because of those wenches?</b>

1040
00:57:54,839 --> 00:57:58,509
<b>(Unnie's Kimbap)</b>

1041
00:58:02,450 --> 00:58:03,819
<b>You should've come early.</b>

1042
00:58:03,819 --> 00:58:05,819
<b>Young Dal is out
for the merchant association.</b>

1043
00:58:06,789 --> 00:58:08,930
<b>Did you get your hair done?</b>

1044
00:58:09,990 --> 00:58:13,559
<b>So he's been in and out
of that diner the whole time?</b>

1045
00:58:14,299 --> 00:58:17,900
<b>Gosh, it looks great.</b>

1046
00:58:17,900 --> 00:58:19,970
<b>I don't think you got it done
in a local salon. How much was it?</b>

1047
00:58:19,970 --> 00:58:22,109
<b>Gosh, I don't know.</b>

1048
00:58:22,109 --> 00:58:25,480
<b>You startled me. What's wrong?
Do you not like your hair?</b>

1049
00:58:26,339 --> 00:58:28,380
<b>It's not like that.</b>

1050
00:58:30,779 --> 00:58:33,680
<b>You don't have to know.
Don't talk to me.</b>

1051
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:39,019
<b>It must be 1 of the 2 wenches.</b>

1052
00:58:39,690 --> 00:58:40,920
<b>Those vixens.</b>

1053
00:58:41,859 --> 00:58:44,230
<b>My gosh. What's wrong?</b>

1054
00:58:44,230 --> 00:58:46,599
<b>Okay. I'm not talking to you.</b>

1055
00:58:46,599 --> 00:58:50,269
