<b>because it bounced back

<b>If only the skeletal system

<b>it's enough to know

<b>What was the cause of death?</b>

<b>One side of the lady's stomach was

<b>After CT and MRI scanning,
her womb was ruptured,</b>

<b>and the head of the fetus had

<b>Why didn't it rot?</b>

<b>They poured lime outside the tomb.</b>

551

<b>The lime hardened like cement...</b>

<b>After how many days

<b>You said you didn't believe

<b>Humans are organisms,</b>

<b>Come.</b>

602
00:56:26,369 --> 00:56:29,098
<b>- That kid isn't crying at all.
- You're right.</b>

603
00:56:29,098 --> 00:56:30,647
<b>Is it because he's so little?</b>

604
00:56:40,245 --> 00:56:41,799
<b>Jong Bum, tell me...</b>

605
00:56:42,565 --> 00:56:44,886
<b>what's on your mind right now.</b>

606
00:56:48,096 --> 00:56:51,931
<b>When we saw that dead puppy
in front of our house,</b>

607
00:56:52,439 --> 00:56:54,675
<b>you didn't think it was pitiful.</b>

608
00:56:55,127 --> 00:56:58,722
<b>You only said
you wanted to dissect it.</b>

609
00:57:00,009 --> 00:57:01,753
<b>You just want to...</b>

610
00:57:01,753 --> 00:57:04,401
<b>know more about Grandpa's body,
don't you?</b>

611
00:57:05,275 --> 00:57:07,888
<b>You can tell me honestly.</b>

612
00:57:07,944 --> 00:57:11,253
<b>You're curious
what's inside the body, right?</b>

613
00:57:11,573 --> 00:57:12,732
<b>No.</b>

614
00:57:12,854 --> 00:57:16,956
<b>It's not bad to have the urge
to dissect.</b>

615
00:57:19,618 --> 00:57:21,541
<b>It's because you're a genius.</b>

616
00:57:22,565 --> 00:57:25,443
<b>Do you know what a genius is?</b>

617
00:57:26,893 --> 00:57:28,213
<b>You have the DNA...</b>

618
00:57:28,213 --> 00:57:31,256
<b>of the upper one percent
of the top doctors.</b>

619
00:57:34,853 --> 00:57:36,685
<b>My son is different indeed.</b>

620
00:57:37,534 --> 00:57:39,580
<b>Other kids your age...</b>

621
00:57:39,580 --> 00:57:42,574
<b>only know how to cry in funerals.</b>

622
00:57:43,143 --> 00:57:44,453
<b>I'm curious.</b>

623
00:57:44,963 --> 00:57:47,133
<b>Sure.</b>

624
00:57:47,133 --> 00:57:48,530
<b>That's okay.</b>

625
00:57:48,901 --> 00:57:51,456
<b>Grandpa was a pastor.</b>

626
00:57:51,456 --> 00:57:52,526
<b>- Right.
- I want to know...</b>

627
00:57:52,528 --> 00:57:54,063
<b>if there is
such a thing as a soul...</b>

628
00:57:54,651 --> 00:57:57,294
<b>and if Grandpa will be resurrected.</b>

629
00:57:57,682 --> 00:58:00,831
<b>I want to know how he'll look
when he resurrects.</b>

630
00:58:01,252 --> 00:58:02,177
<b>What?</b>

<b>Okay, I'll be out soon.</b>

639
00:59:37,095 --> 00:59:38,271
<b>What's wrong with me?</b>

640
00:59:45,815 --> 00:59:46,780
<b>Why?</b>

<b>There is a timing for each destiny.</b>

<b>When that time comes,
someone will find me...</b>
