1
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:09,940
<b>Mom.</b>

2
00:00:11,209 --> 00:00:12,839
<b>Song Na Hee. You...</b>

3
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:18,556
<b>What is with the state
of this entrance?</b>

4
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:20,325
<b>Shoes are flying everywhere!</b>

5
00:00:20,349 --> 00:00:21,689
<b>Gosh, what a mess.</b>

6
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:23,966
<b>How many times have I told you...</b>

7
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:25,750
<b>that a tidy entrance
brings luck to the home?</b>

8
00:00:26,089 --> 00:00:28,629
<b>- Unbelievable.
- Mother, let me.</b>

9
00:00:28,989 --> 00:00:30,605
<b>Gyu Jin, it's all right. I'll do it.</b>

10
00:00:30,629 --> 00:00:32,859
<b>Oh, please.
Of course it should be me.</b>

11
00:00:33,559 --> 00:00:36,670
<b>You sure know how
to clean up, don't you?</b>

12
00:00:41,509 --> 00:00:42,539
<b>Anyway,</b>

13
00:00:44,609 --> 00:00:46,616
<b>I thought you said you were too busy
to pick up the food I made,</b>

14
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,885
<b>so how come you're both here?</b>

15
00:00:47,909 --> 00:00:49,385
<b>My schedule got moved around.</b>

16
00:00:49,409 --> 00:00:50,926
<b>My meeting got pushed back too.</b>

17
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:53,979
<b>If I had known that,
I would've made you come by.</b>

18
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:58,359
<b>Here.</b>

19
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:00,296
<b>It's young radish kimchi.</b>

20
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,866
<b>Scoop up a decent amount
every time you enjoy it.</b>

21
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:06,835
<b>The cucumber kimchi
has been sliced and ready to eat.</b>

22
00:01:06,859 --> 00:01:09,329
<b>- Here you go.
- You really didn't have to.</b>

23
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,709
<b>My goodness!
Why is the fridge empty?</b>

24
00:01:16,469 --> 00:01:18,180
<b>Do you even cook at home?</b>

25
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:21,316
<b>We're busy all the time,
so we eat outside.</b>

26
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:23,680
<b>You should at least
cook breakfast though.</b>

27
00:01:24,109 --> 00:01:26,079
<b>Gosh, the boiled chicken
is still here.</b>

28
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:29,549
<b>Why didn't you peel the meat off
and make porridge at least?</b>

29
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:31,266
<b>It makes a perfect breakfast.</b>

30
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:35,066
<b>Mother, let me put this
in the fridge first.</b>

31
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:36,706
<b>Goodness. Thank you so much.</b>

32
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:39,329
<b>Na Hee, come on.
Offer her something to drink.</b>

33
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:40,700
<b>Right.</b>

34
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:45,200
<b>Don't skip breakfast, okay?
It's bad for your stomach.</b>

35
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,079
<b>You know that your brother
opened a stunt company, right?</b>

36
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:55,379
<b>According to him,
a major investor came forward.</b>

37
00:01:55,549 --> 00:01:57,355
<b>That's amazing!</b>

38
00:01:57,379 --> 00:02:00,025
<b>A major investor?
Are you sure it isn't illegal?</b>

39
00:02:00,049 --> 00:02:01,426
<b>Please tell me
he vet the investor at least.</b>

40
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:02,790
<b>You and your suspicions again.</b>

41
00:02:03,019 --> 00:02:04,665
<b>Give your brother some credit.</b>

42
00:02:04,689 --> 00:02:07,319
<b>She's just like
her father sometimes.</b>

43
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:09,266
<b>It's times like this
when I'm grateful for the fact...</b>

44
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:11,010
<b>that she was able to marry
someone like you.</b>

45
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:13,959
<b>Why would you put it like that, Mom?</b>

46
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:21,509
<b>Mother!</b>

47
00:02:21,939 --> 00:02:23,485
<b>Let me drive you home.</b>

48
00:02:23,509 --> 00:02:26,385
<b>That's not necessary at all.
The bus ride isn't that long.</b>

49
00:02:26,409 --> 00:02:28,756
<b>It makes me uncomfortable too.
Go inside and get some rest.</b>

50
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:30,580
<b>I'm not tired at all.</b>

51
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:32,455
<b>Of course you are.</b>

52
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:35,550
<b>I can see the bags under your eyes.</b>

53
00:02:36,219 --> 00:02:38,990
<b>Eat the kimchi I made
and don't skip breakfast.</b>

54
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:40,365
<b>And let me know once you eat it all.</b>

55
00:02:40,389 --> 00:02:43,189
<b>I'll drop everything
and make some more.</b>

56
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,376
<b>Thank you. I'll enjoy it for sure.</b>

57
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,430
<b>Right.</b>

58
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,075
<b>Anyway, head back inside.</b>

59
00:02:48,099 --> 00:02:50,069
<b>You should wash up
and get some sleep.</b>

60
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,945
<b>There's no need to see me off.</b>

61
00:02:54,969 --> 00:02:57,610
<b>I'll run if I have to.
Now, go back inside.</b>

62
00:02:57,909 --> 00:02:59,610
<b>Gosh, please don't run.</b>

63
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,509
<b>Goodnight, Mother!</b>

64
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:04,485
<b>Hurry back inside.
I'll see you around.</b>

65
00:03:04,509 --> 00:03:05,520
<b>Goodnight.</b>

66
00:03:17,889 --> 00:03:19,635
<b>I told you going after her
was a waste of time.</b>

67
00:03:19,659 --> 00:03:21,229
<b>You know how stubborn she is.</b>

68
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,469
<b>Hold on.
My mom could come back at any time,</b>

69
00:03:27,699 --> 00:03:29,586
<b>so let's not put this up.
You've memorized it all,</b>

70
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:30,710
<b>right?</b>

71
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:33,009
<b>How long must we keep this up?</b>

72
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:37,026
<b>Until when must we
keep our divorce a secret...</b>

73
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,479
<b>and deceive our parents?</b>

74
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:40,180
<b>Our divorce has been finalized,</b>

75
00:03:41,849 --> 00:03:44,289
<b>and I can't go along
with this anymore.</b>

76
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:47,990
<b>I can't look at your mom
without feeling guilty.</b>

77
00:03:48,289 --> 00:03:49,629
<b>Then what?</b>

78
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:51,699
<b>You want to come clean?</b>

79
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,259
<b>They'll find out someday anyway.</b>

80
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:56,900
<b>Did you see the look
on my mom's face today?</b>

81
00:03:57,129 --> 00:03:59,089
<b>She hasn't been at ease like this
for a long time.</b>

82
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:02,145
<b>She's just getting over
the shock of Da Hee's annulment,</b>

83
00:04:02,169 --> 00:04:03,740
<b>so how can we throw
this bomb at her?</b>

84
00:04:04,569 --> 00:04:06,210
<b>"Mom, I'm sorry,"</b>

85
00:04:06,539 --> 00:04:09,110
<b>"but our marriage
has been way over."</b>

86
00:04:09,409 --> 00:04:11,656
<b>"We didn't tell you
to save you from losing it."</b>

87
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,750
<b>Like that?</b>

88
00:04:14,419 --> 00:04:16,650
<b>My mom might want to commit suicide.</b>

89
00:04:19,659 --> 00:04:22,259
<b>I won't drag this on for too long.</b>

90
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:24,766
<b>Let's tell our parents
once we sell this house...</b>

91
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:26,110
<b>and we each find a place to stay.</b>

92
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:44,110
<b>How long must we keep this up?</b>

93
00:04:44,379 --> 00:04:46,196

<b>- Hi.
- It's good to see you.</b>

<b>Right.</b>

<b>I can't believe you needed

<b>What's it to you?</b>

126

00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,206
<b>Oh, it's you again.</b>

155
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:44,389
<b>We haven't even
opened yet, you know.</b>

156
00:07:44,459 --> 00:07:46,500
<b>I'm a busy man myself.</b>

157
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:48,675
<b>This is an application for joining
the merchant association.</b>

158
00:07:48,699 --> 00:07:51,406
<b>You'll be able to join
if the majority agrees.</b>

159
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:52,470
<b>Here.</b>

160
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:56,370
<b>The merchant association?</b>

161
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:04,086
<b>We're here on behalf
of the merchant association,</b>

162
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:06,019
<b>so we'll take 10 rolls of kimbap.</b>

163
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,526
<b>10 rolls of kimbap to go?</b>

164
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:10,649
<b>10 rolls of kimbap to go!</b>

165
00:08:11,649 --> 00:08:14,389
<b>Must one join
the merchant association though?</b>

166
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:17,389
<b>It's best if you do.</b>

167
00:08:17,589 --> 00:08:19,435
<b>For 30 dollars a year,</b>

168
00:08:19,459 --> 00:08:21,036
<b>the association will support
any events,</b>

169
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,476
<b>the use of parking lots,</b>

170
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,005
<b>and group purchase of groceries...</b>

171
00:08:24,029 --> 00:08:26,399
<b>Got it.
I guess I should sign up then.</b>

172
00:08:26,569 --> 00:08:27,939
<b>Just a second.</b>

173
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:33,879
<b>Would you like to taste one
while you're waiting?</b>

174
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:37,779
<b>Why would I ever decline?
Thanks in advance.</b>

175
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:42,019
<b>The piece at the end.</b>

176
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:46,120
<b>How is it?</b>

177
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:53,559
<b>The flavors are unique for a kimbap.</b>

178
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:58,769
<b>If I can, I'll cut the order
down to five rolls.</b>

179
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:03,169
<b>(Unnie's Kimbap)</b>

180
00:09:04,009 --> 00:09:06,710
<b>It's really hard
to make bland kimbap.</b>

181
00:09:07,509 --> 00:09:10,586
<b>How can it taste this bad
with all the proper ingredients?</b>

182
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:12,320
<b>That sure is another type of talent.</b>

183
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:14,750
<b>Born in 1969?</b>

184
00:09:14,779 --> 00:09:16,690
<b>Then she's 2 years younger
than Young Suk.</b>

185
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,265
<b>What are you muttering over there?
Is something wrong?</b>

186
00:09:19,289 --> 00:09:22,389
<b>No, I was just reminded
of my late sister, that's all.</b>

187
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:24,529
<b>Your sister?
Why did you bring her up?</b>

188
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:27,000
<b>She just popped into my head,
that's all.</b>

189
00:09:27,629 --> 00:09:30,706
<b>Gosh, she has terrible handwriting.</b>

190
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:32,846
<b>What do we do with these
rolls of kimbap?</b>

191
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:34,015
<b>I shouldn't throw these away, right?</b>

192
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:35,570
<b>You bought them, so finish them off.</b>

193
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:39,686
<b>This I can be certain of.
That President Song?</b>

194
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:43,379
<b>I already feel bad
for his wife and kids.</b>

195
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:45,755
<b>What a grumpy old man.</b>

196
00:09:45,779 --> 00:09:48,255
<b>He still came by
to make our first sale though.</b>

197
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:50,525
<b>It wasn't him. It was his friend.</b>

198
00:09:50,549 --> 00:09:54,519
<b>Cho Yeon, you lowered your age by
two years on the form, didn't you?</b>

199
00:09:54,659 --> 00:09:56,429
<b>I saw it.</b>

200
00:09:56,789 --> 00:09:59,275
<b>Must you do that
when it's just a couple of years?</b>

201
00:09:59,299 --> 00:10:00,535
<b>You'll get arrested again.</b>

202
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:02,500
<b>Shut it, you cows.</b>

203
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:05,740
<b>You'll know when you reach my age.
Those few years are darn precious.</b>

204
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,375
<b>Besides, who would believe
that I was born in 1967?</b>

205
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,070
<b>People think I'm still
in my early 40s.</b>

206
00:10:11,409 --> 00:10:13,409
<b>Says who? My gosh.</b>

207
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,196
<b>His breathing sounds a lot better...</b>

208
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,850
<b>and his oxygen saturation is higher.</b>

209
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:25,490
<b>Are you keeping up with
your nebulizer therapy?</b>

210
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:27,519
<b>Yes, I'm not coughing anymore.</b>

211
00:10:28,289 --> 00:10:31,336
<b>I'm sorry to tell you this,
but you can't go home yet though.</b>

212
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,700
<b>And even when you do,</b>

213
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:34,676
<b>you can't solely rely on
Ventolin either.</b>

214
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,570
<b>- When you start gasping...
- I know.</b>

215
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:39,145
<b>I should drop my shoulders,
let my arms droop,</b>

216
00:10:39,169 --> 00:10:41,240
<b>and breathe through my nose slowly.</b>

217
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:43,250
<b>You're a clever one, aren't you?</b>

218
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:46,639
<b>If you have the time, can you
treat my patients in my place?</b>

219
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:51,210
<b>Get some rest then.</b>

220
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:55,120
<b>I'll decide if he can go home
in a few days.</b>

221
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:58,419
<b>Just know that I'll be
checking his lungs tomorrow.</b>

222
00:10:58,490 --> 00:10:59,467
<b>Right.</b>

223
00:10:59,491 --> 00:11:00,990
<b>He's a clever little boy.</b>

224
00:11:02,129 --> 00:11:04,159
<b>I'm grateful
he doesn't take after me.</b>

225
00:11:05,129 --> 00:11:06,460
<b>Excuse me, Doctor?</b>

226
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:08,707
<b>Yes?</b>

227
00:11:08,731 --> 00:11:11,029
<b>You're Gyu Jin's wife, right?</b>

228
00:11:11,269 --> 00:11:13,139
<b>I heard from the nurse.</b>

229
00:11:13,669 --> 00:11:14,970
<b>I see.</b>

230
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,769
<b>We used to go to the same church...</b>

231
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:20,586
<b>although I couldn't make it
to your wedding.</b>

232
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:21,779
<b>Church?</b>

233
00:11:22,309 --> 00:11:23,350
<b>Yes.</b>

234
00:11:23,909 --> 00:11:26,326
<b>You and Gyu Jin make a great couple.</b>

235
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:27,750
<b>You're stunning too.</b>

236
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:32,620
<b>Gosh, thank you. I'll see you, then.</b>

237
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:36,389
<b>Shouldn't there be more customers?</b>

238
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:38,206
<b>Restaurants normally do well
on the day of the opening.</b>

239
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:41,405
<b>Tell me about it.
There's nothing to be heard here...</b>

240
00:11:41,429 --> 00:11:43,375
<b>except for the sound of flies.</b>

241
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:45,615
<b>Just be patient, girls.</b>

242
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:47,615
<b>News hasn't traveled
about our diner yet...</b>

243
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:49,546
<b>and there's a timing for everything.</b>

244
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:51,010
<b>We'll seize the moment
when it comes,</b>

245
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:53,309
<b>so stop thinking like
this is our last day.</b>

246
00:11:57,549 --> 00:12:00,919
<b>Guys, the timing has come. Start.</b>

247
00:12:01,049 --> 00:12:02,049
<b>What?</b>

248
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:07,490
<b>Hey, is this that new kimbap place?</b>

249
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:10,429
<b>I'm craving for some.
Should we go in?</b>

250
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:12,600
<b>What if the kimbap isn't good?</b>

251
00:12:12,659 --> 00:12:15,100
<b>Let's get
the sweet and sour chicken instead.</b>

252
00:12:15,929 --> 00:12:18,605
<b>You think? Okay, let's go.</b>

253
00:12:18,629 --> 00:12:21,946
<b>My goodness.
Hello, you handsome young men.</b>

254
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:24,216
<b>- Do you go to the nearby school?
- Yes.</b>

255
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,515
<b>We just opened today,
so sodas are for free.</b>

256
00:12:27,539 --> 00:12:28,740
<b>Why don't you come in?</b>

257
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:32,495
<b>My gosh, is it hot out here?
You're sweating.</b>

258
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:34,655
<b>Let me turn on the fan for you.</b>

259
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:36,720
<b>- Come in.
- Come on.</b>

260
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:51,105
<b>Here are your fans.</b>

261
00:12:51,129 --> 00:12:52,476
<b>So, how do they taste?</b>

262
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,669
<b>- Good.
- Good.</b>

263
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:56,186
<b>- Here are your free sodas.
- Thank you.</b>

264
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:57,639
<b>Enjoy.</b>

265
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,980
<b>You guys must not get
good grades at school though.</b>

266
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:05,995
<b>Why else would your backpacks
be that empty?</b>

267
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:09,289
<b>Who on earth carries
books around in their backpacks?</b>

268
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:12,566
<b>Books are only needed
as a pillow at school.</b>

269
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:14,389
<b>- Aren't I right?
- That's right.</b>

270
00:13:17,889 --> 00:13:18,960
<b>They're so pretty.</b>

271
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:21,129
<b>They're beautiful.</b>

272
00:13:22,629 --> 00:13:26,169
<b>I wonder which one would be best.</b>

273
00:13:37,009 --> 00:13:39,625
<b>We used to go to the same church...</b>

274
00:13:39,649 --> 00:13:42,590
<b>although I couldn't make it
to your wedding.</b>

275
00:13:43,149 --> 00:13:44,950
<b>It's her, right?</b>

276
00:13:48,659 --> 00:13:50,235
<b>Look at how cute you were
in high school.</b>

277
00:13:50,259 --> 00:13:51,929
<b>You look the same,</b>

278
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,905
<b>but just in a more adorable way.</b>

279
00:13:53,929 --> 00:13:55,745
<b>Wasn't my nose sharper though?</b>

280
00:13:55,769 --> 00:13:57,370
<b>It makes you want to
bite down on it.</b>

281
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:00,000
<b>Wait.</b>

282
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:01,840
<b>Who's she?</b>

283
00:14:02,039 --> 00:14:04,245
<b>You seem shy in a way.</b>

284
00:14:04,269 --> 00:14:05,485
<b>What?</b>

285
00:14:05,509 --> 00:14:07,539
<b>Well, she's just my first love.</b>

286
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,686
<b>We just went to the same church,
that's all.</b>

287
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:11,285
<b>Anyway, let's sleep.</b>

288
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:14,480
<b>What did you just say?
Your first love?</b>

289
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,025
<b>She's your first love?</b>

290
00:14:16,049 --> 00:14:17,265
<b>- Your first love?
- Wait.</b>

291
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:18,960
<b>No, I mean...</b>

292
00:14:27,129 --> 00:14:29,769
<b>That acquaintance of yours.
Si Hoo's mother, I mean.</b>

293
00:14:32,899 --> 00:14:33,940
<b>What about her?</b>

294
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,710
<b>She's your first love, right?
The one from church.</b>

295
00:14:39,509 --> 00:14:42,009
<b>First love, my foot.</b>

296
00:14:42,809 --> 00:14:44,450
<b>I'll take that as a yes.</b>

297
00:14:45,179 --> 00:14:48,480
<b>I remembered her face
from the photo I once saw.</b>

298
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:55,360
<b>Gosh, unbelievable.</b>

299
00:14:55,759 --> 00:14:58,190
<b>I hate her good memory sometimes.</b>

300
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:00,505
<b>Si Hoo's breathing is a lot better.</b>

301
00:15:00,529 --> 00:15:02,370
<b>He might be going home
in a few days.</b>

302
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,070
<b>Anyway,</b>

303
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:07,200
<b>How do you feel to meet
your first love again?</b>

304
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,846
<b>You must be thrilled.</b>

305
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:10,916
<b>Don't be silly.
She has a seven-year-old son.</b>

306
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:13,186
<b>It was a long time ago.</b>

307
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:15,080
<b>Can't you feel thrilled
to see a married woman?</b>

308
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:18,350
<b>Why are you overreacting like that?</b>

309
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:21,419
<b>I guess you were really into her.</b>

310
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,620
<b>Gosh, you're even blushing now.</b>

311
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:27,419
<b>I do have a healthy complexion
for no reason.</b>

312
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:31,129
<b>I'm just healthy.
What's wrong about that?</b>

313
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:33,830
<b>Why does he seem so flustered?</b>

314
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,870
<b>He really must've been thrilled.</b>

315
00:15:38,669 --> 00:15:39,669
<b>Na Hee.</b>

316
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,076
<b>We have about 20 minutes left
for the lunch break.</b>

317
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:44,240
<b>Would you have some tea with me?</b>

318
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:51,750
<b>Let me see.
The one you found online is...</b>

319
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:53,049
<b>It's right here.</b>

320
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:55,096
<b>It's close to a subway station
and a park.</b>

321
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,796
<b>The deposit is 100,000 dollars
and a monthly rent of 1,200 dollars.</b>

322
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:57,850
<b>What? 100,000 dollars?</b>

323
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:06,799
<b>It doesn't have to be close
to a subway station.</b>

324
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,680
<b>- Do you want something else?
- Yes, please.</b>

325
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,070
<b>What about this one?</b>

326
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:14,940
<b>It's a little far from the station,
but the air is really good.</b>

327
00:16:15,269 --> 00:16:17,550
<b>The deposit is 60,000 dollars
and the rent is 800 dollars.</b>

328
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,639
<b>The air doesn't have to be so good.</b>

329
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,809
<b>We all have healthy
bronchial tubes.</b>

330
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:31,620
<b>What about this then?
It's 50,000 and 700.</b>

331
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:34,190
<b>I don't know.</b>

332
00:16:34,419 --> 00:16:36,929
<b>What price are you looking for?</b>

333
00:16:40,129 --> 00:16:42,529
<b>(Thread factory)</b>

334
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,139
<b>This is it.</b>

335
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,546
<b>This is good enough
for 30,000 deposit and 500 rent.</b>

336
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:50,740
<b>It's a semi-basement.</b>

337
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:53,809
<b>What do you think?
Do you want to go inside?</b>

338
00:16:56,809 --> 00:16:58,179
<b>Yes, we do.</b>

339
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:01,549
<b>This is nice, Joon Seon.
And it's well-located.</b>

340
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:06,059
<b>- Take a look.
- Okay.</b>

341
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,090
<b>It's spacious.</b>

342
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:12,500
<b>Joon Seon,
this is bigger than I thought.</b>

343
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:14,559
<b>It's big enough for training.</b>

344
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:17,730
<b>I think so.
It's bigger than it looks.</b>

345
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,200
<b>But what about the light?
Can we turn the light on?</b>

346
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,509
<b>Of course. The light...</b>

347
00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:27,109
<b>It's not on, but it's okay.</b>

348
00:17:27,509 --> 00:17:28,555
<b>We can fix it.</b>

349
00:17:28,579 --> 00:17:30,480
<b>You know my nickname is MacGyver.</b>

350
00:17:33,579 --> 00:17:34,849
<b>- I can fix it.
- You think?</b>

351
00:17:35,319 --> 00:17:36,366
<b>What about ventilation?</b>

352
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:38,789
<b>Joon Seon, we can just open
the windows for ventilation.</b>

353
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:43,460
<b>Why is it stuck?</b>

354
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:47,275
<b>Hey, you're a stuntman.</b>

355
00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:49,170
<b>Can't you even open a window?
You little...</b>

356
00:17:49,299 --> 00:17:51,569
<b>It's okay, Joon Seon. I can fix it.</b>

357
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:53,869
<b>I will fix the windows
and the lights.</b>

358
00:17:54,269 --> 00:17:56,985
<b>Are you sure?
Can you really fix them all?</b>

359
00:17:57,009 --> 00:17:58,785
<b>Of course. Don't worry.</b>

360
00:17:58,809 --> 00:18:01,339
<b>I'll fix everything. Trust me.</b>

361
00:18:03,309 --> 00:18:05,485
<b>Are you sure this is okay
for our office?</b>

362
00:18:05,509 --> 00:18:06,926
<b>Yes. I like it.</b>

363
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:08,180
<b>I really love it.</b>

364
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,220
<b>We're going to have our own place.</b>

365
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:12,666
<b>I'm okay with any place
as long as it has a ceiling.</b>

366
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:14,370
<b>We can at least take
shelter from the rain.</b>

367
00:18:14,619 --> 00:18:17,390
<b>Should I really sign the lease?
Are you sure?</b>

368
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:19,089
<b>- Yes, Joon Seon.
- Sure.</b>

369
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,170
<b>All right. Let's sign it then.</b>

370
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:29,210
<b>Now we have our own office.</b>

371
00:18:32,609 --> 00:18:34,169
<b>How do you find
working at the hospital?</b>

372
00:18:34,539 --> 00:18:36,609
<b>You seem to be adapting
to it quite well.</b>

373
00:18:36,809 --> 00:18:38,150
<b>As you can see,</b>

374
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:39,995
<b>the only problem is
that I'm too popular.</b>

375
00:18:40,019 --> 00:18:42,589
<b>All the women in the hospital
are asking me out.</b>

376
00:18:42,819 --> 00:18:44,849
<b>They just won't leave me alone.</b>

377
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:47,366
<b>But you're having
a coffee break with me.</b>

378
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:49,230
<b>I took my time out for you.</b>

379
00:18:53,259 --> 00:18:54,500
<b>Well... Na Hee.</b>

380
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:57,200
<b>About your younger sister.</b>

381
00:18:57,730 --> 00:19:00,640
<b>Would you say she holds grudges
for a long time?</b>

382
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,740
<b>I don't know.</b>

383
00:19:03,269 --> 00:19:05,069
<b>She's quite mellow most of the time.</b>

384
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,680
<b>But once she gets upset,
she becomes quite stubborn.</b>

385
00:19:09,109 --> 00:19:11,085
<b>Why? Does she have
a problem with your mom?</b>

386
00:19:11,109 --> 00:19:12,856
<b>No. They actually
get along well together.</b>

387
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,920
<b>Your sister handles
my mom's temperament quite well.</b>

388
00:19:17,349 --> 00:19:19,859
<b>By the way, are you all right?</b>

389
00:19:20,059 --> 00:19:21,319
<b>Are things over with Gyu Jin?</b>

390
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:25,460
<b>It's a little uncomfortable,</b>

391
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:28,099
<b>but we have to wait
until our house is sold.</b>

392
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:30,630
<b>I hope Gyu Jin will leave
the hospital soon.</b>

393
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:32,176
<b>He had an interview
at Hanseo University.</b>

394
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,140
<b>He said he didn't
go to the interview.</b>

395
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,886
<b>What? What do you mean?</b>

396
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:39,116
<b>I don't know the details.
He just said he didn't go.</b>

397
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:42,116
<b>So Sang Hoon took the job.</b>

398
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:43,825
<b>You know the guy
from Saebit Hospital.</b>

399
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:45,249
<b>He went to the same college as you.</b>

400
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:50,750
<b>Yes?</b>

401
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:54,859
<b>Gosh, I'm startled.</b>

402
00:19:56,329 --> 00:19:59,329
<b>Did you not go to the interview
at Hanseo University?</b>

403
00:20:00,859 --> 00:20:01,859
<b>No.</b>

404
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,170
<b>Why not?</b>

405
00:20:04,299 --> 00:20:06,339
<b>I couldn't go
because of the situation here,</b>

406
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:07,876
<b>but at least you should have gone.</b>

407
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,980
<b>We can't keep working
at the same hospital like this.</b>

408
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:11,616
<b>Well... The thing is...</b>

409
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,279
<b>I don't know many people
at that hospital.</b>

410
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,085
<b>And I'll have to work
a longer shift there.</b>

411
00:20:17,109 --> 00:20:18,309
<b>Is that why you didn't go?</b>

412
00:20:19,349 --> 00:20:20,880
<b>That's it?</b>

413
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,690
<b>Yes.</b>

414
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:26,359
<b>This is crazy.
You know it's a great opportunity.</b>

415
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:28,335
<b>You're a man.
Don't you have any ambition?</b>

416
00:20:28,359 --> 00:20:29,606
<b>Will you work here forever...</b>

417
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:32,160
<b>hanging out with the director
and junior doctors?</b>

418
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:34,235
<b>No, it's not like that.</b>

419
00:20:34,259 --> 00:20:35,799
<b>You're always like this.</b>

420
00:20:36,269 --> 00:20:37,946
<b>You're a coward...</b>

421
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:40,299
<b>who just avoids problems
without facing them.</b>

422
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:41,569
<b>What?</b>

423
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:43,609
<b>Hey, whose fault was it that...</b>

424
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:47,609
<b>Forget it. Let's not do this.</b>

425
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,509
<b>Why? If you have something to say,
just spit it out.</b>

426
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:53,519
<b>I just can't understand you.</b>

427
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:56,866
<b>Are you okay with working
in the same hospital as me?</b>

428
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:59,025
<b>Of course, I'm not.</b>

429
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:01,065
<b>You always barge in
and pick a fight with me like this.</b>

430
00:21:01,089 --> 00:21:02,436
<b>Do you think I have
nothing else to do?</b>

431
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:04,106
<b>I'm doing this
because you make me upset.</b>

432
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:05,730
<b>That's it. I told you to stop.</b>

433
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,200
<b>Hey.</b>

434
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:10,545
<b>This is why we broke up.</b>

435
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:12,170
<b>You always see things
the way you want.</b>

436
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,575
<b>You just misunderstand others
and come to your own conclusion.</b>

437
00:21:14,599 --> 00:21:17,269
<b>I always miss the chance to explain.</b>

438
00:21:17,769 --> 00:21:18,929
<b>What's that supposed to mean?</b>

439
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,779
<b>I don't know. It's just...</b>

440
00:21:24,849 --> 00:21:25,910
<b>Get out.</b>

441
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:27,819
<b>I have to work. Get out.</b>

442
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:31,610
<b>We're so not right for each other.</b>

443
00:21:37,289 --> 00:21:38,359
<b>No, we're not.</b>

444
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:40,970
<b>We're not right for each other.</b>

445
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,269
<b>The door is open.</b>

446
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:55,940
<b>Gosh, I feel so uncomfortable.</b>

447
00:21:56,849 --> 00:21:58,980
<b>I shouldn't have acted up like that.</b>

448
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:05,690
<b>Welcome...</b>

449
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:11,960
<b>You're here.</b>

450
00:22:12,589 --> 00:22:14,000
<b>I was thirsty on my way home.</b>

451
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:15,876
<b>Can I have
a strawberry banana juice?</b>

452
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,400
<b>Okay. Take any seat you like.</b>

453
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:23,916
<b>Ms. Song, I should pay first.</b>

454
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:26,216
<b>I always keep my private
and public life separate.</b>

455
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,740
<b>One strawberry banana juice.
That will be 4.6 dollars.</b>

456
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:30,410
<b>Ms. Song.</b>

457
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:32,156
<b>Yes? Go ahead.</b>

458
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:34,220
<b>Why are you being like this?
You seem distant.</b>

459
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:36,426
<b>Just be comfortable around me.
I'm sorry for what I did.</b>

460
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:38,819
<b>Here's your card.
Please wait a moment.</b>

461
00:22:39,089 --> 00:22:41,319
<b>Ms. Song, please don't be like this.</b>

462
00:22:41,589 --> 00:22:43,690
<b>I didn't mean to tease you.</b>

463
00:22:44,589 --> 00:22:48,606
<b>All right. To be honest,
I tried to tease you a little.</b>

464
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:50,876
<b>But that's because
I found you very friendly.</b>

465
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:54,000
<b>I didn't do it to mean anything bad.
It was just an expression...</b>

466
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:01,079
<b>Here's your juice. Please enjoy.</b>

467
00:23:02,309 --> 00:23:05,250
<b>Stop acting so cold
and listen to me.</b>

468
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:07,220
<b>Ms. Song.</b>

469
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:10,549
<b>Ms. Song.</b>

470
00:23:11,549 --> 00:23:13,289
<b>You're back, Ms. Choi.</b>

471
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:15,960
<b>I've been seeing you here
quite often.</b>

472
00:23:16,329 --> 00:23:18,489
<b>I know. It just happened that way.
Where have you been?</b>

473
00:23:19,059 --> 00:23:20,130
<b>I got a massage.</b>

474
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,069
<b>Ms. Hong is having a charity bazaar
at her gallery tomorrow.</b>

475
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,805
<b>I haven't seen them
for a long time,</b>

476
00:23:24,829 --> 00:23:26,099
<b>so I don't want to look bad.</b>

477
00:23:26,569 --> 00:23:28,069
<b>Ms. Hong?</b>

478
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,860
<b>They are like
Choi Yun Jeong 1, 2, 3, and 4.</b>

479
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:35,186
<b>She met this group at the VIP lounge
of a department store.</b>

480
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:36,726
<b>It's as if there are four of my mom.</b>

481
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:38,456
<b>Doesn't it sound scary?</b>

482
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,726
<b>Ms. Choi, we need to order
disposable goods.</b>

483
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:43,226
<b>Our supplier has a new product,</b>

484
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:45,289
<b>so they suggested
we try a box for free.</b>

485
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:47,136
<b>Really? Let's do that.</b>

486
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,196
<b>Okay. We don't even
need cup sleeves with it.</b>

487
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:50,289
<b>It sounds convenient.</b>

488
00:23:53,259 --> 00:23:54,799
<b>Son, follow me.</b>

489
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,585
<b>All right.
This is my new business card.</b>

490
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:06,539
<b>My business card. Take one.</b>

491
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:10,880
<b>CEO Song Joon Seon
of Good Action.</b>

492
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:13,926
<b>The card is quite stiff.
It looks fancy.</b>

493
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:15,196
<b>I bet you spent
quite a bit of money on this.</b>

494
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:16,926
<b>Yes. I spent quite a sum on this.</b>

495
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:18,126
<b>You know a business card...</b>

496
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:19,960
<b>is like the face of a company.</b>

497
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:22,366
<b>You can get three boxes...</b>

498
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:24,359
<b>for five dollars at the printers
near the market.</b>

499
00:24:24,789 --> 00:24:26,275
<b>Why would you waste money
on things like that?</b>

500
00:24:26,299 --> 00:24:27,430
<b>There you go again.</b>

501
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:29,976
<b>Will you stop picking on him?</b>

502
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,745
<b>This is his first business card.
He can't get a cheap one.</b>

503
00:24:32,769 --> 00:24:33,815
<b>Gosh.</b>

504
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:36,116
<b>This is good.
A good business card will...</b>

505
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:37,710
<b>bring you good business.</b>

506
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,839
<b>So do you like your office?</b>

507
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:45,150
<b>Sure, of course.</b>

508
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:47,255
<b>I just found a perfect place.</b>

509
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:48,819
<b>It's just amazing.</b>

510
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:51,750
<b>The building is new,
and it has a spacious room.</b>

511
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,595
<b>Really? I'm so happy for you.</b>

512
00:24:54,619 --> 00:24:57,666
<b>It's easily accessible
and the building is well-designed.</b>

513
00:24:57,690 --> 00:25:00,876
<b>It's well ventilated
with the windows open.</b>

514
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,900
<b>I can't even tell
if I'm in a building or not.</b>

515
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:06,130
<b>I owe it all
to my honorable investor.</b>

516
00:25:06,299 --> 00:25:08,900
<b>Auntie. Have another slice.</b>

517
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:12,809
<b>Okay, Joon Seon. Thanks.</b>

518
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:17,325
<b>Can you please calm down
and not get carried away?</b>

519
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:19,525
<b>Do everything with caution, okay?</b>

520
00:25:19,549 --> 00:25:21,626
<b>Yes, don't worry, Dad.</b>

521
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:23,495
<b>So when is the opening ceremony?</b>

522
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:26,589
<b>I plan to order millet cakes
to celebrate.</b>

523
00:25:27,319 --> 00:25:31,265
<b>The opening ceremony?
I was hoping to skip that.</b>

524
00:25:31,289 --> 00:25:34,305
<b>Why? It's your first company.
You should hold a ritual.</b>

525
00:25:34,329 --> 00:25:35,535
<b>With a whole pig head.</b>

526
00:25:35,559 --> 00:25:38,505
<b>Why do you believe superstitions
when you're so young?</b>

527
00:25:38,529 --> 00:25:40,216
<b>I won't entrust
the future of my company...</b>

528
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,470
<b>to a pig head and red rice cakes.</b>

529
00:25:43,869 --> 00:25:45,686
<b>What are you talking about?</b>

530
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:48,815
<b>You locked the door after
I went to a funeral so I couldn't...</b>

531
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:50,509
<b>come in until you threw salt on me.</b>

532
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,926
<b>I had to wait
until I got a whole bowl over me.</b>

533
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:54,055
<b>Don't you remember?</b>

534
00:25:54,079 --> 00:25:55,119
<b>You're right.</b>

535
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:58,789
<b>Anyway, there's too much to do.
Later. Maybe later.</b>

536
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:00,859
<b>Skip it if you want.</b>

537
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:02,619
<b>I'm glad I won't have to
spend the cash.</b>

538
00:26:04,859 --> 00:26:06,190
<b>I should stop eating.</b>

539
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:08,805
<b>I'm meeting
my old attendant friends tomorrow.</b>

540
00:26:08,829 --> 00:26:11,069
<b>If I eat any more,
I'll puff up tomorrow.</b>

541
00:26:11,569 --> 00:26:13,569
<b>Should I peel more fruit or not?</b>

542
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,269
<b>Don't peel any more.</b>

543
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,410
<b>Most of the fruit's nutrients
are in the peel. Eat the peel.</b>

544
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,640
<b>Oh, my gosh. Honestly.</b>

545
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,785
<b>Isn't that dirty?</b>

546
00:26:23,809 --> 00:26:25,809
<b>Eat the peel. Go on.</b>

547
00:26:26,279 --> 00:26:27,279
<b>Okay.</b>

548
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:30,089
<b>Seo Jin, that must be Mom. Let's go.</b>

549
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:32,450
<b>- Here.
- Thanks.</b>

550
00:26:33,289 --> 00:26:36,765
<b>I made young radish kimchi
for Na Hee and packed some for you.</b>

551
00:26:36,789 --> 00:26:38,636
<b>With a few other side dishes.</b>

552
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:40,075
<b>Thank you, Mother.</b>

553
00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:42,906
<b>My fridge is bare,
so I can't even refuse.</b>

554
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:45,000
<b>Mom, you should've packed
some anchovies.</b>

555
00:26:45,029 --> 00:26:46,299
<b>Seo Jin loves them.</b>

556
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,170
<b>I did already, you fool.</b>

557
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:53,485
<b>I'm sure you heard, didn't you?</b>

558
00:26:53,509 --> 00:26:55,880
<b>That he started a business.</b>

559
00:26:56,109 --> 00:26:57,755
<b>He rented an office today,</b>

560
00:26:57,779 --> 00:27:00,680
<b>and he says it's nice and spacious
and in a new building.</b>

561
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,089
<b>Is it? That's great.</b>

562
00:27:03,849 --> 00:27:06,319
<b>I went to a fortune-teller once...</b>

563
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:09,359
<b>who said that
Joon Seon is a late bloomer.</b>

564
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:15,500
<b>I used to feel so frustrated
and almost sick when I saw him,</b>

565
00:27:15,799 --> 00:27:18,299
<b>but now I guess things are
beginning to work out.</b>

566
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,716
<b>Even my appetite came back.</b>

567
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:23,386
<b>Why would you say that?
She'll feel uncomfortable.</b>

568
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:25,485
<b>I suggested he host
an opening ceremony,</b>

569
00:27:25,509 --> 00:27:27,279
<b>but he keeps on refusing.</b>

570
00:27:27,509 --> 00:27:31,049
<b>He wants to save the money
and invest it in the business.</b>

571
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,656
<b>He has finally grown up.</b>

572
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,156
<b>Mom, go back inside.</b>

573
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:37,025
<b>Okay, I was just saying.</b>

574
00:27:37,049 --> 00:27:38,896
<b>Anyway, drive home safely.</b>

575
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,896
<b>Put the kimchi
in the fridge right away.</b>

576
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,035
<b>- Okay?
- Yes, Mother.</b>

577
00:27:42,059 --> 00:27:44,505
<b>Seo Jin, Grandma has to go. Goodbye.</b>

578
00:27:44,529 --> 00:27:45,506
<b>- Bye.
- Bye.</b>

579
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:46,805
<b>- Go.
- Okay, okay.</b>

580
00:27:46,829 --> 00:27:47,829
<b>It's cold.</b>

581
00:27:50,569 --> 00:27:51,829
<b>Here you go.</b>

582
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:54,869
<b>I put aside the first one for you.</b>

583
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:00,579
<b>It looks nice. I like the name too.</b>

584
00:28:02,609 --> 00:28:04,129
<b>Why won't you have
an opening ceremony?</b>

585
00:28:04,549 --> 00:28:07,319
<b>Mother wants to invite
the market people to brag.</b>

586
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:09,825
<b>That's a good thing too.</b>

587
00:28:09,849 --> 00:28:12,190
<b>Giving your parents
something to brag about.</b>

588
00:28:12,349 --> 00:28:14,295
<b>Yes, but I'm busy.</b>

589
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:16,319
<b>It's early days
and there's a lot to do.</b>

590
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:20,359
<b>I should show Seo Young this.</b>

591
00:28:21,259 --> 00:28:23,299
<b>She'll be so pleased
that her dad is a CEO.</b>

592
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:25,700
<b>What about you?</b>

593
00:28:26,569 --> 00:28:27,569
<b>What?</b>

594
00:28:27,799 --> 00:28:30,716
<b>I mean... No, never mind.</b>

595
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:33,255
<b>Seo Jin must be sleepy.
Let's get her home.</b>

596
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:35,240
<b>- Okay.
- Let's go, Seo Jin.</b>

597
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:37,809
<b>Take care, Seo Jin. Bye.</b>

598
00:28:38,549 --> 00:28:39,819
<b>Drive safely!</b>

599
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:42,750
<b>Bye!</b>

600
00:28:45,049 --> 00:28:46,220
<b>Goodbye.</b>

601
00:28:48,019 --> 00:28:50,466
<b>You moron. Why couldn't you ask?</b>

602
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:52,565
<b>Why couldn't you say,
"Aren't you pleased?"</b>

603
00:28:52,589 --> 00:28:54,436
<b>You're such a loser.</b>

604
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:56,775
<b>You're even less than
young radish kimchi.</b>

605

<b>I brought some blankets from home,</b>

<b>so I guess lunch should be on me.</b>

914

<b>Actually, it'll be on me.</b>

<b>Ga Hee, isn't this a bit too much?</b>

921

<b>- Ga Hee, thanks for the meal.
- Gosh, this is nothing.</b>

<b>Are you kidding me?</b>

944

1061
00:54:13,140 --> 00:54:15,009
<b>How does she do that?</b>

1062
00:54:18,539 --> 00:54:21,156
<b>Hey, you idiot.
What are you doing here?</b>

1063
00:54:21,180 --> 00:54:22,157
<b>- My gosh.
- Follow me.</b>

1064
00:54:22,181 --> 00:54:23,495
<b>What's happening?</b>

1065
00:54:23,519 --> 00:54:25,295
<b>- Come here.
- What...</b>

1066
00:54:25,319 --> 00:54:26,926
<b>What's wrong with her?</b>

1067
00:54:26,950 --> 00:54:29,095
<b>Let go of it.
You're pulling out my hair.</b>

1068
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:31,035
<b>Do you want me to go bald?</b>

1069
00:54:31,059 --> 00:54:33,305
<b>Shut it. Who cares if you go bald?
Just follow me.</b>

1070
00:54:33,329 --> 00:54:34,735
<b>Let go of my hair.</b>

1071
00:54:34,759 --> 00:54:38,329
<b>Gosh, ma'am.
I guess there's a misunderstanding.</b>

1072
00:54:38,430 --> 00:54:40,206
<b>Please calm down.</b>

1073
00:54:40,230 --> 00:54:42,315
<b>Misunderstanding, my foot.
Just stay out of this.</b>

1074
00:54:42,339 --> 00:54:44,616
<b>Gosh, you can't leave like this.</b>

1075
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:46,970
<b>- Let's go inside and talk.
- Let go of him.</b>

1076
00:54:47,670 --> 00:54:50,980
<b>You'd just do anything for money.
How vulgar you are.</b>

1077
00:54:51,140 --> 00:54:53,279
<b>What kind of people are you?</b>

1078
00:54:53,809 --> 00:54:56,495
<b>- Let's go.
- I just went there to eat kimbap.</b>

1079
00:54:56,519 --> 00:54:58,126
<b>- Don't be ridiculous.
- Don't do this.</b>

1080
00:54:58,150 --> 00:55:00,890
<b>Vulgar? What did she say?</b>

1081
00:55:01,150 --> 00:55:04,960
<b>What a nasty wench.</b>

1082
00:55:11,529 --> 00:55:13,200
<b>Should I go in there
and talk to her?</b>

1083
00:55:15,369 --> 00:55:18,170
<b>I'll just skip it today. I'm tired.</b>

1084
00:55:27,579 --> 00:55:31,480
<b>I always love
how you've decorated your place.</b>

1085
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:35,396
<b>By the way, what's that painting?</b>

1086
00:55:35,420 --> 00:55:37,160
<b>I don't know the artist.</b>

1087
00:55:38,190 --> 00:55:39,990
<b>It's a painting by a new artist.</b>

1088
00:55:40,230 --> 00:55:43,259
<b>I like simple paintings
like that these days.</b>

1089
00:55:43,730 --> 00:55:47,345
<b>I like the uniform effects
of light and shade.</b>

1090
00:55:47,369 --> 00:55:49,700
<b>And yet, it's not so conventional.</b>

1091
00:55:50,140 --> 00:55:51,876
<b>- I see.
- I agree.</b>

1092
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:54,140
<b>- That's very nice.
- I love it too.</b>

1093
00:55:55,170 --> 00:55:57,579
<b>By the way,
when is your second son coming?</b>

1094
00:56:01,049 --> 00:56:04,726
<b>Gosh, those ladies never change.</b>

1095
00:56:04,750 --> 00:56:06,350
<b>I feel drained
just at the sight of them.</b>

1096
00:56:06,650 --> 00:56:08,265
<b>Ms. Song,
I'll stay here for a while.</b>

1097
00:56:08,289 --> 00:56:09,789
<b>Only until the guests leave.</b>

1098
00:56:12,119 --> 00:56:15,559
<b>Gosh, you're now treating me
like I'm invisible.</b>

1099
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:17,859
<b>You hold grudges for too long.</b>

1100
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:23,140
<b>I said I'm sorry.
Will you please accept my apology?</b>

1101
00:56:24,799 --> 00:56:25,809
<b>Ms. Song.</b>

1102
00:56:26,539 --> 00:56:28,170
<b>Can't you see me? Hey...</b>

1103
00:56:30,380 --> 00:56:33,049
<b>You see me, right? Ms. Song.</b>

1104
00:56:34,150 --> 00:56:37,325
<b>Okay. You're unbelievable.
I have to admit it.</b>

1105
00:56:37,349 --> 00:56:38,680
<b>Okay. I give up.</b>

1106
00:56:47,390 --> 00:56:50,400
<b>Ms. Song, I'm really sorry.</b>

1107
00:56:54,130 --> 00:56:55,400
<b>Song Da Hee.</b>

1108
00:57:02,140 --> 00:57:05,779
<b>Okay. I really give up.
Take care and have a good life.</b>

1109
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:09,079
<b>Where did I put it?</b>

1110
00:57:09,549 --> 00:57:12,420
<b>Ms. Song,
I'm not here, okay? Please.</b>

1111
00:57:16,289 --> 00:57:18,765
<b>Ms. Song, you should close up now.</b>

1112
00:57:18,789 --> 00:57:21,535
<b>Okay. Let me finish cleaning first.
Do you need anything?</b>

1113
00:57:21,559 --> 00:57:24,305
<b>Yes. I can't find my wine anywhere.</b>

1114
00:57:24,329 --> 00:57:26,005
<b>I guess I left it here.</b>

1115
00:57:26,029 --> 00:57:29,116
<b>It has a white label on it.
Can you check the fridge?</b>

1116
00:57:29,140 --> 00:57:30,539
<b>Okay. Please wait.</b>

1117
00:57:33,710 --> 00:57:34,970
<b>Move over.</b>

1118
00:57:35,710 --> 00:57:37,380
<b>I told you to move over.</b>

1119
00:57:38,180 --> 00:57:39,609
<b>Who are you talking to?</b>

1120
00:57:42,980 --> 00:57:43,980
<b>Gosh.</b>

1121
00:57:46,589 --> 00:57:49,019
<b>Jae Seok, what are you doing there?</b>

1122
00:57:51,519 --> 00:57:52,529
<b>Mom.</b>

1123
00:57:55,329 --> 00:57:59,035
<b>Mom. I was a little thirsty.</b>

1124
00:57:59,059 --> 00:58:01,646
<b>There's water in here.
There's no water.</b>

1125
00:58:01,670 --> 00:58:05,116
<b>Hey, my friends were
waiting for you.</b>

1126
00:58:05,140 --> 00:58:06,186
<b>Come on.</b>

1127
00:58:06,210 --> 00:58:08,386
<b>Mom, I'm a little tired today.</b>

1128
00:58:08,410 --> 00:58:09,815
<b>Ms. Choi, is this it?</b>

1129
00:58:09,839 --> 00:58:12,180
<b>Yes. This is it.</b>

1130
00:58:15,009 --> 00:58:17,726
<b>What are you doing?
Let's go. My friends are waiting.</b>

1131
00:58:17,750 --> 00:58:19,765
<b>Mom, I just can't deal with...</b>

1132
00:58:19,789 --> 00:58:22,089
<b>Just go say hello. Let's go.</b>

1133
00:58:22,420 --> 00:58:24,720
<b>Let's go, son.</b>

1134
00:58:25,220 --> 00:58:26,660
<b>Bye.</b>

1135
00:58:35,029 --> 00:58:36,440
<b>Eat slowly.</b>

1136
00:58:39,269 --> 00:58:41,009
<b>And have some water.</b>

1137
00:58:42,210 --> 00:58:43,279
<b>Here.</b>

1138
00:58:47,980 --> 00:58:48,957
<b>Is it good?</b>

1139
00:58:48,981 --> 00:58:51,279
<b>Yes. It's a lot better than
hospital food.</b>

1140
00:58:53,390 --> 00:58:54,450
<b>We have some fruit too.</b>

1141
00:58:57,490 --> 00:58:59,666
<b>Hey, you're eating dinner.</b>

1142
00:58:59,690 --> 00:59:00,730
<b>Yes.</b>

1143
00:59:01,130 --> 00:59:05,029
<b>My son wanted to eat
my fried tofu rice balls.</b>

1144
00:59:05,259 --> 00:59:08,400
<b>Si Hoo, say hello.
This doctor is my friend.</b>

1145
00:59:10,099 --> 00:59:11,616
<b>Hello.</b>

1146
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:12,809
<b>Hello, Si Hoo.</b>

1147
00:59:13,009 --> 00:59:15,509
<b>You're so handsome
since you take after your mom.</b>

1148
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:17,785
<b>Are you still working?</b>

1149
00:59:17,809 --> 00:59:20,509
<b>Yes. I have some work to do.
Go ahead and eat.</b>

1150
00:59:21,180 --> 00:59:22,250
<b>Gyu Jin.</b>

1151
00:59:23,150 --> 00:59:25,995
<b>I went a bit overboard
and made a lot of rice balls.</b>

1152
00:59:26,019 --> 00:59:27,979
<b>If you didn't have dinner,
do you want to join us?</b>

1153
00:59:29,319 --> 00:59:30,460
<b>Really?</b>

1154
00:59:31,019 --> 00:59:33,406
<b>I was just wondering
what to have for dinner.</b>

1155
00:59:33,430 --> 00:59:35,289
<b>Let's eat together. Have a seat.</b>

1156
00:59:35,630 --> 00:59:36,630
<b>Can I join you?</b>

1157
00:59:37,299 --> 00:59:38,799
<b>I want to sit next to you, Si Hoo.</b>

1158
00:59:44,140 --> 00:59:45,140
<b>Here.</b>

1159
00:59:45,539 --> 00:59:50,055
<b>Gosh, this is amazing.
I love fried tofu rice balls.</b>

1160
00:59:50,079 --> 00:59:51,309
<b>Let me try it.</b>

1161
00:59:53,579 --> 00:59:55,180
<b>It's so delicious.</b>

1162
00:59:55,309 --> 00:59:57,755
<b>Did you make this yourself?
Are you sure you didn't buy it?</b>

1163
00:59:57,779 --> 01:00:01,926
<b>No. I make good kimbap
and fried tofu rice balls.</b>

1164
01:00:01,950 --> 01:00:03,390
<b>This is really good.</b>

1165
01:00:04,089 --> 01:00:06,029
<b>- Mom.
- What, Si Hoo?</b>

1166
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:07,436
<b>I need to go to the restroom.</b>

1167
01:00:07,460 --> 01:00:08,666
<b>I'll take you to the restroom.
We'll be back...</b>

1168
01:00:08,690 --> 01:00:10,400
<b>No. I can go by myself.</b>

1169
01:00:15,900 --> 01:00:18,670
<b>I was careless earlier. I'm sorry.</b>

1170
01:00:25,410 --> 01:00:28,549
<b>All right.
I should be cool and go talk to him.</b>

1171
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:37,390
<b>What are you doing here alone?</b>

1172
01:00:38,819 --> 01:00:40,359
<b>Hello.</b>

1173
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:44,176
<b>Are you waiting for your mom?</b>

1174
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:46,599
<b>No. I'm just sitting here.</b>

1175
01:00:46,630 --> 01:00:48,075
<b>Really? Why?</b>

1176
01:00:48,099 --> 01:00:50,640
<b>So Mom can be with the doctor.</b>

1177
01:00:51,140 --> 01:00:53,015
<b>The doctor? Who?</b>

1178
01:00:53,039 --> 01:00:55,170
<b>My mom's friend.</b>

1179
01:00:55,809 --> 01:00:57,079
<b>She likes him.</b>

1180
01:00:57,710 --> 01:00:59,039
<b>She keeps smiling.</b>

1181
01:01:02,849 --> 01:01:07,349
<b>Apparently, your mom
and the doctor used to be close.</b>

1182
01:01:07,720 --> 01:01:09,089
<b>That's what I heard.</b>

1183
01:01:11,259 --> 01:01:14,460
<b>By the way, Si Hoo,
where's your dad?</b>

1184
01:01:14,859 --> 01:01:17,259
<b>I don't think I've met him before.</b>

1185
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:21,630
<b>I don't have a dad.</b>

1186
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:25,700
<b>I don't even know his face.
I haven't met him before.</b>

1187
01:01:26,509 --> 01:01:29,785
<b>Do you remember?
There was a bakery near the church.</b>

1188
01:01:29,809 --> 01:01:32,609
<b>You bought me
a lot of cream buns there.</b>

1189
01:01:32,779 --> 01:01:35,650
<b>I remember that. I did.</b>

1190
01:01:35,910 --> 01:01:40,490
<b>To be honest with you,
I don't like cream buns.</b>

1191
01:01:41,220 --> 01:01:43,690
<b>One day,
I just said that I liked it.</b>

1192
01:01:44,420 --> 01:01:46,366
<b>And I had to eat it
until I got sick and tired of it.</b>

1193
01:01:46,390 --> 01:01:49,735
<b>Really? You should've told me.</b>

1194
01:01:49,759 --> 01:01:51,805
<b>How could I tell you that?</b>

1195
01:01:51,829 --> 01:01:54,599
<b>I mean you bought them for me.</b>

1196
01:01:55,470 --> 01:01:58,069
<b>You're so silly, Gyu Jin.</b>

1197
01:01:58,700 --> 01:02:01,015
<b>Then why are you
telling me all this now?</b>

1198
01:02:01,039 --> 01:02:02,640
<b>You should've taken it
to your grave.</b>

1199
01:02:02,980 --> 01:02:04,210
<b>To embarrass you.</b>

1200
01:02:04,940 --> 01:02:06,880
<b>Gosh, you're so mean.</b>

1201
01:02:09,619 --> 01:02:11,720
<b>That's perfect timing, Gyu Jin.</b>

1202
01:02:26,099 --> 01:02:27,230
<b>Excuse me.</b>

1203
01:02:28,900 --> 01:02:30,500
<b>Hello, sir.</b>

1204
01:02:31,799 --> 01:02:33,240
<b>With Dr. Song?</b>

1205
01:02:34,410 --> 01:02:35,440
<b>Right now?</b>

1206
01:02:37,839 --> 01:02:39,210
<b>That jerk.</b>

1207
01:02:39,650 --> 01:02:42,485
<b>Instead of watching the store,
he sat there...</b>

1208
01:02:42,509 --> 01:02:44,950
<b>laughing with those nasty women.</b>

1209
01:02:46,650 --> 01:02:48,289
<b>The moment I saw that,</b>

1210
01:02:48,690 --> 01:02:51,795
<b>I felt lasers come out of my eyes
like I was an evil dinosaur.</b>

1211
01:02:51,819 --> 01:02:55,136
<b>Wait. Don't evil dinosaurs
spew flames from their mouths?</b>

1212
01:02:55,160 --> 01:02:56,930
<b>They do. From their mouths.</b>

1213
01:02:59,630 --> 01:03:02,745
<b>Whether it's eyes or mouth,
that's not the point!</b>

1214
01:03:02,769 --> 01:03:05,476
<b>Let's all calm down, shall we?</b>

1215
01:03:05,500 --> 01:03:08,210
<b>What are you saying we should do?</b>

1216
01:03:10,579 --> 01:03:12,985
<b>You said we can't let this happen.</b>

1217
01:03:13,009 --> 01:03:14,226
<b>What do you want to do?</b>

1218
01:03:14,250 --> 01:03:18,019
<b>Give them a warning.
Once and for all.</b>

1219
01:03:18,349 --> 01:03:19,990
<b>A warning? What kind of warning?</b>

1220
01:03:21,220 --> 01:03:24,990
<b>It's not like our market
is a huge bar.</b>

1221
01:03:25,259 --> 01:03:27,265
<b>They're stealing our customers...</b>

1222
01:03:27,289 --> 01:03:29,559
<b>and laughing while
they're barely clothed.</b>

1223
01:03:29,730 --> 01:03:34,230
<b>That's a huge minus to
our image as a whole.</b>

1224
01:03:34,630 --> 01:03:36,216
<b>We should act as one...</b>

1225
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:38,946
<b>and tell them
not to do business like that!</b>

1226
01:03:38,970 --> 01:03:41,269
<b>As one? As in, we all go over there?</b>

1227
01:03:41,869 --> 01:03:43,410
<b>If you don't want me to,</b>

1228
01:03:44,410 --> 01:03:47,656
<b>Ok Boon can lead a few of us.</b>

1229
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:48,710
<b>What? Me?</b>

1230
01:03:48,809 --> 01:03:51,095
<b>Why me? I can't do that.</b>

1231
01:03:51,119 --> 01:03:53,420
<b>Those women scare me.</b>

1232
01:03:54,990 --> 01:03:59,490
<b>Still, you're married to
the merchant association president.</b>

1233
01:03:59,930 --> 01:04:03,035
<b>Who can take action
at a time like this if you won't?</b>

1234
01:04:03,059 --> 01:04:05,075
<b>We don't have the authority.</b>

1235
01:04:05,099 --> 01:04:08,075
<b>But I don't think that...</b>

1236
01:04:08,099 --> 01:04:09,799
<b>Yes. Just do it, Ok Boon.</b>

1237
01:04:10,869 --> 01:04:13,970
<b>- What?
- We three will back you up.</b>

1238
01:04:14,170 --> 01:04:15,485
<b>Let's give them a notice...</b>

1239
01:04:15,509 --> 01:04:17,980
<b>and go back to business as usual.</b>

1240
01:04:18,339 --> 01:04:20,579
<b>I need my chemical peels.</b>

1241
01:04:20,750 --> 01:04:22,525
<b>Let's go.
Let's put them in their place.</b>

1242
01:04:22,549 --> 01:04:24,619
<b>- Yes, let's.
- Let's all go.</b>

1243
01:04:27,490 --> 01:04:28,549
<b>My gosh.</b>

1244
01:04:30,220 --> 01:04:31,619
<b>- Appear on TV?
- Appear on TV?</b>

1245
01:04:31,819 --> 01:04:32,819
<b>Yes.</b>

1246
01:04:33,630 --> 01:04:35,150
<b>You know the show "Doctors",
don't you?</b>

1247
01:04:35,460 --> 01:04:37,359
<b>It's the number one hit show
on cable TV.</b>

1248
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:40,670
<b>The producer is
my society president's nephew,</b>

1249
01:04:41,029 --> 01:04:43,616
<b>and the president
had recommended you two...</b>

1250
01:04:43,640 --> 01:04:44,970
<b>join the panel as regulars.</b>

1251
01:04:45,470 --> 01:04:47,710
<b>It's spring and they're planning
to switch things around.</b>

1252
01:04:47,970 --> 01:04:49,170
<b>Isn't that great?</b>

1253
01:04:51,009 --> 01:04:53,710
<b>I don't know. It's a bit...</b>

1254
01:04:54,250 --> 01:04:55,849
<b>I'm not interested.</b>

1255
01:04:56,549 --> 01:04:59,726
<b>TV isn't my thing.
Please refuse for me.</b>

1256
01:04:59,750 --> 01:05:00,750
<b>What?</b>

1257
01:05:01,319 --> 01:05:02,849
<b>I already gave the okay.</b>

1258
01:05:04,059 --> 01:05:07,589
<b>I thought you'd jump at the chance.</b>

1259
01:05:08,390 --> 01:05:10,829
<b>Every doctor wants to
be on that show.</b>

1260
01:05:11,559 --> 01:05:12,829
<b>It's a regular spot.</b>

1261
01:05:13,769 --> 01:05:16,640
<b>Not only can you
promote our hospital,</b>

1262
01:05:17,039 --> 01:05:20,240
<b>but it'll be a huge plus
for your careers.</b>

1263
01:05:20,809 --> 01:05:23,410
<b>Yes, I know that, but still.</b>

1264
01:05:24,309 --> 01:05:27,886
<b>If it has to be from our hospital,
ask Dr. Jo and Dr. Park...</b>

1265
01:05:27,910 --> 01:05:30,396
<b>My society president
recommended you.</b>

1266
01:05:30,420 --> 01:05:33,049
<b>You two, not Dr. Jo and Dr. Park.</b>

1267
01:05:34,490 --> 01:05:37,690
<b>I'm sorry, director.
I have nothing more to say.</b>

1268
01:05:40,630 --> 01:05:41,630
<b>Dr. Song.</b>

1269
01:05:42,190 --> 01:05:44,329
<b>You can't leave
during the conversation!</b>

1270
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:48,799
<b>Do something, will you?</b>

1271
01:05:49,470 --> 01:05:52,339
<b>You should back me up
even if she won't.</b>

1272
01:05:54,109 --> 01:05:56,410
<b>The timing is not that great.</b>

1273
01:05:57,539 --> 01:05:58,579
<b>I apologize.</b>

1274
01:05:58,740 --> 01:06:01,180
<b>Do it instead of apologizing.</b>

1275
01:06:02,710 --> 01:06:04,019
<b>Must you be like this?</b>

1276
01:06:39,579 --> 01:06:42,190
<b>- Put the ingredients in the fridge.
- Okay.</b>

1277
01:06:43,019 --> 01:06:44,990
<b>We're closed for... My goodness.</b>

1278
01:06:47,329 --> 01:06:48,329
<b>My gosh.</b>

1279
01:06:49,029 --> 01:06:51,000
<b>Aren't you the chicken lady?</b>

1280
01:06:51,359 --> 01:06:52,829
<b>What brings you all here?</b>

1281
01:06:55,529 --> 01:06:58,769
<b>Okay, so, the thing is...</b>

1282
01:07:02,369 --> 01:07:04,279
<b>We're here to give you a warning.</b>

1283
01:07:41,980 --> 01:07:44,480
<b>(Once Again)</b>

1284
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:46,156
<b>I was nasty in my time.</b>

1285
01:07:46,180 --> 01:07:48,825
<b>I'll show them what it means
to belittle someone.</b>

1286
01:07:48,849 --> 01:07:51,666
<b>Don't back down. 90 percent
of a fight is your energy.</b>

1287
01:07:51,690 --> 01:07:53,960
<b>It's game over
the moment you feel intimidated.</b>

1288
01:07:54,759 --> 01:07:56,529
<b>I think we're at a dead end.</b>

1289
01:07:56,799 --> 01:07:59,769
<b>We have to go through this one day.</b>

1290
01:08:00,630 --> 01:08:02,845
<b>Mom. How about
you take a day off work...</b>

1291
01:08:02,869 --> 01:08:04,170
<b>and go on a date with me?</b>

1292
01:08:04,339 --> 01:08:06,369
<b>I felt so excited just now.</b>

1293
01:08:06,670 --> 01:08:08,240
<b>Just the thought makes me so happy.</b>

1294
01:08:08,769 --> 01:08:11,386
<b>You must tell her.
You must tell her, Na Hee.</b>

1295
01:08:11,410 --> 01:08:12,440
<b>This is great.</b>

1296
01:08:13,180 --> 01:08:15,710
<b>Mom. The thing is...</b>
