1
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:11,386
<b>Ga Hee, Joon Seon.
It's too late to do this.</b>

2
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:13,240
<b>Last One, you stay here.</b>

3
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,779
<b>Yes. Don't tip off Na Hee
or Mom and Dad.</b>

4
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:19,919
<b>Na Hee got divorced!</b>

5
00:00:26,219 --> 00:00:27,289
<b>What?</b>

6
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:31,059
<b>Na Hee and Gyu Jin got divorced.</b>

7
00:00:31,329 --> 00:00:32,530
<b>Not too long ago.</b>

8
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:44,710
<b>What...</b>

9
00:00:45,409 --> 00:00:47,140
<b>They did what?</b>

10
00:00:48,049 --> 00:00:50,455
<b>Did you just say they got divorced?</b>

11
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:52,326
<b>What nonsense are you spewing?</b>

12
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:53,555
<b>Why would they get divorced?</b>

13
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:55,289
<b>Maybe you got it wrong.</b>

14
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:57,820
<b>Are you sure they got divorced?</b>

15
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,689
<b>Yes, and it's been a while too.</b>

16
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:03,890
<b>I think it was around the time
I got my annulment.</b>

17
00:01:05,329 --> 00:01:06,500
<b>No way.</b>

18
00:01:06,899 --> 00:01:09,076
<b>You've got to be kidding me.</b>

19
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:12,469
<b>Are you saying that those two
have been putting on a show then?</b>

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,969
<b>Unbelievable.</b>

21
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:17,656
<b>Those cheeky rats.</b>

22
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,385
<b>Meanwhile, Mom has been
cooking food for them...</b>

23
00:01:20,409 --> 00:01:21,486
<b>and sending over side dishes.</b>

24
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:24,680
<b>They been accepting her generosity
even though they're divorced?</b>

25
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,525
<b>Those jerks.</b>

26
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:29,795
<b>Joon Seon, please don't.
Calm down for a second.</b>

27
00:01:29,819 --> 00:01:32,066
<b>How can I right now? Move!</b>

28
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:33,959
<b>Joon Seon, don't.</b>

29
00:01:34,019 --> 00:01:36,359
<b>I shouldn't be telling a soul,</b>

30
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:39,476
<b>but I only did
because you two were about to...</b>

31
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,030
<b>make a huge mistake.</b>

32
00:01:41,129 --> 00:01:42,575
<b>So please keep it down.</b>

33
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:44,340
<b>She's right.</b>

34
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:46,376
<b>We shouldn't get
all worked up like this.</b>

35
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,445
<b>Let's calm down.</b>

36
00:01:47,469 --> 00:01:50,445
<b>What am I supposed to do then?</b>

37
00:01:50,469 --> 00:01:52,040
<b>Keep it down!</b>

38
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,609
<b>What were they thinking?</b>

39
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:58,180
<b>How can they keep
their divorce a secret?</b>

40
00:01:59,379 --> 00:02:01,390
<b>Mom had a hard time
processing my annulment.</b>

41
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:04,766
<b>It's probably why they didn't think
it was the right time.</b>

42
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:07,066
<b>Na Hee acts like she cares
about dearly about Mom,</b>

43
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:08,766
<b>but she has a funny way
of showing it.</b>

44
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:10,006
<b>I get why she couldn't tell Mom,</b>

45
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,829
<b>but what about us?</b>

46
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:14,530
<b>She should've at least told us.</b>

47
00:02:14,799 --> 00:02:15,906
<b>I'm her brother, you know.</b>

48
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:18,575
<b>I may have a lame life,
but I'm the oldest in the family!</b>

49
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:21,485
<b>Joon Seon, lower your voice.
Mom will hear you.</b>

50
00:02:21,509 --> 00:02:23,370
<b>Na Hee, that brat.</b>

51
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,639
<b>And why did she agree
to be on a TV show?</b>

52
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,925
<b>She has no idea
how scary this world can be.</b>

53
00:02:27,949 --> 00:02:29,885
<b>I can't take it anymore.
Those jerks...</b>

54
00:02:29,909 --> 00:02:31,620
<b>Joon Seon, please!</b>

55
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,657
<b>Gosh.</b>

56
00:02:32,681 --> 00:02:34,056
<b>Enough with that temper of yours.</b>

57
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,066
<b>You've got to be kidding me.</b>

58
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:40,336
<b>Let's keep it to ourselves
until Na Hee tells us, okay?</b>

59
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,205
<b>I'm sure she won't
drag this out for too long.</b>

60
00:02:42,229 --> 00:02:44,500
<b>Da Hee's right.
I'm sure Na Hee has a plan.</b>

61
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,530
<b>Let's see how things go for now.</b>

62
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:49,246
<b>Fine. No, no can do.</b>

63
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:50,476
<b>Those brats...</b>

64
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,945
<b>- Joon Seon!
- Joon Seon, please.</b>

65
00:02:51,969 --> 00:02:53,716
<b>- Get off me.
- Joon Seon...</b>

66
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,786
<b>- No...
- All right, fine.</b>

67
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:57,855
<b>I won't go, so let go of me.</b>

68
00:02:57,879 --> 00:02:59,439
<b>- Let's head inside then.
- Hands off.</b>

69
00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:02,425
<b>I'll get going, Mom.</b>

70
00:03:02,449 --> 00:03:05,556
<b>They're all packed
in small portions,</b>

71
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:07,126
<b>so freeze them
as soon as you get home.</b>

72
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:08,695
<b>Let them defrost before having it...</b>

73
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:10,626
<b>and serve it boiling.</b>

74
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:12,096
<b>- Got it?
- I got it.</b>

75
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,659
<b>You've already told me that anyway.</b>

76
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:17,430
<b>Are you leaving already?</b>

77
00:03:17,729 --> 00:03:18,960
<b>Are you leaving?</b>

78
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:22,376
<b>I'm exhausted, so I'd like to rest.</b>

79
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,746
<b>If only Gyu Jin was here
to drive you home.</b>

80
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:25,915
<b>Will he get off work late?</b>

81
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:27,569
<b>He's the on-call doctor tonight,</b>

82
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:29,645
<b>so he'll be staying at the hospital.</b>

83
00:03:29,669 --> 00:03:31,439
<b>On-call, my foot.</b>

84
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:35,750
<b>Joon Seon, you seem
to be in a sour mood.</b>

85
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:37,049
<b>Are you upset about something?</b>

86
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:41,189
<b>He's just stressed out from
getting his business off the ground.</b>

87
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:42,395
<b>You should get going.</b>

88
00:03:42,419 --> 00:03:44,325
<b>- Off you go.
- I'll get going then.</b>

89
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:45,936
<b>Let me catch a cab for you.</b>

90
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,590
<b>You'll see her out? Bye, Na Hee!</b>

91
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,966
<b>- That little brat...
- Joon Seon, stop it.</b>

92
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:52,376
<b>- Stop!
- Joon Seon, stop.</b>

93
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,006
<b>We told you to stay put.</b>

94
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,976
<b>You're like a ticking time bomb.</b>

95
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,099
<b>All right, I'll stay calm.</b>

96
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:03,810
<b>Why did she have to pack so much?</b>

97
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:30,670
<b>Mom...</b>

98
00:04:49,449 --> 00:04:50,790
<b>You should eat with me.</b>

99
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:54,120
<b>Mom packed heap portions
of beef bone soup.</b>

100
00:04:58,829 --> 00:05:00,600
<b>I'll heat it up, so have a seat.</b>

101
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:10,110
<b>What's gotten into you?</b>

102
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:12,579
<b>You said I shouldn't eat
anything from your mom.</b>

103
00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:16,649
<b>They go to waste.</b>

104
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:19,579
<b>Besides, she didn't pack them
just for me anyway.</b>

105
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:23,889
<b>The stir-fried chili
and pickled cucumber are for you.</b>

106
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,759
<b>They're your favorite.</b>

107
00:05:35,899 --> 00:05:36,970
<b>It's good.</b>

108
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:39,600
<b>Of course.</b>

109
00:05:39,899 --> 00:05:41,370
<b>My mom made it, didn't she?</b>

110
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:44,139
<b>Clear your soup too.
I want nothing but an empty bowl.</b>

111
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:02,459
<b>Standing all day
while boiling the beef bone soup...</b>

112
00:06:02,589 --> 00:06:03,959
<b>took a toll on my back.</b>

113
00:06:04,389 --> 00:06:06,000
<b>I bet you feel great...</b>

114
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:08,500
<b>that you were able to feed
Na Hee and Gyu Jin though.</b>

115
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:10,569
<b>Of course I'm happy.</b>

116
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:14,540
<b>Just so you know,
I'm done wishing for anything big.</b>

117
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,586
<b>All I want is for Na Hee
to keep living a good life...</b>

118
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:20,555
<b>and have the others
do things that satisfy them.</b>

119
00:06:20,579 --> 00:06:21,910
<b>That's enough, right?</b>

120
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:24,980
<b>That is one big decision.</b>

121
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:27,779
<b>If only you had
thought so in the past.</b>

122
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:35,389
<b>Honey, you know that it's
your birthday in two days, right?</b>

123
00:06:35,459 --> 00:06:36,935
<b>Why's that important?</b>

124
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:38,959
<b>A birthday is what everyone has.</b>

125
00:06:39,329 --> 00:06:41,776
<b>Still, I'm inviting
the merchants from the market...</b>

126
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,639
<b>to celebrate it,
so don't be against the party.</b>

127
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,776
<b>As the president,
you should have these parties,</b>

128
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,516
<b>not only attend those for others.</b>

129
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:51,240
<b>Don't be ridiculous.</b>

130
00:06:51,339 --> 00:06:53,779
<b>All I need to eat
is a bowl of seaweed soup.</b>

131
00:06:54,579 --> 00:06:56,350
<b>I know what you're really after.</b>

132
00:06:56,579 --> 00:06:57,886
<b>You want a reason...</b>

133
00:06:57,910 --> 00:06:59,596
<b>to invite the merchants
from the associations...</b>

134
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:02,165
<b>so that you can boast about
Na Hee and Gyu Jin.</b>

135
00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:05,660
<b>And I know what's exactly
on that mind of yours too.</b>

136
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,336
<b>Every year on your birthday,
you become depressed...</b>

137
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,305
<b>and forbid us from
mentioning parties.</b>

138
00:07:10,329 --> 00:07:12,399
<b>That's all because
of your sister, right?</b>

139
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,069
<b>You've mourned her enough.</b>

140
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:21,716
<b>Enjoy your good days
and let others...</b>

141
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,240
<b>congratulate you now.</b>

142
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:26,009
<b>I'm now going to do
everything I want...</b>

143
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,980
<b>and celebrate your birthday.</b>

144
00:07:50,329 --> 00:07:52,716
<b>Your father's birthday
is tomorrow, right?</b>

145
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,670
<b>What was that, Mom?</b>

146
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:57,485
<b>I'm inviting the merchants
to his birthday dinner,</b>

147
00:07:57,509 --> 00:07:58,740
<b>so be there as well.</b>

148
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:01,216
<b>Really? Did Dad agree to that?</b>

149
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,879
<b>- That's odd.
- Tell me about it.</b>

150
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:04,586
<b>He used to yell at you...</b>

151
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:06,720
<b>for making special dishes
on his birthday.</b>

152
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:09,420
<b>That takes me back
to what happened last year.</b>

153
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:13,295
<b>Dad almost bit my head off
for buying him a strawberry cake.</b>

154
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:16,466
<b>He said that I spend money
on useless things...</b>

155
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:19,500
<b>and only those privileged
should eat 50-dollar cakes.</b>

156
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:23,399
<b>Well, I managed
to persuade him this time.</b>

157
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,276
<b>So help me out in the afternoon.</b>

158
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,899
<b>- Got it.
- Sure.</b>

159
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,170
<b>- I should get there early.
- Hold on.</b>

160
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:31,910
<b>My gosh, Gyu Jin!</b>

161
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:33,439
<b>Mother, it's me.</b>

162
00:08:34,079 --> 00:08:36,850
<b>I enjoyed the beef bone soup
you sent over yesterday.</b>

163
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:39,026
<b>The side dishes
were delicious as well.</b>

164
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:40,679
<b>Did you already have some?</b>

165
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:43,495
<b>The chilies had
a grassy smell to them though.</b>

166
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,519
<b>Really? Well, I enjoyed them a lot.</b>

167
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:49,405
<b>Thank you so much, Mother.</b>

168
00:08:49,429 --> 00:08:50,566
<b>It's fine.</b>

169
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:52,976
<b>Always let me know if you want more.</b>

170
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,436
<b>Of course.</b>

171
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:57,600
<b>You know it's your father-in-law's
birthday tomorrow, right?</b>

172
00:08:57,899 --> 00:09:00,700
<b>We're having a feast at the market,
so swing by.</b>

173
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,210
<b>Right, of course.</b>

174
00:09:05,409 --> 00:09:08,155
<b>You have a show today, right?
Good luck with that.</b>

175
00:09:08,179 --> 00:09:09,755
<b>So much for your weekend.</b>

176
00:09:09,779 --> 00:09:12,720
<b>I'll see you tomorrow then.
Take care.</b>

177
00:09:14,649 --> 00:09:16,649
<b>What did he say?
Will Gyu Jin be there?</b>

178
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,265
<b>Of course he will.</b>

179
00:09:18,289 --> 00:09:20,566
<b>Did he actually say
that he'd be there?</b>

180
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:22,059
<b>Yes, of course.</b>

181
00:09:22,289 --> 00:09:24,166
<b>Why wouldn't he be
at your dad's birthday party?</b>

182
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:25,535
<b>It's his birthday.</b>

183
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:27,529
<b>Those jerks are unbelievable.</b>

184
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:30,970
<b>What's with that response?</b>

185
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,700
<b>It's nothing, Mom.</b>

186
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:35,350
<b>Gyu Jin keeps acting
like he's busy, that's all.</b>

187
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:36,985
<b>I'm glad that he'll be there though.</b>

188
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:38,916
<b>He's not faking his busy hours.</b>

189
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:41,080
<b>He's been working late often
as well.</b>

190
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:43,385
<b>Did you see his gaunt face?</b>

191
00:09:43,409 --> 00:09:45,596
<b>Na Hee must not be
serving him proper food.</b>

192
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:48,090
<b>Why is that Na Hee's job?
Should she be feeding him too?</b>

193
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:50,895
<b>Also, stop being
so sweet on Gyu Jin all the time.</b>

194
00:09:50,919 --> 00:09:52,035
<b>He's not your son, you know.</b>

195
00:09:52,059 --> 00:09:55,159
<b>I, Song Joon Seon, am your son!</b>

196
00:09:56,259 --> 00:09:59,535
<b>Why on earth did these drop?</b>

197
00:09:59,559 --> 00:10:02,100
<b>What's gotten him in
a sour mood this morning?</b>

198
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:05,600
<b>Has his business
not been doing well?</b>

199
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:06,840
<b>Tell me about it.</b>

200
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:17,350
<b>Ga Hee will keep quiet,
but I'm worried about Joon Seon.</b>

201
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,549
<b>Should I come clean
with Gyu Jin's brother?</b>

202
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:24,519
<b>(Mr. Yoon)</b>

203
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:26,720
<b>I can't.</b>

204
00:10:29,659 --> 00:10:32,629
<b>Mr. Yoon, I'm sorry...</b>

205
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,470
<b>I'm too nervous
to sit through class.</b>

206
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:52,750
<b>Ok Ja, are you waiting for someone?</b>

207
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:57,426
<b>What? No, of course not.</b>

208
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:59,495
<b>I was wondering
when Ok Boon would be here.</b>

209
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:02,259
<b>She went to buy groceries,
so she'll be a while.</b>

210
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:06,000
<b>Why do people even
celebrate birthdays?</b>

211
00:11:09,129 --> 00:11:11,870
<b>Ok Ja, cut it out.
She'll get here when she's done.</b>

212
00:11:12,169 --> 00:11:13,669
<b>Is it because you're hungry?</b>

213
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:17,885
<b>Yes, I skipped my breakfast today.</b>

214
00:11:17,909 --> 00:11:20,039
<b>We can't eat until
Ok Boon gets here, right?</b>

215
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:23,655
<b>Honey, can you take this from me?
Gosh, it's heavy.</b>

216
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:26,525
<b>- It's too heavy.
- What on earth did you buy?</b>

217
00:11:26,549 --> 00:11:27,549
<b>Goodness, that's heavy.</b>

218
00:11:27,779 --> 00:11:28,820
<b>What is this?</b>

219
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:31,490
<b>What on earth?</b>

220
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:34,836
<b>Did you seriously buy
a box of these expensive abalones?</b>

221
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,166
<b>Do you have any idea
how much this costs?</b>

222
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:40,700
<b>Don't ask for you might
have a heart attack.</b>

223
00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:43,206
<b>A feast needs
one special dish to be complete.</b>

224
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:45,875
<b>I'm baking them with butter.
The ladies absolutely love those.</b>

225
00:11:45,899 --> 00:11:49,586
<b>Buttered abalones?
The money you must've spent...</b>

226
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:51,956
<b>Can you stop worrying
about the money...</b>

227
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:54,710
<b>for at least once a year?
You're unbelievable.</b>

228
00:11:56,309 --> 00:11:59,155
<b>Ok Ja, what on earth
are you wearing?</b>

229
00:11:59,179 --> 00:12:00,596
<b>Where's your apron?</b>

230
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:02,120
<b>Are you going somewhere nice today?</b>

231
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:06,336
<b>No, I just felt like
wearing this today.</b>

232
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,337
<b>There's only...</b>

233
00:12:07,361 --> 00:12:09,505
<b>a limited amount of time
to wear spring clothes.</b>

234
00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:12,775
<b>It'll be uncomfortable, you know.
At least wear an apron.</b>

235
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:15,029
<b>Let's eat first
and then get everything rolling.</b>

236
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,769
<b>Sure thing.</b>

237
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:19,676
<b>Ok Ja was starving
and she has been waiting for you.</b>

238
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:20,700
<b>Really?</b>

239
00:12:21,909 --> 00:12:24,446
<b>He hasn't been around much
these days.</b>

240
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:26,580
<b>Before, he'd always stop by
when it was time to eat.</b>

241
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,950
<b>Who? You mean Chi Su?</b>

242
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:32,556
<b>I don't know.
He's been awfully busy lately.</b>

243
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:35,466
<b>He hasn't been around because
you keep voicing your hatred.</b>

244
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:37,519
<b>There's only so much
someone can take.</b>

245
00:12:41,889 --> 00:12:44,490
<b>Are you really
giving this to us for free?</b>

246
00:12:44,659 --> 00:12:45,875
<b>Of course.</b>

247
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:49,429
<b>I always hand out leftovers
to my neighbors.</b>

248
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:53,769
<b>I'm not one to make a fuss
over chump change.</b>

249
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:56,846
<b>This doesn't seem
like leftovers to me.</b>

250
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:59,456
<b>It weighs at least a kilogram.</b>

251
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,515
<b>Yes, that's not a small portion.</b>

252
00:13:01,539 --> 00:13:04,309
<b>And it's beef! My gosh.</b>

253
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:07,720
<b>I have an abundance of beef,
you know.</b>

254
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:11,696
<b>Anyway, this is premium sirloin,
so make sure to grill them.</b>

255
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14,166
<b>There's just enough fat in that,</b>

256
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:16,865
<b>so it's perfect for grilling
and it won't make you gain weight.</b>

257
00:13:16,889 --> 00:13:19,836
<b>My gosh. I'm truly grateful.</b>

258
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:23,029
<b>I was wrong to think that
I didn't have any decent neighbors.</b>

259
00:13:23,129 --> 00:13:25,416
<b>This isn't about
just being a giving person.</b>

260
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,440
<b>Only those with good hearts
are this generous.</b>

261
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,710
<b>You're too kind.</b>

262
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,916
<b>While we're on the subject,</b>

263
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:36,309
<b>you should know that
I own more than one store.</b>

264
00:13:36,779 --> 00:13:39,296
<b>I have another one nearby.</b>

265
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,926
<b>Korean barbecue is offered there
and my brother runs it.</b>

266
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:44,166
<b>And the one in Suwon
is run by my sister.</b>

267
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:45,596
<b>However, they're all in my name.</b>

268
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:48,535
<b>My gosh. You're a meat tycoon.</b>

269
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:50,206
<b>You're quite a successful man.</b>

270
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:52,035
<b>Let me know anytime
if you need more meat.</b>

271
00:13:52,059 --> 00:13:53,899
<b>I'll bring it over right away.</b>

272
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,806
<b>I love meat, you know.</b>

273
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:57,976
<b>No way!</b>

274
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,916
<b>Mr. Yang, just a second.</b>

275
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:02,446
<b>I can't receive this
without giving anything in return.</b>

276
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:05,216
<b>Have a seat
and I'll get you a roll of kimbap.</b>

277
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,240
<b>Why not?</b>

278
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:10,350
<b>It's not like I wanted
anything in return...</b>

279
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:12,096
<b>Please have a seat.</b>

280
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,320
<b>Goodness.</b>

281
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,196
<b>- Good job today.
- Thank you.</b>

282
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:21,336
<b>- Good job.
- That was great.</b>

283
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,135
<b>- Good job, everyone.
- Good job.</b>

284
00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:24,405
<b>Good job today.</b>

285
00:14:24,429 --> 00:14:27,460
<b>You both did great too.
I guess I was less nervous today.</b>

286
00:14:27,529 --> 00:14:28,576
<b>Me too.</b>

287
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,830
<b>But that wasn't the case
for a certain someone.</b>

288
00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:31,940
<b>Me?</b>

289
00:14:32,769 --> 00:14:34,500
<b>I was extremely nervous, you know.</b>

290
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:39,039
<b>If I weren't, I would've
ripped you apart on stage.</b>

291
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:43,750
<b>Guys, save the quarrel
for when you get home...</b>

292
00:14:43,879 --> 00:14:45,480
<b>and join me for lunch today.</b>

293
00:14:45,549 --> 00:14:47,229
<b>Don't tell me
you'll decline today as well.</b>

294
00:14:54,019 --> 00:14:55,789
<b>Enjoy. We'll order more
if it's not enough.</b>

295
00:14:57,259 --> 00:14:59,960
<b>It's hard to divide the shrimps
since there are only four.</b>

296
00:15:00,759 --> 00:15:03,500
<b>You're buying today,
so you can take one extra.</b>

297
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:07,399
<b>Sure. Thanks for that.
I won't decline.</b>

298
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,340
<b>All right.</b>

299
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:13,279
<b>So how has life as an outcast
been treating you?</b>

300
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:17,750
<b>Well, it's not the first time
I've been ostracized.</b>

301
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:19,950
<b>Come to think of it,</b>

302
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:22,120
<b>I was like that in middle school
and high school too.</b>

303
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:24,365
<b>I never had many friends.</b>

304
00:15:24,389 --> 00:15:26,919
<b>Judging by your personality,
it's not a surprise.</b>

305
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:36,976
<b>It's all right.</b>

306
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,269
<b>This world needs
people like you anyway.</b>

307
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:41,669
<b>Our show would've been boring
without you.</b>

308
00:15:42,039 --> 00:15:43,970
<b>So keep it up
and don't change anything.</b>

309
00:15:44,809 --> 00:15:47,110
<b>Also, don't mind the hate comments.</b>

310
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:51,820
<b>What? Hate comments?</b>

311
00:15:52,179 --> 00:15:54,320
<b>("Doctors" passes
8 percent in ratings!)</b>

312
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:57,966
<b>That lady is so annoying.</b>

313
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:59,820
<b>You'd get sick
living with a woman like that.</b>

314
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:04,230
<b>The lady doctor is scary.
I feel bad for the husband.</b>

315
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:07,600
<b>Doctor Song Na Hee
thinks this is her own talk show.</b>

316
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:09,799
<b>Are you kidding me?</b>

317
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:12,440
<b>Who are they to say
that I make them sick?</b>

318
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,316
<b>It's not like I'm doing anything
to harm them.</b>

319
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:16,970
<b>Unbelievable.</b>

320
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:21,655
<b>Why would you voluntarily read that?</b>

321
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:23,850
<b>They'll only hurt your mentality.</b>

322
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:27,320
<b>You should've told me
about their harsh reactions though.</b>

323
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,666
<b>Why? Are you going to press charges?</b>

324
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:33,666
<b>I will if there's a need to.
This is a social issue, you know.</b>

325
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:36,105
<b>Anonymity doesn't give you the right
to talk smack about people.</b>

326
00:16:36,129 --> 00:16:38,306
<b>They're killing me with their words.</b>

327
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,176
<b>You're not entirely wrong,</b>

328
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,405
<b>but your words are
just as harsh as theirs...</b>

329
00:16:42,429 --> 00:16:43,976
<b>on and off TV.</b>

330
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,076
<b>It's why you should've
watched your words.</b>

331
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,775
<b>You didn't hold back as always...</b>

332
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:50,940
<b>which resulted in hurtful comments.
Even I would've chimed in.</b>

333
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:54,309
<b>Did you?</b>

334
00:16:55,309 --> 00:16:56,350
<b>No.</b>

335
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:59,019
<b>You did, didn't you?</b>

336
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:02,426
<b>Of course not.
Why would I write hate comments?</b>

337
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:05,596
<b>I'm a civilized person, you know.
This accusation is absurd.</b>

338
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:06,966
<b>- Let me see.
- What are you doing?</b>

339
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:08,566
<b>Don't you look at my phone.</b>

340
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:10,605
<b>I'm going to see
if you wrote any comments.</b>

341
00:17:10,629 --> 00:17:13,775
<b>I didn't! I only pressed
the like button next to a few.</b>

342
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:14,835
<b>Are you satisfied?</b>

343
00:17:14,859 --> 00:17:18,146
<b>What? You pressed the like button?
Are you kidding me?</b>

344
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:19,200
<b>Darn it.</b>

345
00:17:19,299 --> 00:17:20,339
<b>Hey!</b>

346
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:33,680
<b>No. This is wrong.</b>

347
00:17:34,519 --> 00:17:35,650
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

348
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:39,896
<b>- That hurts.
- Why did you suddenly stop?</b>

349
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:42,765
<b>That's because Joon Seon said no.</b>

350
00:17:42,789 --> 00:17:45,329
<b>Were we doing things wrong?</b>

351
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:48,529
<b>Keep training, okay?
I'm heading out.</b>

352
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:51,946
<b>Where are you headed?</b>

353
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:53,339
<b>See you later then.</b>

354
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,186
<b>- Jong Soo.
- Yes?</b>

355
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:59,416
<b>Let's try that again. Take that!</b>

356
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,315
<b>That hurts!
It wasn't on purpose, you know.</b>

357
00:18:01,339 --> 00:18:02,755
<b>It hurts, doesn't it?
You did it on purpose.</b>

358
00:18:02,779 --> 00:18:04,349
<b>- Of course I didn't.
- Get back here.</b>

359
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:09,226
<b>Do you like the pizza I bought?
It's good, isn't it?</b>

360
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:11,495
<b>Yes, it's delicious.</b>

361
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:14,390
<b>Skipping lessons was worth it.
Thanks, Auntie.</b>

362
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:16,805
<b>Did you come into
some money recently?</b>

363
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:18,059
<b>Yes.</b>

364
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:22,230
<b>But this is probably
the last time...</b>

365
00:18:22,269 --> 00:18:23,709
<b>I'll be comfortably
buying you pizza.</b>

366
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:26,900
<b>Call it the calm before the storm
because that's how I feel.</b>

367
00:18:28,869 --> 00:18:29,886
<b>Dad?</b>

368
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:32,039
<b>Hi, girls.</b>

369
00:18:32,309 --> 00:18:36,009
<b>Uncle Joon Seon, have some pizza.
Mom ordered it.</b>

370
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:38,920
<b>I'm good, Ji Hun.
You guys can finish it off.</b>

371
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:40,420
<b>Ga Hee.</b>

372
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:53,829
<b>Why? What's up?</b>

373
00:18:54,059 --> 00:18:56,446
<b>This is just wrong.</b>

374
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:59,815
<b>How can we pretend
to not know anything?</b>

375
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:01,000
<b>Does that make sense to you?</b>

376
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:03,109
<b>I'm upset about it too,</b>

377
00:19:03,869 --> 00:19:04,916
<b>but what can we do?</b>

378
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:06,785
<b>We'll go to Na Hee and...</b>

379
00:19:06,809 --> 00:19:07,856
<b>And do what?</b>

380
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,485
<b>Talk some sense into her.</b>

381
00:19:09,509 --> 00:19:11,656
<b>We'll talk to Gyu Jin too.</b>

382
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:14,079
<b>Don't. Persuading them won't help.</b>

383
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,866
<b>Was that the case
for you and Hyun Gyung?</b>

384
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:18,636
<b>That wasn't the case
for me and Ji Hun's father.</b>

385
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,095
<b>Then we'll tell the truth.</b>

386
00:19:20,119 --> 00:19:22,565
<b>Isn't that what we
should at least do?</b>

387
00:19:22,589 --> 00:19:24,535
<b>How are you going to handle
Mom and Dad later on?</b>

388
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:27,876
<b>I can barely make it through the day
and this anxiety is killing me.</b>

389
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,606
<b>Of course I'm worried
about what's to come.</b>

390
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:32,376
<b>I'm reminded of
what happened three years ago.</b>

391
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,416
<b>I'm most curious
about Na Hee's thoughts.</b>

392
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:38,015
<b>I want to know
why she's putting on a show.</b>

393
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:39,480
<b>I've been wondering about that too.</b>

394
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:42,426
<b>She's not the type
to do anything irrational.</b>

395
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:46,250
<b>Right? So let's meet up
with Na Hee and ask.</b>

396
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,750
<b>Shall we?</b>

397
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:52,289
<b>Okay, let's go to her.</b>

398
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:54,696
<b>We're her older siblings, right?</b>

399
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,059
<b>We can ask that much.</b>

400
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:57,167
<b>Let's go. Move. Okay.</b>

401
00:19:57,191 --> 00:19:58,460
<b>Let's go.</b>

402
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:06,269
<b>- Da Hee.
- Da Hee.</b>

403
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:07,500
<b>Where are you two going?</b>

404
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,985
<b>- What?
- What's the matter?</b>

405
00:20:10,009 --> 00:20:11,109
<b>Where are you going?</b>

406
00:20:11,309 --> 00:20:13,380
<b>What are you doing here
at this time of the day?</b>

407
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,910
<b>- What about training?
- Well... I was just...</b>

408
00:20:16,509 --> 00:20:18,779
<b>We have to go see Na Hee.</b>

409
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,325
<b>We can't just sit on our hands.</b>

410
00:20:21,349 --> 00:20:22,696
<b>We are her sister and brother.</b>

411
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,990
<b>No, you can't.</b>

412
00:20:25,519 --> 00:20:28,359
<b>I promised the person who told me
that I'd keep it to myself.</b>

413
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:31,759
<b>I don't think this is an issue
that we can solve.</b>

414
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:35,235
<b>And you know what Na Hee is like.
If she finds out that you know,</b>

415
00:20:35,259 --> 00:20:38,345
<b>she might just drop a bomb
right away.</b>

416
00:20:38,369 --> 00:20:40,240
<b>Tomorrow is Dad's birthday.</b>

417
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:41,616
<b>Do you really have to do this now?</b>

418
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,369
<b>Oh, right. It's Dad's birthday.</b>

419
00:20:44,609 --> 00:20:45,716
<b>This isn't right.</b>

420
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:47,015
<b>We can't drop a bomb
on Dad's birthday.</b>

421
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:49,450
<b>Hey, you just keep
changing your words.</b>

422
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:52,356
<b>I thought you had a point earlier,</b>

423
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:54,126
<b>but what Da Hee says
sounds about right now.</b>

424
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:56,420
<b>I know. Joon Seon,
we can do this later.</b>

425
00:20:56,519 --> 00:20:59,690
<b>Just wait until
Dad's birthday is over.</b>

426
00:20:59,819 --> 00:21:03,359
<b>Mom is busy ordering rice cake
and preparing food.</b>

427
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:05,406
<b>This isn't the right time.</b>

428
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:08,099
<b>Am I supposed to see them pretending
not to know anything tomorrow?</b>

429
00:21:09,099 --> 00:21:10,369
<b>I can do some acting.</b>

430
00:21:10,599 --> 00:21:11,930
<b>I should tell myself.</b>

431
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:15,446
<b>I don't know anything.
I know nothing.</b>

432
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:16,785
<b>- I don't know.
- Right.</b>

433
00:21:16,809 --> 00:21:19,856
<b>Joon Seon,
you need to relax a little.</b>

434
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:22,650
<b>You don't know anything, okay?
Forget it!</b>

435
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,519
<b>My goodness.</b>

436
00:21:34,019 --> 00:21:36,166
<b>Ms. Choi, I'm back.</b>

437
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:37,529
<b>You're here.</b>

438
00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:39,730
<b>Look. Isn't this beautiful?</b>

439
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:41,476
<b>It's lilac.</b>

440
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,930
<b>Oh, it's lilac.</b>

441
00:21:43,029 --> 00:21:44,900
<b>It is pretty. And it smells good.</b>

442
00:21:45,029 --> 00:21:46,740
<b>Do you know what lilac means?</b>

443
00:21:47,569 --> 00:21:49,940
<b>First love.
Beautiful memories of youth.</b>

444
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:52,809
<b>Isn't it just perfect
for the flower?</b>

445
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:56,410
<b>Youth that's sad but beautiful.</b>

446
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:58,549
<b>And first love.</b>

447
00:22:01,049 --> 00:22:03,025
<b>Come to think of it,</b>

448
00:22:03,049 --> 00:22:05,265
<b>you are just like this lilac.</b>

449
00:22:05,289 --> 00:22:06,960
<b>You're young and beautiful.</b>

450
00:22:07,789 --> 00:22:09,835
<b>You are a lot more
beautiful than I am.</b>

451
00:22:09,859 --> 00:22:12,460
<b>You are dignified and elegant.</b>

452
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:14,759
<b>I can tell that you don't mean it.</b>

453
00:22:15,569 --> 00:22:17,130
<b>That's not true. I really mean it.</b>

454
00:22:17,829 --> 00:22:19,869
<b>Is it because you like flowers?</b>

455
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:21,839
<b>You are just like a flower.</b>

456
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:24,869
<b>I'm just like a withered flower.</b>

457
00:22:26,609 --> 00:22:29,650
<b>Oh, right.
Tomorrow is your father's birthday.</b>

458
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:32,356
<b>I heard there will be a party.
You should take tomorrow off.</b>

459
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:33,495
<b>I will take care of the shop.</b>

460
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:35,926
<b>Are you serious?
Can I really do that?</b>

461
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:37,319
<b>Sure.</b>

462
00:22:38,589 --> 00:22:40,490
<b>And this is your paycheck.</b>

463
00:22:40,619 --> 00:22:42,119
<b>I put in some extra for this month.</b>

464
00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:45,035
<b>Gosh, I thought
I'd get it next week.</b>

465
00:22:45,059 --> 00:22:46,960
<b>Thank you so much.</b>

466
00:22:47,059 --> 00:22:50,700
<b>Actually, I didn't have enough money
to buy my dad a birthday gift.</b>

467
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,240
<b>Now I can buy something expensive.</b>

468
00:22:55,869 --> 00:22:57,245
<b>I'll be upstairs then.</b>

469
00:22:57,269 --> 00:22:58,309
<b>Okay.</b>

470
00:23:07,549 --> 00:23:09,789
<b>Ms. Song, hi.</b>

471
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:12,466
<b>Hello. You're home early.</b>

472
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:14,190
<b>Yes. Mom isn't here.</b>

473
00:23:14,759 --> 00:23:16,166
<b>Ms. Song, when you get off work,</b>

474
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:18,059
<b>how about we grab a beer?
On the steps?</b>

475
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:21,059
<b>No. I have a lot to study today.</b>

476
00:23:21,529 --> 00:23:23,000
<b>That's too bad.</b>

477
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:24,269
<b>All right then.</b>

478
00:23:25,029 --> 00:23:26,069
<b>Study hard!</b>

479
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,349
<b>I'm sorry that I didn't
keep the secret, Mr. Yoon.</b>

480
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:39,720
<b>You can blame me for that later.</b>

481
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,650
<b>I'm so sorry.</b>

482
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:51,130
<b>Other kids are so devoted
to their parents.</b>

483
00:23:51,829 --> 00:23:55,029
<b>She was so happy to buy
her father something expensive.</b>

484
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,900
<b>Is it because she's a daughter?</b>

485
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,569
<b>She's so sweet.</b>

486
00:24:02,609 --> 00:24:04,170
<b>Hello, Mom.</b>

487
00:24:04,839 --> 00:24:06,579
<b>I'm home.</b>

488
00:24:07,009 --> 00:24:08,140
<b>Jae Seok.</b>

489
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,680
<b>Do you know when my birthday is?</b>

490
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:14,980
<b>Mom, are you kidding me?
It's August.</b>

491
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:16,920
<b>Wrong.</b>

492
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:18,549
<b>Is it July?</b>

493
00:24:20,259 --> 00:24:21,319
<b>Wrong again.</b>

494
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,759
<b>It wasn't summer. I know that.</b>

495
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:25,259
<b>October?</b>

496
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:27,000
<b>November?</b>

497
00:24:28,259 --> 00:24:29,529
<b>You punk.</b>

498
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,470
<b>Do you even know my name?</b>

499
00:24:32,269 --> 00:24:33,440
<b>- Go away!
- My gosh.</b>

500
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:34,775
<b>You fool.</b>

501
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:35,785
<b>Why am I a fool?</b>

502
00:24:35,809 --> 00:24:37,410
<b>- I love you.
- Hey!</b>

503
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:40,356
<b>Why don't you come...</b>

504
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:42,015
<b>and have dinner here tomorrow?</b>

505
00:24:42,039 --> 00:24:44,950
<b>It's my husband's birthday,
so I will prepare some food.</b>

506
00:24:45,049 --> 00:24:47,295
<b>You always told me
to throw a birthday party.</b>

507
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:49,819
<b>So is it Mr. Song's BP?</b>

508
00:24:50,019 --> 00:24:51,720
<b>BP? What's that?</b>

509
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,890
<b>A birthday party. It's a BP.</b>

510
00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:59,099
<b>Right. It's a birthday party.
So please come and have dinner.</b>

511
00:24:59,529 --> 00:25:02,430
<b>Are your daughter and son-in-law
from the TV show coming too?</b>

512
00:25:02,529 --> 00:25:04,706
<b>I want to take a picture with them.</b>

513
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:05,946
<b>Of course.</b>

514
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:08,245
<b>It's not like they are celebrities.</b>

515
00:25:08,269 --> 00:25:10,910
<b>Now that they are on TV,
we can call them celebrities.</b>

516
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:13,956
<b>My daughter told me
that they are quite popular.</b>

517
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:17,849
<b>Gosh, she didn't really mean it.</b>

518
00:25:23,819 --> 00:25:26,466
<b>Hello, Ms. Kang.</b>

519
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:29,035
<b>Please come and have dinner
with us tomorrow night.</b>

520
00:25:29,059 --> 00:25:31,136
<b>It's my husband's birthday.</b>

521
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,029
<b>Oh, it's his birthday.</b>

522
00:25:33,829 --> 00:25:36,575
<b>I'll be glad to be here.
I'll bring the girls too.</b>

523
00:25:36,599 --> 00:25:37,670
<b>Okay.</b>

524
00:25:38,099 --> 00:25:41,045
<b>Hello, everyone. You all are early.</b>

525
00:25:41,069 --> 00:25:42,509
<b>- Hello.
- Hi.</b>

526
00:25:42,569 --> 00:25:44,446
<b>Is she here yet?</b>

527
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:45,940
<b>Oh, there she is.</b>

528
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:49,255
<b>Hello, Cho Yeon.</b>

529
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:50,609
<b>Hello. Oh, right.</b>

530
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:53,726
<b>You left this at our store</b>

531
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:56,849
<b>Gosh, I totally forgot.
I looked all over for it.</b>

532
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:58,696
<b>Thank you, Cho Yeon.</b>

533
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,765
<b>No problem.</b>

534
00:25:59,789 --> 00:26:01,636
<b>I really enjoyed the meat
you gave me.</b>

535
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:03,035
<b>It melted in my mouth.</b>

536
00:26:03,059 --> 00:26:04,460
<b>- It was so soft.
- Soft.</b>

537
00:26:08,059 --> 00:26:09,700
<b>- Hey.
- What?</b>

538
00:26:09,799 --> 00:26:12,670
<b>Did you have lunch
at her kimbap restaurant?</b>

539
00:26:13,099 --> 00:26:15,769
<b>Well... I just dropped in on my way.</b>

540
00:26:16,309 --> 00:26:17,745
<b>And what about the meat?</b>

541
00:26:17,769 --> 00:26:20,609
<b>She means she liked the meat
she bought the other day.</b>

542
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:23,210
<b>Go ahead and warm up.</b>

543
00:26:23,849 --> 00:26:26,049
<b>And stop staring at me like that.</b>

544
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:30,295
<b>7 and 8.</b>

545
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:32,995
<b>1, cha-cha. 2, cha-cha.</b>

546
00:26:33,019 --> 00:26:35,595
<b>3, cha-cha. 4, cha-cha.</b>

547
00:26:35,619 --> 00:26:38,065
<b>2, cha-cha. 3, cha-cha.</b>

548
00:26:38,089 --> 00:26:40,059
<b>- 1, cha-cha. 2, cha-cha.
- My goodness.</b>

549
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:45,230
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

550
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:48,869
<b>I got my steps twisted.</b>

551
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,809
<b>My gosh.</b>

552
00:26:51,839 --> 00:26:53,839
<b>It's okay.</b>

553
00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:56,349
<b>You didn't do it on purpose.</b>

554
00:27:10,029 --> 00:27:11,966
<b>(Birthday, Grandpa)</b>

555
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:13,735
<b>(Hello, Grandpa. This is Seo Young.)</b>

556
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:14,805
<b>(Happy birthday to you.)</b>

557
00:27:14,829 --> 00:27:17,829
<b>(Hello, Grandpa. This is Ji Hun.)</b>

558
00:27:19,299 --> 00:27:21,200
<b>You've got a lot of nerve,
Joon Seon.</b>

559
00:27:21,299 --> 00:27:24,210
<b>What if Mom and Dad come home early?</b>

560
00:27:24,569 --> 00:27:26,085
<b>We have to eat dinner anyway.</b>

561
00:27:26,109 --> 00:27:27,539
<b>We will go upstairs soon.</b>

562
00:27:28,509 --> 00:27:31,650
<b>If you haven't had dinner,
you are welcome to join us.</b>

563
00:27:32,279 --> 00:27:33,849
<b>We had pizza earlier.</b>

564
00:27:34,279 --> 00:27:38,750
<b>And I don't want to eat
from the same pot with you.</b>

565
00:27:39,589 --> 00:27:40,936
<b>- Darn it.
- My goodness.</b>

566
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,289
<b>You startled me.</b>

567
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:43,829
<b>You nearly gave me a heart attack!</b>

568
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:44,990
<b>What?</b>

569
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,130
<b>It's just a joke.</b>

570
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,500
<b>I'm fine.</b>

571
00:27:53,539 --> 00:27:55,446
<b>Why are you being like this?</b>

572
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:57,470
<b>We should pretend
not to know anything.</b>

573
00:27:57,910 --> 00:28:00,156
<b>How are we supposed to see Na Hee
and Gyu Jin's faces tomorrow?</b>

574
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:01,839
<b>I don't think
I can keep it a secret.</b>

575
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:03,549
<b>It's hard for me too.</b>

576
00:28:03,609 --> 00:28:05,509
<b>I'm not good at hiding things.</b>

577
00:28:06,049 --> 00:28:07,356
<b>But we have no choice.</b>

578
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:09,650
<b>We should do some acting
and play innocent.</b>

579
00:28:09,849 --> 00:28:11,549
<b>What about Na Hee? Why?</b>

580
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:15,289
<b>It's nothing. It's grown-up stuff.</b>

581
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:17,366
<b>Just finish your letters.</b>

582
00:28:17,390 --> 00:28:18,829
<b>I'm so curious.</b>

583
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:21,230
<b>Can I just hear what it is
and pretend I didn't?</b>

584
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:23,869
<b>Just finish your letter.</b>

585
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:30,509
<b>Anyway, we have to try our best.</b>

586
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:32,069
<b>Whatever.</b>

587
00:28:34,009 --> 00:28:36,250
<b>Hey, did you eat it all already?</b>

588
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,750
<b>Gosh, you jerks.</b>

589
00:28:39,319 --> 00:28:40,380
<b>Stop.</b>

590
00:28:40,579 --> 00:28:41,680
<b>Give me that.</b>

591
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:46,289
<b>Jeong Bong, bring some rice.
I'll eat it with rice.</b>

592
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:53,160
<b>Gosh, you're humming.
Are you that excited?</b>

593
00:28:53,299 --> 00:28:55,029
<b>Yes, I am.</b>

594
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,075
<b>You are the president
of the merchant association.</b>

595
00:28:57,099 --> 00:28:59,916
<b>We should've done this sooner.
It's your birthday party.</b>

596
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:01,839
<b>It's not about my birthday.</b>

597
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:04,886
<b>You are just excited
to brag about Na Hee and Gyu Jin.</b>

598
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:06,485
<b>That's why you can't stop smiling.</b>

599
00:29:06,509 --> 00:29:10,255
<b>I've lived with you
for over 30 years.</b>

600
00:29:10,279 --> 00:29:12,485
<b>Gosh, it's not like that.</b>

601
00:29:12,509 --> 00:29:14,019
<b>I don't care.</b>

602
00:29:14,079 --> 00:29:16,166
<b>Don't brag.
People might get jealous.</b>

603
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:19,250
<b>I don't brag.
I'm just proud of my children.</b>

604
00:29:19,589 --> 00:29:23,259
<b>See? You just told the truth.
My goodness.</b>

605
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:26,505
<b>Gosh, wait. Oh, no.</b>

606
00:29:26,529 --> 00:29:28,230
<b>What's wrong?
Did you forget something?</b>

607
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:32,005
<b>I was charging my phone
and left it in the store.</b>

608
00:29:32,029 --> 00:29:33,176
<b>What was I thinking?</b>

609
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,345
<b>I'll be right back.</b>

610
00:29:34,369 --> 00:29:35,346
<b>Okay.</b>

611
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:37,015
<b>It's dark in the alley.
Watch your step.</b>

612
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:38,140
<b>Okay.</b>

613
00:29:55,089 --> 00:29:57,029
<b>Who's there? Who are you?</b>

614
00:29:58,460 --> 00:29:59,529
<b>Mr. Song.</b>

615
00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:02,130
<b>What...</b>

616
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,470
<b>Why...</b>

617
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:15,710
<b>You've been sleeping here
since you started working here?</b>

618
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,950
<b>Yes. I apologize, sir.</b>

619
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:21,619
<b>Forget about that.</b>

620
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:24,220
<b>How can you
not have a place to stay?</b>

621
00:30:24,589 --> 00:30:27,289
<b>There are studio apartments
and saunas everywhere.</b>

622
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,630
<b>It looks you've been
doing this for a while.</b>

623
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:33,700
<b>Where's your home?</b>

624
00:30:34,299 --> 00:30:35,400
<b>Don't you have a family?</b>

625
00:30:38,599 --> 00:30:39,740
<b>Oh, dear.</b>

626
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,769
<b>I know you're displeased.</b>

627
00:30:42,539 --> 00:30:44,616
<b>If you want me gone, I'll leave.</b>

628
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,740
<b>You must leave.
You can't stay here forever.</b>

629
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:51,710
<b>Clean up and pack your things.</b>

630
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:55,319
<b>Come in.</b>

631
00:30:56,049 --> 00:30:58,966
<b>The building is old,
so it'll be cold and drafty.</b>

632
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:03,230
<b>But wouldn't it be much better than
sleeping on stools in a cold store?</b>

633
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:05,765
<b>Yes. Thank you, sir.</b>

634
00:31:05,789 --> 00:31:07,000
<b>Watch the steps.</b>

635
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,670
<b>There's already a tenant,</b>

636
00:31:10,069 --> 00:31:12,839
<b>but the room is big enough
for two grown men.</b>

637
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:16,940
<b>He's a fool, but he's not evil,
so don't worry.</b>

638
00:31:17,569 --> 00:31:18,609
<b>Mr. Song.</b>

639
00:31:19,369 --> 00:31:22,809
<b>I can't stay for free.
You can deduct my pay...</b>

640
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:26,696
<b>Be quiet. If you disrupt my business
because you lack sleep,</b>

641
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,650
<b>that's my loss.
That's why I'm doing this.</b>

642
00:31:29,549 --> 00:31:31,519
<b>Don't say a word and work hard.</b>

643
00:31:32,049 --> 00:31:33,059
<b>Now follow me.</b>

644
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:41,075
<b>- We haven't started yet.
- We have started.</b>

645
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:42,130
<b>Come in.</b>

646
00:31:43,829 --> 00:31:44,900
<b>My goodness.</b>

647
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,500
<b>Who are you?</b>

648
00:31:51,869 --> 00:31:52,916
<b>We're...</b>

649
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:55,509
<b>Guys, I stole some mandarins.</b>

650
00:31:59,619 --> 00:32:02,019
<b>Are you in your right mind or not?</b>

651
00:32:03,589 --> 00:32:06,859
<b>How can you let them stay
when you barely support yourself?</b>

652
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:08,690
<b>Is this your house?</b>

653
00:32:09,289 --> 00:32:11,930
<b>It's not. I know very well it's not.</b>

654
00:32:12,589 --> 00:32:13,730
<b>Dad.</b>

655
00:32:14,099 --> 00:32:17,099
<b>They quit with me
when I left the stunt team.</b>

656
00:32:17,869 --> 00:32:21,146
<b>They had nowhere to stay
and I couldn't ignore their plight.</b>

657
00:32:21,170 --> 00:32:22,569
<b>Don't you start!</b>

658
00:32:24,339 --> 00:32:25,440
<b>This is insane.</b>

659
00:32:25,869 --> 00:32:30,509
<b>I told you to stop saying,
"I couldn't ignore their plight."</b>

660
00:32:30,579 --> 00:32:32,686
<b>Because you can't ignore anything,</b>

661
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:35,119
<b>you lost your home and got divorced!</b>

662
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:36,990
<b>Does loyalty feed you?</b>

663
00:32:37,019 --> 00:32:38,849
<b>Does it pay
for your kids' education?</b>

664
00:32:39,019 --> 00:32:43,130
<b>Didn't I tell you to
fend for yourself?</b>

665
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:44,890
<b>You idiot.</b>

666
00:32:47,059 --> 00:32:48,130
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

667
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:51,799
<b>Thank you for everything, Joon Seon.</b>

668
00:32:52,599 --> 00:32:54,876
<b>I won't forget what you did for us.</b>

669
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:57,509
<b>I didn't do anything,
so forget about it.</b>

670
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:01,640
<b>Call when you find
a sauna or inn to stay at.</b>

671
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:02,950
<b>Yes, Joon Seon.</b>

672
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:06,049
<b>We were a nuisance to the end.</b>

673
00:33:06,849 --> 00:33:07,920
<b>I apologize.</b>

674
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:09,319
<b>You weren't a nuisance.</b>

675
00:33:10,049 --> 00:33:11,890
<b>I should apologize to you.</b>

676
00:33:12,319 --> 00:33:15,490
<b>I brought you into this place
where you could barely breathe.</b>

677
00:33:15,619 --> 00:33:17,730
<b>You couldn't even
go to the toilet at night.</b>

678
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:21,799
<b>You should train to do stunts
and I only fed you vegetables.</b>

679
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:25,230
<b>I wanted to feed you meat
on my father's birthday,</b>

680
00:33:25,369 --> 00:33:27,369
<b>and you couldn't even eat that.</b>

681
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:29,240
<b>It's okay, Joon Seon.</b>

682
00:33:31,069 --> 00:33:32,785
<b>You thought of us
and that's good enough.</b>

683
00:33:32,809 --> 00:33:36,380
<b>What a joke.
Are you three shooting a movie?</b>

684
00:33:37,549 --> 00:33:40,380
<b>Ga Hee.
Thank you for everything you did.</b>

685
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:43,490
<b>Ma'am. Your side dishes.</b>

686
00:33:44,349 --> 00:33:45,990
<b>They were delicious.</b>

687
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:49,319
<b>I had no idea that you ate any.</b>

688
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:52,430
<b>Yes, but thank you anyway.</b>

689
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:56,406
<b>Before we leave,
we'd like to bow to you.</b>

690
00:33:56,430 --> 00:33:57,407
<b>Take our bow.</b>

691
00:33:57,431 --> 00:34:01,369
<b>You don't need to bow.
It's fine. Just go on your ways.</b>

692
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:04,009
<b>Mom, just accept their bow.</b>

693
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,045
<b>Accept our bow, ma'am.</b>

694
00:34:06,069 --> 00:34:07,779
<b>We want to thank you.</b>

695
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:09,686
<b>I'll bow with them.</b>

696
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:11,980
<b>What on earth is this bow...</b>

697
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,590
<b>Go back up and unpack.</b>

698
00:34:22,019 --> 00:34:24,059
<b>- Pardon?
- It's just for a while.</b>

699
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:27,199
<b>Once you save up by doing stunts,
you move out!</b>

700
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:30,046
<b>- Dad.
- Thank you, sir!</b>

701
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:31,706
<b>Thank you so much, sir!</b>

702
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:34,215
<b>We did it! We found a way out!</b>

703
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:35,400
<b>Song Joon Seon!</b>

704
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:39,780
<b>Starting this month,
you pay 1.5 times in expenses, okay?</b>

705
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:44,510
<b>Dad, that's not right.
1.5 times is too much.</b>

706
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:47,655
<b>Dad, forget that hike
and I'll be good to you.</b>

707
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:48,956
<b>Gosh, no!</b>

708
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:51,190
<b>Dad, I'll pay the 0.5 extra.</b>

709
00:34:52,019 --> 00:34:53,889
<b>- Let's work hard, okay?
- Yes.</b>

710
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:56,059
<b>- Work hard.
- My gosh.</b>

711
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:09,940
<b>Do you have something to say?</b>

712
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:13,340
<b>Yes. How old are you?</b>

713
00:35:13,539 --> 00:35:14,655
<b>Why do you ask?</b>

714
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:16,550
<b>Just to get our age difference.</b>

715
00:35:17,409 --> 00:35:18,409
<b>How about a girlfriend?</b>

716
00:35:19,409 --> 00:35:22,019
<b>Do you have one? You must.</b>

717
00:35:22,179 --> 00:35:23,750
<b>Yes. I do.</b>

718
00:35:23,889 --> 00:35:26,396
<b>How old is she? Is she a student?</b>

719
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:28,219
<b>Is she okay with you
delivering food?</b>

720
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:30,360
<b>I don't mind.</b>

721
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:36,606
<b>No wonder
I couldn't find you anywhere.</b>

722
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:38,345
<b>What are you doing up here?</b>

723
00:35:38,369 --> 00:35:41,099
<b>Don't mind me, Auntie.
I'm hitting on a guy.</b>

724
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:44,146
<b>My goodness.
You're hitting on someone?</b>

725
00:35:44,170 --> 00:35:45,969
<b>You know what I'm talking about.</b>

726
00:35:46,639 --> 00:35:49,679
<b>I like this guy.</b>

727
00:35:52,610 --> 00:35:53,849
<b>We met, haven't we?</b>

728
00:35:54,179 --> 00:35:57,150
<b>I'm sorry. She's brazen for her age.</b>

729
00:35:57,289 --> 00:36:00,320
<b>She loses her mind
when she sees handsome guys.</b>

730
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:04,035
<b>That's you, Auntie.
I value style over looks.</b>

731
00:36:04,059 --> 00:36:05,690
<b>They're the same thing.</b>

732
00:36:06,599 --> 00:36:09,945
<b>Shouldn't you go home?
A teenager must sleep to grow.</b>

733
00:36:09,969 --> 00:36:13,500
<b>And you must sleep early
to prevent wrinkles from forming.</b>

734
00:36:15,139 --> 00:36:17,785
<b>Shall I tell your mom
you skipped class to come here?</b>

735
00:36:17,809 --> 00:36:18,909
<b>That's not fair!</b>

736
00:36:20,909 --> 00:36:22,686
<b>Don't be silly, Auntie.</b>

737
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:26,325
<b>Threaten me and I'll tell Grandpa
that you have your shopping...</b>

738
00:36:26,349 --> 00:36:27,956
<b>delivered to my place.</b>

739
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:31,495
<b>How dare you talk back to your aunt?</b>

740
00:36:31,519 --> 00:36:34,019
<b>I'm sorry,
but could you please leave?</b>

741
00:36:34,519 --> 00:36:35,960
<b>I'd like to change.</b>

742
00:36:38,789 --> 00:36:42,559
<b>We should get out
if you're to change. Right.</b>

743
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:43,730
<b>Let's go.</b>

744
00:36:44,969 --> 00:36:47,539
<b>See you again.
I'll come by the store tomorrow.</b>

745
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:49,369
<b>Goodbye.</b>

746
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,570
<b>You can change now.</b>

747
00:36:54,110 --> 00:36:56,010
<b>Come in and unpack.</b>

748
00:37:05,289 --> 00:37:07,719
<b>What should I do about that fool?</b>

749
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:11,630
<b>How can he run a business
when he's so soft?</b>

750
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,530
<b>Why are you smiling?</b>

751
00:37:17,369 --> 00:37:20,369
<b>He takes after you. Don't blame him.</b>

752
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:23,539
<b>Who? How does he take after me?</b>

753
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:26,139
<b>Being soft.
Not being able to say no.</b>

754
00:37:26,170 --> 00:37:27,785
<b>That's all you.</b>

755
00:37:27,809 --> 00:37:29,480
<b>Who brought Hyo Sin here?</b>

756
00:37:32,309 --> 00:37:36,420
<b>You're the only one who doesn't see
Joon Seon is like you.</b>

<b>Will we have to gather around

763

<b>Of course.
It's your duty as our children.</b>

<b>What time are we expected

<b>Sometime around dinner, I guess.</b>

828

<b>We'll take my car.
Call me when your shift ends.</b>

<b>I was too flustered yesterday

<b>Fate brought us together, right?
Anyway, I'm Oh Jeong Bong.</b>

<b>but we've been learning

<b>Bruce Lee was the one

<b>I wonder why I got that mixed up.</b>

908
00:46:15,689 --> 00:46:17,589
<b>Just so you know,
it's my birthday today,</b>

909
00:46:18,230 --> 00:46:20,129
<b>but I haven't been able
to celebrate it.</b>

910
00:46:21,230 --> 00:46:25,800
<b>I felt terrible for only being
the one that keeps on aging.</b>

911
00:46:26,930 --> 00:46:30,040
<b>Still, my family has been upset
because of it though.</b>

912
00:46:31,069 --> 00:46:34,480
<b>Please go ahead.
The tea has been brewed perfectly.</b>

913
00:46:45,620 --> 00:46:47,820
<b>Everyone we encounter
in this world...</b>

914
00:46:49,019 --> 00:46:50,960
<b>is like the tea leaf in your teacup.</b>

915
00:46:52,029 --> 00:46:53,929
<b>It always drifts back toward you.</b>

916
00:46:54,730 --> 00:46:58,600
<b>Those who you're bound to meet
will show up in your life somehow.</b>

917
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:01,480
<b>I sometimes just swallow
the tea leaf, you know.</b>

918
00:47:01,870 --> 00:47:03,769
<b>I let it be if it gets caught...</b>

919
00:47:04,669 --> 00:47:06,070
<b>in my throat.</b>

920
00:47:11,179 --> 00:47:14,210
<b>I'm finding it hard
to remember her face now.</b>

921
00:47:15,279 --> 00:47:16,750
<b>If she had been alive,</b>

922
00:47:17,419 --> 00:47:19,690
<b>she would've become
a beautiful lady.</b>

923
00:47:24,690 --> 00:47:26,666
<b>Two rolls of beef kimbap, right?</b>

924
00:47:26,690 --> 00:47:28,330
<b>- Please enjoy.
- Thank you.</b>

925
00:47:28,399 --> 00:47:30,000
<b>We'll order another
roll of tuna kimbap.</b>

926
00:47:30,059 --> 00:47:31,946
<b>Cho Yeon, one roll of tuna kimbap.</b>

927
00:47:31,970 --> 00:47:34,440
<b>Okay, one extra roll of tuna kimbap!</b>

928
00:47:36,470 --> 00:47:39,446
<b>Gosh, you guys are on a roll today.</b>

929
00:47:39,470 --> 00:47:41,409
<b>Mr. Yang, you're here again.</b>

930
00:47:42,379 --> 00:47:45,480
<b>A few chunks of meat
didn't sell today.</b>

931
00:47:45,879 --> 00:47:48,456
<b>It's a rump steak.
Instead of grilling it,</b>

932
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:50,826
<b>make a dish of raw beef.
You'll love it.</b>

933
00:47:50,850 --> 00:47:53,166
<b>I love raw beef, you know.</b>

934
00:47:53,190 --> 00:47:55,789
<b>I'm not sure if I should
be taking this though.</b>

935
00:47:55,990 --> 00:47:59,005
<b>By the way, will you be at
President Song's birthday party?</b>

936
00:47:59,029 --> 00:48:01,005
<b>I thought I'd swing by for a meal.</b>

937
00:48:01,029 --> 00:48:04,336
<b>His wife is an exceptional cook,
so don't miss it.</b>

938
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:06,299
<b>I'll see you two there as well.</b>

939
00:48:06,929 --> 00:48:07,916
<b>See you later.</b>

940
00:48:07,940 --> 00:48:09,899
<b>- Bye.
- See you later.</b>

941
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:12,240
<b>Girls, look at what he brought us.</b>

942
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:13,870
<b>How much do you think this is worth?</b>

943
00:48:14,409 --> 00:48:16,379
<b>Isn't it odd though?</b>

944
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:18,610
<b>Why does he keep
bringing us free meat?</b>

945
00:48:18,710 --> 00:48:20,125
<b>Why else?</b>

946
00:48:20,149 --> 00:48:22,320
<b>He's fallen for one of us.</b>

947
00:48:22,679 --> 00:48:24,495
<b>I thought you knew men better.</b>

948
00:48:24,519 --> 00:48:25,696
<b>I wonder which one of us though.</b>

949
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:27,326
<b>You? Me?</b>

950
00:48:27,350 --> 00:48:28,895
<b>Why are you leaving me out?</b>

951
00:48:28,919 --> 00:48:32,759
<b>I melted the hearts
of a number of men back in the day.</b>

952
00:48:33,759 --> 00:48:35,529
<b>That's a lie, right?</b>

953
00:48:36,159 --> 00:48:37,235
<b>It can't be you.</b>

954
00:48:37,259 --> 00:48:39,100
<b>Mr. Yang has standards, right?</b>

955
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:41,240
<b>It hurts my pride to say this,</b>

956
00:48:41,370 --> 00:48:43,799
<b>but I guess I'm not a match
to you when it comes to age.</b>

957
00:48:43,899 --> 00:48:46,985
<b>You must be happy
to have him bring you...</b>

958
00:48:47,009 --> 00:48:48,686
<b>free meat like this.</b>

959
00:48:48,710 --> 00:48:49,779
<b>So who could it be?</b>

960
00:48:53,450 --> 00:48:55,995
<b>Did Joon Seon go
to catch the fish himself?</b>

961
00:48:56,019 --> 00:48:58,365
<b>He should be back
from the fish market by now.</b>

962
00:48:58,389 --> 00:49:01,259
<b>Why not help us with the food?
I'm exhausted, you know.</b>

963
00:49:01,389 --> 00:49:02,666
<b>He'll be back when he's done,</b>

964
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:04,535
<b>so stop complaining
and taste this for me.</b>

965
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:06,666
<b>Should I add more soy sauce?</b>

966
00:49:06,690 --> 00:49:08,000
<b>That's a job I'm the best at.</b>

967
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:09,960
<b>Here you go.</b>

968
00:49:13,299 --> 00:49:14,370
<b>What do you think?</b>

969
00:49:16,139 --> 00:49:17,446
<b>- It's amazing.
- Really?</b>

970
00:49:17,470 --> 00:49:18,916
<b>It's perfect.</b>

971
00:49:18,940 --> 00:49:20,145
<b>Me too, Mom.</b>

972
00:49:20,169 --> 00:49:21,255
<b>You too?</b>

973
00:49:21,279 --> 00:49:22,580
<b>Here you go.</b>

974
00:49:25,610 --> 00:49:26,710
<b>My gosh!</b>

975
00:49:27,009 --> 00:49:29,820
<b>Can I take some of this to Ms. Choi?</b>

976
00:49:29,919 --> 00:49:31,490
<b>She let me have the day off.</b>

977
00:49:31,690 --> 00:49:32,889
<b>Why not?</b>

978
00:49:33,649 --> 00:49:36,296
<b>Ok Ja, can you pack
some of the japchae and jeon...</b>

979
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:37,635
<b>for Yun Jeong?</b>

980
00:49:37,659 --> 00:49:40,429
<b>What? What did you ask me to do?</b>

981
00:49:41,230 --> 00:49:42,259
<b>Unbelievable.</b>

982
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:44,299
<b>The japchae and jeon!</b>

983
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:46,105
<b>Get a grip on yourself.</b>

984
00:49:46,129 --> 00:49:47,916
<b>You've been spacing out
a lot these days.</b>

985
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:51,240
<b>When did I space out?
You're making that up.</b>

986
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:55,909
<b>Auntie, your makeup
seems darker these days.</b>

987
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:59,649
<b>Is it perhaps
because you're seeing someone?</b>

988
00:50:00,149 --> 00:50:02,350
<b>Dating?</b>

989
00:50:02,379 --> 00:50:06,149
<b>At least accuse me of that
after setting me up with someone.</b>

990
00:50:06,350 --> 00:50:09,360
<b>I'm too busy finding someone
for myself, you know.</b>

991
00:50:09,590 --> 00:50:11,730
<b>Isn't there anyone decent
who works at the market?</b>

992
00:50:12,990 --> 00:50:15,535
<b>Auntie, what about Mr. Yang?</b>

993
00:50:15,559 --> 00:50:17,000
<b>Isn't he sexy in a way?</b>

994
00:50:17,029 --> 00:50:19,605
<b>Tell me about it.
So you realized it too.</b>

995
00:50:19,629 --> 00:50:21,676
<b>Are you insane?</b>

996
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:26,145
<b>Don't dare link me with that man.
It's upsetting, you know.</b>

997
00:50:26,169 --> 00:50:29,485
<b>She and Mr. Yang won't work.</b>

998
00:50:29,509 --> 00:50:30,655
<b>They're polar opposites.</b>

999
00:50:30,679 --> 00:50:31,679
<b>Really?</b>

1000
00:50:31,879 --> 00:50:34,720
<b>I think he's a decent guy though.</b>

1001
00:50:34,919 --> 00:50:36,879
<b>- He's manly.
- Yes.</b>

1002
00:50:37,820 --> 00:50:39,620
<b>- Funny.
- Of course.</b>

1003
00:50:39,950 --> 00:50:42,659
<b>And sexy for a man his age.</b>

1004
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:45,035
<b>He sees the world in a simple way
which makes him cute.</b>

1005
00:50:45,059 --> 00:50:46,105
<b>Exactly.</b>

1006
00:50:46,129 --> 00:50:48,659
<b>That's why he's been
driving me insane.</b>

1007
00:50:49,299 --> 00:50:51,275
<b>If you're that interested in him,</b>

1008
00:50:51,299 --> 00:50:53,169
<b>maybe you should date him.</b>

1009
00:50:54,070 --> 00:50:55,100
<b>Should I?</b>

1010
00:50:55,970 --> 00:50:58,370
<b>I would've jumped at the chance
had he not been Dad's friend.</b>

1011
00:50:59,470 --> 00:51:00,610
<b>Unbelievable.</b>

1012
00:51:00,769 --> 00:51:03,285
<b>Are you insane?</b>

1013
00:51:03,309 --> 00:51:05,309
<b>You just don't know
what's appropriate.</b>

1014
00:51:05,409 --> 00:51:07,186
<b>I was only joking. Gosh, that hurts.</b>

1015
00:51:07,210 --> 00:51:08,480
<b>Unbelievable.</b>

1016
00:51:09,580 --> 00:51:10,926
<b>Auntie, Mom doesn't approve.</b>

1017
00:51:10,950 --> 00:51:12,149
<b>I guess he's all yours.</b>

1018
00:51:13,419 --> 00:51:14,889
<b>I'd love to call him mine.</b>

1019
00:51:17,389 --> 00:51:19,159
<b>Here you go.
It's raw halibut and rockfish.</b>

1020
00:51:19,289 --> 00:51:21,929
<b>You love raw fish.
Enjoy it with the kids.</b>

1021
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:24,306
<b>I even got some freebies
on the side.</b>

1022
00:51:24,330 --> 00:51:25,600
<b>Take them with you.</b>

1023
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,076
<b>How could you hand us these
when it's for your dad's birthday?</b>

1024
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:30,799
<b>I bought extra for you guys.</b>

1025
00:51:31,139 --> 00:51:33,186
<b>Just take it, will you?</b>

1026
00:51:33,210 --> 00:51:35,985
<b>You had to cancel your class
since I couldn't take Seo Jin today.</b>

1027
00:51:36,009 --> 00:51:37,379
<b>A day won't hurt me.</b>

1028
00:51:39,110 --> 00:51:41,655
<b>Besides, I'm grateful
for your parents...</b>

1029
00:51:41,679 --> 00:51:43,049
<b>babysitting her every other day.</b>

1030
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:46,049
<b>Anyway, just take this.</b>

1031
00:51:46,149 --> 00:51:47,690
<b>Please.</b>

1032
00:51:48,190 --> 00:51:49,190
<b>Come on.</b>

1033
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:53,230
<b>Anyway, enjoy,
and leave some for Seo Young.</b>

1034
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:55,629
<b>She loves raw fish,
so she'll smell it in the air.</b>

1035
00:51:55,860 --> 00:51:58,200
<b>All right. Thanks for this.</b>

1036
00:51:59,669 --> 00:52:03,370
<b>At the market,
I was reminded of the time we dated.</b>

1037
00:52:03,970 --> 00:52:05,916
<b>We bought a plate of raw halibut...</b>

1038
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:08,240
<b>and enjoyed it by the Han River.</b>

1039
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:14,649
<b>Our hearts were full
of all kinds of emotions...</b>

1040
00:52:14,919 --> 00:52:17,279
<b>even though we barely had
anything going for us.</b>

1041
00:52:19,519 --> 00:52:21,250
<b>Get going now.
You don't want to be late.</b>

1042
00:52:21,389 --> 00:52:22,889
<b>I hope your dad's party goes well.</b>

1043
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:24,159
<b>Right.</b>

1044
00:52:30,799 --> 00:52:33,230
<b>You were brave back then...</b>

1045
00:52:33,899 --> 00:52:35,659
<b>to fall for someone
who had nothing to offer.</b>

1046
00:52:40,710 --> 00:52:42,385
<b>Look, it's my daughter!</b>

1047
00:52:42,409 --> 00:52:43,885
<b>Dad, you're an idiot.</b>

1048
00:52:43,909 --> 00:52:45,649
<b>You should've pushed it more.</b>

1049
00:52:52,750 --> 00:52:54,470
<b>You should eat the raw fish
instead of this.</b>

1050
00:52:54,889 --> 00:52:56,389
<b>I'll have that too.</b>

1051
00:52:57,360 --> 00:52:58,529
<b>I can eat a lot, you know.</b>

1052
00:53:01,059 --> 00:53:02,375
<b>- Dad.
- Yes?</b>

1053
00:53:02,399 --> 00:53:04,299
<b>How did you and Mom meet?</b>

1054
00:53:04,399 --> 00:53:05,429
<b>Your mom?</b>

1055
00:53:06,299 --> 00:53:08,139
<b>On the job.</b>

1056
00:53:08,570 --> 00:53:09,775
<b>Did she do stunts too?</b>

1057
00:53:09,799 --> 00:53:11,139
<b>As if.</b>

1058
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:13,210
<b>You know how she's awful
at physical activities.</b>

1059
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:14,610
<b>It was something else.</b>

1060
00:53:14,710 --> 00:53:17,940
<b>Mom loved you back then, right?</b>

1061
00:53:19,179 --> 00:53:20,809
<b>Why else would she have married you?</b>

1062
00:53:22,179 --> 00:53:23,179
<b>Did she?</b>

1063
00:53:24,649 --> 00:53:25,789
<b>I guess she did.</b>

1064
00:53:27,919 --> 00:53:29,990
<b>Then Mom is the traitor.</b>

1065
00:53:30,259 --> 00:53:31,860
<b>How can one's love change?</b>

1066
00:53:34,190 --> 00:53:36,799
<b>I'm grateful for you
being on my side,</b>

1067
00:53:37,759 --> 00:53:39,200
<b>but your mom did change...</b>

1068
00:53:39,669 --> 00:53:41,100
<b>and I caused it.</b>

1069
00:53:42,169 --> 00:53:44,440
<b>That makes me the bad guy.</b>

1070
00:53:46,110 --> 00:53:48,139
<b>As if you know anything
about love anyway.</b>

1071
00:53:48,580 --> 00:53:50,279
<b>You little pinhead.</b>

1072
00:53:54,350 --> 00:53:57,850
<b>My goodness.
You didn't have to bring me this.</b>

1073
00:53:58,690 --> 00:54:01,265
<b>I could've easily bought some
at the department store.</b>

1074
00:54:01,289 --> 00:54:05,230
<b>Store-bought food
is nothing like homemade meals.</b>

1075
00:54:05,330 --> 00:54:06,436
<b>Please have some
while they're still warm.</b>

1076
00:54:06,460 --> 00:54:08,476
<b>All right. Then I'll enjoy this.</b>

1077
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:09,875
<b>Tell your mother that I'm grateful.</b>

1078
00:54:09,899 --> 00:54:10,960
<b>Sure thing.</b>

1079
00:54:11,529 --> 00:54:13,169
<b>I'm home, Mom.</b>

1080
00:54:13,299 --> 00:54:14,330
<b>Hey.</b>

1081
00:54:14,669 --> 00:54:16,115
<b>Hi, Ms. Song.</b>

1082
00:54:16,139 --> 00:54:18,686
<b>I'll get going then.
My mom needs my help.</b>

1083
00:54:18,710 --> 00:54:19,687
<b>Sure thing.</b>

1084
00:54:19,711 --> 00:54:23,316
<b>I had flowers delivered to wish
your father a happy birthday.</b>

1085
00:54:23,340 --> 00:54:24,885
<b>Gosh, thank you.</b>

1086
00:54:24,909 --> 00:54:26,779
<b>- I'll get going then.
- Sure.</b>

1087
00:54:26,879 --> 00:54:27,909
<b>Ms. Song...</b>

1088
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:32,096
<b>Look at all this food.</b>

1089
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:34,289
<b>Ok Boon has always been generous.</b>

1090
00:54:35,460 --> 00:54:37,895
<b>Maybe I should've given her a cake.</b>

1091
00:54:37,919 --> 00:54:39,265
<b>I have a whole cake in the fridge.</b>

1092
00:54:39,289 --> 00:54:41,289
<b>Let me run along and give it to her.</b>

1093
00:54:42,730 --> 00:54:43,730
<b>Ms. Song.</b>

1094
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:45,230
<b>Ms. Song!</b>

1095
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:47,169
<b>Here you go.</b>

1096
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:49,320
<b>Mom said you should have it.</b>

1097
00:54:49,639 --> 00:54:51,169
<b>It's for the birthday party.</b>

1098
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:52,615
<b>She shouldn't have.</b>

1099
00:54:52,639 --> 00:54:54,316
<b>Tell her I'm grateful then. Bye.</b>

1100
00:54:54,340 --> 00:54:55,409
<b>Ms. Song.</b>

1101
00:54:57,639 --> 00:55:00,480
<b>Why does it feel
like you're avoiding me?</b>

1102
00:55:01,279 --> 00:55:02,625
<b>Did I do something wrong?</b>

1103
00:55:02,649 --> 00:55:04,320
<b>No, of course not.</b>

1104
00:55:04,450 --> 00:55:07,690
<b>Then was it you
who did something wrong?</b>

1105
00:55:09,919 --> 00:55:11,759
<b>I'm only joking, you know.</b>

1106
00:55:11,990 --> 00:55:13,905
<b>I really need to get going,</b>

1107
00:55:13,929 --> 00:55:15,829
<b>so I'll see you some other time.
Bye, then.</b>

1108
00:55:15,930 --> 00:55:16,930
<b>But...</b>

1109
00:55:19,470 --> 00:55:21,830
<b>Something is definitely up.
Why else could she be like that?</b>

1110
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:23,670
<b>And here I thought we were friends,</b>

1111
00:55:24,339 --> 00:55:25,339
<b>but maybe not.</b>

1112
00:55:35,250 --> 00:55:38,319
<b>Say that this is from you.
It's a dress shirt.</b>

1113
00:55:38,890 --> 00:55:41,190
<b>I'll give him some money
in an envelope.</b>

1114
00:55:41,289 --> 00:55:42,359
<b>Sure.</b>

1115
00:55:44,619 --> 00:55:47,130
<b>The ladies at the market
can be a bit too much,</b>

1116
00:55:47,529 --> 00:55:49,460
<b>but please try and get along.</b>

1117
00:55:49,799 --> 00:55:50,799
<b>Got it.</b>

1118
00:55:53,269 --> 00:55:55,539
<b>Why are you so pliant today?
This isn't like you.</b>

1119
00:55:57,970 --> 00:55:59,570
<b>Let's say that
your mom's chilies worked.</b>

1120
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:03,656
<b>Besides, it's your expression
that needs to soften up.</b>

1121
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:06,680
<b>Anyone could tell that
we're a divorced couple.</b>

1122
00:56:13,750 --> 00:56:15,089
<b>Guys, get over here.</b>

1123
00:56:15,220 --> 00:56:16,835
<b>You recognize them, right?</b>

1124
00:56:16,859 --> 00:56:19,565
<b>Here's my daughter

1125
00:56:19,589 --> 00:56:21,606
<b>- Hello.
- He looks familiar.</b>

1126
00:56:21,630 --> 00:56:22,636
<b>Right.</b>

1127
00:56:22,660 --> 00:56:24,505
<b>- He's on TV.
- That's right.</b>

1128
00:56:24,529 --> 00:56:26,869
<b>Anyway, guys, get over here.</b>

1129
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,206
<b>You recognize them, right?</b>

1130
00:56:28,230 --> 00:56:30,970
<b>My daughter and son-in-law

00:56:31,140 --> 00:56:32,216
<b>Hello.</b>

1132
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:34,039
<b>This is my first time seeing them.</b>

1133
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:36,716
<b>The celebrities
look even better in person.</b>

1134
00:56:36,740 --> 00:56:38,079
<b>Celebrities?</b>

1135
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:40,485
<b>- Gosh, thank you.
- You're both so pretty.</b>

1136
00:56:40,509 --> 00:56:41,525
<b>Thank you, ma'am.</b>

1137
00:56:41,549 --> 00:56:43,126
<b>Let's head over there next.</b>

1138
00:56:43,150 --> 00:56:44,295
<b>Where?</b>

1139
00:56:44,319 --> 00:56:45,519
<b>Over here.</b>

1140
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:46,866

<b>This is my daughter

<b>I've been enjoying the show,
you know.</b>

1144
00:56:53,630 --> 00:56:56,735
<b>Can I get a photo later on
so that I can brag about it?</b>

1145
00:56:56,759 --> 00:56:58,305
<b>Me too. I want one too.</b>

1146
00:56:58,329 --> 00:56:59,829
<b>Yes, of course.</b>

1147
00:57:00,029 --> 00:57:02,039
<b>Look at those pretentious jerks.</b>

1148
00:57:02,539 --> 00:57:04,500
<b>See the show they're putting on?</b>

1149
00:57:04,569 --> 00:57:06,186
<b>They're following Mom around
and saying hi.</b>

1150

<b>Gyu Jin is the worst.</b>

1151

<b>Tell me about it.</b>

1152
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:11,849
<b>I'm disgusted

1153
00:57:12,049 --> 00:57:14,186
<b>Joon Seon,
please look the other way.</b>

1154
00:57:14,210 --> 00:57:16,356
<b>You're only making it obvious
by glaring at him.</b>

1155
00:57:16,380 --> 00:57:18,466
<b>I just can't help it.</b>

1156
00:57:18,490 --> 00:57:20,226
<b>Look how excited Mom is now.</b>

1157
00:57:20,250 --> 00:57:21,619
<b>How can I not lose my temper?</b>
