<b>That night,</b>

7

<b>I had something to talk about with your mom.</b>

8

10

<b>Do you think I don't know anything?</b>

11

<b>How long do you think you can fool me?</b>

12

<b>Can you guys stop using me as an excuse?</b>

13

<b>So just stop it already!</b>

15
00:01:42,067 --> 00:01:43,336
<b>What should we do?</b>

16
00:01:48,507 --> 00:01:50,677
<b>Just find Joon Young and take him home.</b>

<b>Do what you can to console him.</b>

<b>Make sure this doesn't end up hurting him even more.</b>

20

<b>That's all I want.</b>

21

<b>What's the problem?</b>

22
00:02:22,537 --> 00:02:23,837
<b>I fixed the situation.</b>

23
00:02:23,837 --> 00:02:27,007
<b>I don't want to discuss it. Send him to Sun Woo.</b>

24

<b>Send him to his mom.</b>

25
00:02:29,576 --> 00:02:31,347
<b>You can't handle him!</b>

26
00:02:31,646 --> 00:02:32,916
<b>He's Tae Oh's son.</b>

27
00:02:33,317 --> 00:02:34,687
<b>I won't send him to that woman.</b>

28
00:02:34,817 --> 00:02:36,717
<b>I brought him here, so he's my responsibility.</b>

30

<b>That's more than enough!</b>

31
00:02:40,757 --> 00:02:42,726
<b>I heard he's violent.</b>

32
00:02:42,796 --> 00:02:44,456
<b>What if he hurts Jenny?</b>

33
00:02:44,696 --> 00:02:46,926
<b>He got angry and made a mistake.</b>

34
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:49,236
<b>He'll be fine if we're thoughtful of him.</b>

35
00:02:49,537 --> 00:02:51,437
<b>I can take care of him.</b>

36

<b>What's wrong with her?</b>

37
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:01,507
<b>What about Da Kyung? Is something wrong?</b>

38
00:03:01,507 --> 00:03:04,777
<b>I didn't raise her to raise someone else's son!</b>

39

<b>Mom's leaving.</b>

45

<b>Did you go somewhere?</b>

46
00:04:58,797 --> 00:05:00,927
<b>Honey, I'm going to talk to Joon Young for a few minutes.</b>

47
00:05:09,477 --> 00:05:12,446
<b>Do you remember what I said when you first moved in?</b>

48
00:05:13,906 --> 00:05:16,146
<b>That I hoped you'll be comfortable here.</b>

49

<b>That you need to be happy for your dad to be happy.</b>

50

<b>You were hurt because of what the adults did,</b>

51
00:05:26,127 --> 00:05:28,456
<b>and I'm responsible for half of it.</b>

52
00:05:29,956 --> 00:05:31,757
<b>So I fixed it this time,</b>

53
00:05:32,497 --> 00:05:34,596
<b>but if something like this happens again,</b>

54
00:05:35,196 --> 00:05:36,937
<b>I can't just protect you unconditionally.</b>

55
00:05:38,196 --> 00:05:39,406
<b>Don't do it again.</b>

56
00:05:41,766 --> 00:05:43,377
<b>It'll make it hard for all of us.</b>

57
00:05:45,076 --> 00:05:47,007
<b>Do it for yourself.</b>

58

<b>Can you promise me?</b>

59
00:06:00,886 --> 00:06:01,956
<b>Okay.</b>

60
00:06:04,557 --> 00:06:05,696
<b>Thanks.</b>

61
00:06:09,196 --> 00:06:11,797
<b>From now on, get my permission before you go anywhere.</b>

62

<b>Aren't you going to answer me?</b>

63
00:06:21,747 --> 00:06:22,817
<b>Okay.</b>

64
00:06:38,096 --> 00:06:39,266
<b>What did you talk about?</b>

65
00:06:39,497 --> 00:06:42,997
<b>I told him to get permission before going out.</b>

66
00:06:47,036 --> 00:06:49,906
<b>Honey. Do you know Joon Young's friends?</b>

67
00:06:51,136 --> 00:06:52,276
<b>Not really.</b>

68
00:06:52,276 --> 00:06:55,516
<b>I think we should keep tabs on what he does and with whom...</b>

69
00:06:56,677 --> 00:06:58,747
<b>and control whom he hangs out with.</b>

70
00:07:00,117 --> 00:07:03,086
<b>Okay. I'll talk to him.</b>

<b>(Recent calls)</b>

74
00:08:00,946 --> 00:08:02,846
<b>He wouldn't leave me alone.</b>

75
00:08:05,076 --> 00:08:07,586
<b>But he doesn't even call today of all days.</b>

76
00:08:08,487 --> 00:08:09,987
<b>He was useless,</b>

77
00:08:12,727 --> 00:08:14,286
<b>but I wish he were here.</b>

78

<b>Are you very sick? Have you eaten?</b>

80
00:08:35,046 --> 00:08:37,977
<b>What... You sound like you came because you knew.</b>

81
00:08:37,977 --> 00:08:40,516
<b>Myung Sook told me you went to the hospital,</b>

82
00:08:41,617 --> 00:08:43,457
<b>and that you got a bunch of painkillers.</b>

83
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:46,127
<b>She's such a big mouth.</b>

84
00:08:46,127 --> 00:08:47,587
<b>You should've told me.</b>

85
00:08:48,827 --> 00:08:51,056
<b>Must I have someone else tell me that you're sick?</b>

86
00:08:51,056 --> 00:08:53,827
<b>I'll be sick and grow old alone for the rest of my life.</b>

87
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:56,367
<b>I should get used to it.</b>

88
00:09:03,477 --> 00:09:04,536
<b>What is this?</b>

89
00:09:05,337 --> 00:09:06,447
<b>This?</b>

90
00:09:15,247 --> 00:09:16,816
<b>It's tiramisu.</b>

91

<b>I remembered you used to eat this whenever you were sick.</b>

92
00:09:19,727 --> 00:09:20,987
<b>To be honest,</b>

93
00:09:21,827 --> 00:09:23,357
<b>it didn't come to me right away.</b>

94
00:09:23,627 --> 00:09:25,967
<b>I got confused whether it was chocolate...</b>

95
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:29,036
<b>or tiramisu.</b>

96
00:09:32,266 --> 00:09:33,406
<b>Have some.</b>

97
00:09:34,636 --> 00:09:35,936
<b>Aren't you tired of this?</b>

98
00:09:36,536 --> 00:09:39,176
<b>No. I'm happy.</b>

99
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:44,046
<b>From the moment I started to wonder how I can help since you're sick...</b>

100
00:09:44,577 --> 00:09:46,717
<b>and the entire time while I was coming here with this,</b>

<b>I was happy.</b>

102

<b>I was glad that there was something I could do for you.</b>

<b>She has appointments this morning.</b>

<b>She'll have to wait a little.</b>

115
00:11:23,347 --> 00:11:26,617
<b>She got sick after taking the drugs she prescribed.</b>

116

<b>Can't she see her first?</b>

117

<b>It's still before office hours...</b>

118

<b>Hold on.</b>

119
00:11:35,587 --> 00:11:36,656
<b>What about Dr. Kim from Internal Medicine?</b>

<b>- You two, take her in. - Okay.</b>

<b>Please excuse me, sir.</b>

140
00:12:54,367 --> 00:12:56,676
<b>This is a pain reliever. Please relax.</b>

141
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:03,877
<b>Since when did you feel this pain?</b>

142
00:13:04,046 --> 00:13:08,416
<b>Around dawn. My stomach started to hurt around dawn.</b>

143

<b>There seems to be bleeding according to the ultrasound.</b>

144

<b>Let's have you take a CT scan.</b>

<b>Is it serious?</b>

152

<b>Just stay quiet and don't get involved.</b>

<b>I'll try to resolve it.</b>

154

<b>Hey, you said she had irritable bowel syndrome!</b>

<b>Your misdiagnosis put her in danger!</b>

<b>What will you do?</b>

161
00:14:11,816 --> 00:14:13,347
<b>How will you take responsibility?</b>

162
00:14:15,016 --> 00:14:16,316
<b>- Close the door. - Yes, ma'am.</b>

163
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:21,487
<b>The pain worsened because a cyst flared.</b>

164
00:14:21,587 --> 00:14:22,997
<b>We should keep a watch on her,</b>

165
00:14:22,997 --> 00:14:25,656
<b>but at this moment, there are no problems with her ovaries.</b>

166
00:14:25,896 --> 00:14:27,166
<b>One can't get infertile from this.</b>

167
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:31,396
<b>Anyway, it's true she gave us a misdiagnosis.</b>

168
00:14:33,207 --> 00:14:34,306
<b>Am I wrong?</b>

169
00:14:35,837 --> 00:14:36,906
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

170
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:40,676
<b>It's irrational to say it's a misdiagnosis!</b>

171
00:14:40,676 --> 00:14:42,477
<b>If this isn't a misdiagnosis, what is it?</b>

172
00:14:43,117 --> 00:14:45,416
<b>You said a cyst popped and now she's bleeding.</b>

173
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:47,587
<b>It says on the chart that she was recommended to see...</b>

174
00:14:47,587 --> 00:14:48,886
<b>an OBGYN.</b>

175
00:14:49,217 --> 00:14:50,886
<b>Didn't your daughter say that?</b>

176
00:14:52,087 --> 00:14:53,156
<b>No.</b>

177
00:14:54,656 --> 00:14:56,097
<b>I haven't heard.</b>

178
00:14:56,097 --> 00:14:57,857
<b>Go and check with her.</b>

179
00:14:59,796 --> 00:15:01,497
<b>Gosh.</b>

180
00:15:01,926 --> 00:15:03,936
<b>I was so startled in the middle of the night.</b>

181
00:15:04,566 --> 00:15:08,207
<b>If she needs surgery, I won't let you get away with this.</b>

182
00:15:08,536 --> 00:15:11,906
<b>I prescribed her some painkillers and antibiotics,</b>

183
00:15:11,906 --> 00:15:13,377
<b>so she can go home once you've calmed down.</b>

184
00:15:13,847 --> 00:15:15,707
<b>I'll book her in for an appointment three days from now.</b>

185
00:15:15,707 --> 00:15:18,377
<b>If she feels any pain or gets dizzy before then,</b>

186
00:15:18,377 --> 00:15:20,347
<b>come to the hospital right away.</b>

187
00:15:20,747 --> 00:15:23,087
<b>My daughter better be fine.</b>

188
00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:27,156
<b>I'll sue that doctor and the hospital.</b>

189
00:15:27,386 --> 00:15:28,526
<b>Understand?</b>

190
00:15:33,197 --> 00:15:35,227
<b>Don't apologize so hastily.</b>

191
00:15:35,227 --> 00:15:37,837
<b>The moment you say that, it proves you did wrong.</b>

192
00:15:40,566 --> 00:15:43,377
<b>Anyway, it was my mistake for not checking her ultrasound.</b>

193
00:15:43,536 --> 00:15:45,977
<b>They won't care if you missed doing an ultrasound...</b>

194
00:15:45,977 --> 00:15:47,546
<b>or made a misdiagnosis.</b>

195
00:15:47,676 --> 00:15:49,516
<b>Don't take all the blame after apologizing,</b>

196
00:15:49,516 --> 00:15:50,776
<b>and just sit still.</b>

197
00:15:51,077 --> 00:15:52,646
<b>I'll take care of everything else.</b>

198
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:03,526
<b>Dr. Ji, what's with you these days?</b>

199
00:16:04,357 --> 00:16:06,997
<b>I understand you had to take some time off for your son.</b>

200
00:16:07,367 --> 00:16:09,737
<b>But you can't miss something so basic on her first checkup.</b>

201
00:16:09,737 --> 00:16:10,936
<b>How is this possible?</b>

202

<b>You were never late before, but now you're leaving early...</b>

205
00:16:18,136 --> 00:16:19,747

206
00:16:19,747 --> 00:16:20,947
<b>What's going on with you?</b>

207
00:16:21,447 --> 00:16:23,847
<b>Don't you think you have a problem?</b>

208
00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:28,516
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

209

<b>Sit here.</b>

273

<b>Shall we go eat?</b>

274
00:22:01,647 --> 00:22:03,286
<b>I heard something huge on my way over.</b>

<b>Dr. Ji handed in her resignation.</b>

<b>Da Kyung, isn't this good news for you?</b>

<b>It's also good news for both you and your husband.</b>

<b>It's not exactly something we've been hoping for.</b>

<b>But I guess it's not bad news.</b>

281
00:22:59,306 --> 00:23:01,677
<b>What did you do today?</b>

282
00:23:02,376 --> 00:23:03,717
<b>I stayed home all day.</b>

283
00:23:05,346 --> 00:23:07,546
<b>- What about your academy? - She told me to get a tutor...</b>

284
00:23:08,286 --> 00:23:09,447
<b>instead of going outside.</b>

285
00:23:14,387 --> 00:23:16,227
<b>I'm pretty much confined, aren't I?</b>

286
00:23:18,026 --> 00:23:19,157
<b>Okay.</b>

287
00:23:20,096 --> 00:23:21,326
<b>I'll talk to her.</b>

288
00:23:48,626 --> 00:23:49,796
<b>Hey, you're home.</b>

289
00:23:49,897 --> 00:23:52,056
<b>We talked for longer than expected. Where is Joon Young?</b>

290
00:23:53,197 --> 00:23:55,296
<b>- He went upstairs after he ate. - I see.</b>

291
00:23:57,036 --> 00:23:59,697
<b>It's school break right now, so why don't we go on a family trip?</b>

292
00:24:00,137 --> 00:24:02,507
<b>The four of us can go somewhere nearby.</b>

293
00:24:03,576 --> 00:24:04,737
<b>That sounds great.</b>

294
00:24:06,977 --> 00:24:08,046
<b>By the way,</b>

295
00:24:09,177 --> 00:24:11,346
<b>- about Joon Young going outside... - Oh, right.</b>

296
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:15,447
<b>I found a counselor for Joon Young and made a reservation.</b>

297
00:24:16,586 --> 00:24:18,016
<b>- "A counselor"? - Yes.</b>

298
00:24:18,586 --> 00:24:20,887
<b>She's an expert in counseling teenage kids.</b>

299
00:24:21,227 --> 00:24:23,457
<b>She's famous for fixing problematic behaviors.</b>

300
00:24:23,657 --> 00:24:25,096
<b>It wasn't easy to make a reservation.</b>

301
00:24:27,197 --> 00:24:28,667
<b>Does he really need to get counseling?</b>

302
00:24:28,897 --> 00:24:30,967
<b>He needs to get treated for kleptomania.</b>

303
00:24:31,497 --> 00:24:34,066
<b>- We can't just leave it... - Are you calling him a thief?</b>

304
00:24:38,177 --> 00:24:41,306
<b>I'm saying we need to be very careful about it.</b>

305
00:24:41,376 --> 00:24:42,447
<b>Can't you...</b>

306
00:24:43,677 --> 00:24:45,247
<b>just give him some time?</b>

307
00:24:45,677 --> 00:24:47,887
<b>Let him breathe a little.</b>

308
00:24:49,717 --> 00:24:51,157
<b>Why can't you just trust him and wait?</b>

309
00:24:51,157 --> 00:24:53,356
<b>What's so wrong about getting professional help?</b>

310
00:24:55,626 --> 00:24:58,796
<b>I tried my best to find a way so I could help Joon Young.</b>

311
00:24:58,796 --> 00:25:01,626
<b>- Yes, I know. But... - If you know, then cooperate.</b>

312
00:25:03,026 --> 00:25:06,167
<b>Don't tell me what you want or what you think.</b>

313
00:25:06,467 --> 00:25:08,137
<b>Right now, we should do what's best for Joon Young.</b>

314
00:25:11,776 --> 00:25:12,907
<b>Okay?</b>

315
00:25:41,106 --> 00:25:42,167
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

316
00:25:45,407 --> 00:25:46,507
<b>And thank you.</b>

317
00:25:49,507 --> 00:25:52,876
<b>Do you want me to take Joon Young to his counseling sessions?</b>

318

<b>If Jenny grows up and causes trouble as well,</b>

319
00:26:06,257 --> 00:26:07,826
<b>I'd do the same thing.</b>

320
00:26:14,836 --> 00:26:18,507
<b>Things are slowly going back to where they belong.</b>

321
00:26:19,876 --> 00:26:21,546
<b>From now on, we'll be perfect.</b>

322

<b>(A World of Married Couple)</b>

323
00:26:31,856 --> 00:26:33,257
<b>I think this one will do.</b>

324
00:26:39,826 --> 00:26:42,096
<b>- How was the meeting? - Well...</b>

325
00:26:47,637 --> 00:26:48,707
<b>Can I trust you?</b>

326
00:26:51,207 --> 00:26:53,346
<b>- Remember what we discussed? - Yes.</b>

327
00:27:07,757 --> 00:27:08,856
<b>Your brother's leaving.</b>

328
00:27:09,687 --> 00:27:10,897
<b>Say "Bye".</b>

329
00:27:11,556 --> 00:27:13,866
<b>Gosh, you say goodbye so well.</b>

330
00:27:39,556 --> 00:27:42,126
<b>Joon Young, how was your week?</b>

331
00:27:48,126 --> 00:27:51,167
<b>Did you ever feel angry or sad?</b>

332
00:27:55,237 --> 00:27:56,366
<b>Yes.</b>

333
00:27:57,276 --> 00:28:01,276
<b>Can you tell me what made you felt that way?</b>

334
00:28:07,016 --> 00:28:08,187
<b>Come in.</b>

335
00:28:10,356 --> 00:28:11,457
<b>Hey, you're here.</b>

336
00:29:01,306 --> 00:29:03,606
<b>- Myung Sook. - Hey.</b>

337

<b>(Ji Sun Woo)</b>

338
00:29:07,606 --> 00:29:10,217
<b>- You're here. - What's this on your coat?</b>

339
00:29:11,647 --> 00:29:12,816
<b>- Shall we go? - Yes, let's go.</b>

340
00:30:00,897 --> 00:30:01,997
<b>Thank you.</b>

341
00:30:27,427 --> 00:30:30,197
<b>I'm starting to feel better now that I'm eating something spicy.</b>

342
00:30:33,157 --> 00:30:35,727
<b>Where do you think she went? She won't even answer my calls.</b>

343
00:30:37,397 --> 00:30:38,866
<b>Maybe she went to get some fresh air.</b>

344
00:30:40,407 --> 00:30:43,237
<b>Do you think she feels uneasy about having quit her job?</b>

345
00:30:43,237 --> 00:30:44,437
<b>Why would she feel uneasy?</b>

346
00:30:44,876 --> 00:30:46,376
<b>You told me she was already planning to leave.</b>

347
00:30:49,947 --> 00:30:51,346
<b>But I bet he feels uneasy about it.</b>

348
00:30:52,447 --> 00:30:53,516
<b>Who?</b>

349
00:30:54,987 --> 00:30:56,957
<b>- Tae Oh? - Yes.</b>

350
00:30:57,957 --> 00:30:59,157
<b>At least, that's how he looks.</b>

351
00:31:00,927 --> 00:31:02,957
<b>Why would he feel uneasy? They're over now.</b>

352
00:31:03,056 --> 00:31:05,257
<b>You only say that because you don't know men.</b>

353
00:31:06,056 --> 00:31:09,026
<b>Even when a guy is with someone, he has eyes for other women.</b>

354
00:31:09,526 --> 00:31:12,266
<b>And guys think about their exes quite often as well.</b>

355
00:31:13,036 --> 00:31:14,137
<b>That's how guys are.</b>

356
00:31:24,477 --> 00:31:25,576
<b>But not me.</b>

357
00:31:26,546 --> 00:31:30,086
<b>I'm not like that at all. I was talking about Tae Oh.</b>

358
00:31:31,786 --> 00:31:33,457
<b>Gosh, that jerk.</b>

359
00:31:44,637 --> 00:31:46,296
<b>Did you ever get a call from your mom?</b>

360
00:31:47,766 --> 00:31:48,866
<b>No.</b>

361
00:31:49,137 --> 00:31:50,576
<b>Are you sure you didn't just ignore her calls?</b>

362
00:31:52,606 --> 00:31:53,747
<b>No.</b>

363
00:32:15,897 --> 00:32:16,967
<b>Hello.</b>

364
00:33:12,016 --> 00:33:14,887
<b>You wouldn't call even after I told you there were openings,</b>

365
00:33:15,387 --> 00:33:16,626
<b>then you show up out of the blue.</b>

366
00:33:19,296 --> 00:33:20,596
<b>I wanted some fresh air.</b>

367
00:33:22,227 --> 00:33:23,766
<b>I left the hospital.</b>

368
00:33:26,197 --> 00:33:27,467
<b>Are you going to Busan?</b>

369
00:33:28,467 --> 00:33:30,066
<b>Was it finalized?</b>

370
00:33:32,007 --> 00:33:33,007
<b>No.</b>

371
00:33:35,407 --> 00:33:38,016
<b>I want to take a break.</b>

372
00:33:38,977 --> 00:33:41,316
<b>Why did you come all the way here to see me?</b>

373
00:33:41,786 --> 00:33:44,316
<b>You have a good psychiatrist close by.</b>

374
00:33:47,887 --> 00:33:50,626
<b>It's time for my rounds. What do you want to do?</b>

375
00:33:51,257 --> 00:33:53,596
<b>Go ahead. I'm not leaving anytime soon.</b>

376
00:33:53,596 --> 00:33:56,197
<b>Okay. Let's finish talking later.</b>

377
00:33:57,467 --> 00:34:00,237
<b>But don't say let's go for a drink.</b>

378
00:34:01,907 --> 00:34:04,606
<b>- Did you really quit? - Of course.</b>

379
00:34:10,077 --> 00:34:11,976
<b>- Go ahead. - Okay.</b>

380
00:34:20,356 --> 00:34:21,726
<b>You must be psychic.</b>

381
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:23,827
<b>How did you know she'd come here?</b>

382
00:34:24,396 --> 00:34:25,526
<b>I'm glad.</b>

383
00:34:26,597 --> 00:34:27,626
<b>How is she?</b>

384
00:34:27,626 --> 00:34:29,697
<b>She looks terrible, naturally.</b>

385
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:31,796
<b>I think she wants to clear her head.</b>

386
00:34:32,336 --> 00:34:35,066
<b>Just come here if you're so worried.</b>

387
00:34:36,507 --> 00:34:37,807
<b>She probably wants to be alone.</b>

388
00:34:38,637 --> 00:34:40,776
<b>I'm in no position to intrude.</b>

389
00:34:42,376 --> 00:34:45,046
<b>Fine. I'll call you if anything happens.</b>

390
00:35:45,637 --> 00:35:46,677
<b>Sorry?</b>

391
00:35:47,146 --> 00:35:49,776
<b>Me? The associate director?</b>

392
00:35:50,077 --> 00:35:52,476
<b>There's no reason to keep it vacant any longer.</b>

393
00:35:52,947 --> 00:35:55,046
<b>That's what the chairperson and I decided.</b>

394
00:35:56,847 --> 00:35:58,456
<b>Don't you think you can handle it?</b>

395
00:35:59,017 --> 00:36:00,856
<b>Tell me now. I'll take it back.</b>

396
00:36:00,856 --> 00:36:02,327
<b>Of course, I can.</b>

397
00:36:03,796 --> 00:36:05,697
<b>I know I can be better than anyone.</b>

398
00:36:08,626 --> 00:36:12,097
<b>Thank you for having faith in me.</b>

399
00:36:13,336 --> 00:36:16,637
<b>I persuaded the chairperson myself.</b>

400
00:36:17,007 --> 00:36:19,336
<b>If by chance you cause trouble,</b>

401
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:22,106
<b>my neck is on the line too. Remember that.</b>

402
00:36:22,106 --> 00:36:25,546
<b>I'll do my best to make sure that does not happen.</b>

403
00:36:26,746 --> 00:36:27,746
<b>Also,</b>

404
00:36:28,117 --> 00:36:29,987
<b>what will you do about Dr. Ji?</b>

405
00:36:32,757 --> 00:36:35,586
<b>What can I do? She's the one who left.</b>

406
00:36:36,086 --> 00:36:38,057
<b>But she's the face of our hospital.</b>

407
00:36:38,057 --> 00:36:39,697
<b>We can't just let her go.</b>

408
00:36:40,496 --> 00:36:42,097
<b>The chairperson is troubled too...</b>

409
00:36:42,427 --> 00:36:44,767
<b>and says we'll never find someone as good.</b>

410
00:36:46,867 --> 00:36:49,367
<b>Why don't we wait a few days?</b>

411
00:36:49,637 --> 00:36:54,347
<b>The phone is turned off. Your call is being forwarded...</b>

<b>What brings you here?</b>

415
00:37:11,264 --> 00:37:13,235
<b>I was passing by, so I thought I'd drop in.</b>

<b>About Family Love Hospital.</b>

<b>I'm signing a sponsorship agreement.</b>

418
00:37:18,804 --> 00:37:21,014
<b>Meet with Dr. Kong when you have time...</b>

419

<b>and finish it up.</b>

420
00:37:24,715 --> 00:37:25,985
<b>Yes, sir.</b>

421
00:37:27,914 --> 00:37:29,585
<b>I thought it would take a while,</b>

422
00:37:30,355 --> 00:37:32,284
<b>but it was resolved quickly.</b>

423

<b>Good work.</b>

<b>Then...</b>

<b>I don't know either.</b>

<b>Why do you ask?</b>

<b>Hello?</b>

<b>- Why? - Do you know where she went?</b>

437
00:38:51,934 --> 00:38:53,565
<b>You both did enough.</b>

438
00:38:54,474 --> 00:38:55,735
<b>You harassed her enough.</b>

439

<b>With my parents too.</b>

<b>That's right. You did.</b>

<b>My dad usually hates sponsoring politicians,</b>

<b>I should.</b>

<b>What does it mean to you "to protect"?</b>

<b>It's poisonous for a parent and a child too.</b>

<b>I already gave up wanting to keep him by my side.</b>

00:42:34,324 --> 00:42:37,054
<b>You can't expect him to understand after hurting him.</b>

474
00:42:37,795 --> 00:42:39,494
<b>That would be too greedy.</b>

475
00:42:41,865 --> 00:42:43,795
<b>Whether it's hatred or resentment,</b>

476
00:42:44,164 --> 00:42:46,065
<b>you should respect Joon Young's feelings.</b>

477
00:42:48,175 --> 00:42:49,275
<b>Once you do that,</b>

478
00:42:51,105 --> 00:42:52,574
<b>time will take care of it.</b>

479
00:42:58,485 --> 00:43:00,545
<b>Did time take care of everything for you?</b>

480
00:43:03,855 --> 00:43:06,255
<b>Pain is still painful even after time passes.</b>

481
00:43:08,855 --> 00:43:10,255
<b>You know that too.</b>

482
00:43:14,295 --> 00:43:17,164
<b>Life can't be sweet all the time.</b>

483
00:43:18,065 --> 00:43:20,335
<b>You just somehow hang in there, that's all.</b>

484
00:43:22,275 --> 00:43:25,244
<b>Then you'll find some days to be sunny.</b>

485
00:43:28,445 --> 00:43:30,244
<b>That's how time will pass.</b>

486
00:43:30,985 --> 00:43:33,144
<b>I'm too tired to hang on.</b>

487
00:43:34,514 --> 00:43:36,014
<b>It'll be easier for everyone...</b>

488
00:43:38,425 --> 00:43:40,155
<b>if I disappear.</b>

489
00:43:43,025 --> 00:43:45,565
<b>For me, Joon Young,</b>

490
00:43:49,365 --> 00:43:50,465
<b>and Tae Oh too.</b>

491
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:31,804
<b>Wasn't my apology enough?</b>

492
00:44:31,905 --> 00:44:34,074
<b>Why do I have to make friends with him?</b>

493
00:44:34,644 --> 00:44:36,315
<b>I'm so annoyed.</b>

494
00:44:36,545 --> 00:44:38,844
<b>We're not asking you to force yourself to be friends.</b>

495
00:44:38,844 --> 00:44:41,514
<b>You still have to see each other at school for another year.</b>

496
00:44:44,255 --> 00:44:46,025
<b>It'd be better to be on good terms with him.</b>

497
00:44:54,365 --> 00:44:58,105
<b>Please just go with the flow for today.</b>

498
00:44:59,304 --> 00:45:01,574
<b>Da Kyung prepared today's gathering just for you.</b>

499
00:45:31,934 --> 00:45:34,505
<b>I referred to previous agreements we've had.</b>

500
00:45:34,505 --> 00:45:36,874
<b>We wrote a draft agreement.</b>

501
00:45:37,874 --> 00:45:39,545
<b>(Donation Agreement)</b>

502
00:45:39,545 --> 00:45:44,514
<b>At first, I thought your demands were out of the line.</b>

503
00:45:45,485 --> 00:45:49,014
<b>But it looks like you had a foresight.</b>

504
00:45:50,085 --> 00:45:53,025
<b>Dr. Ji caused a lot of problems lately.</b>

505
00:45:53,885 --> 00:45:56,324
<b>If she was still the associate director,</b>

506
00:45:56,894 --> 00:45:59,365
<b>it would have made things really difficult for the hospital.</b>

507
00:46:01,065 --> 00:46:03,434
<b>What are your plans for the agreement ceremony?</b>

508
00:46:03,695 --> 00:46:06,565
<b>- You must have an idea already. - I'm not sure.</b>

509
00:46:07,675 --> 00:46:08,974
<b>I don't have one yet.</b>

510
00:46:09,304 --> 00:46:12,175
<b>We're a small regional hospital,</b>

511
00:46:12,405 --> 00:46:15,574
<b>but TO Pictures is known all around the nation.</b>

512
00:46:15,815 --> 00:46:18,045
<b>You should pay attention to how you publish your articles.</b>

513
00:46:18,784 --> 00:46:22,615
<b>We should make a video and have it air on a local channel.</b>

514
00:46:23,115 --> 00:46:26,124
<b>It would hugely benefit both parties.</b>

515
00:46:26,124 --> 00:46:29,855
<b>I'll have our PR teams work closely together.</b>

516
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:33,795
<b>You must be busy. I'll get going.</b>

517
00:46:34,635 --> 00:46:36,494
<b>You should go if you're busy.</b>

518
00:47:02,755 --> 00:47:05,065
<b>(Doctor Ji Sun Woo)</b>

519
00:47:25,715 --> 00:47:28,885
<b>Sun Woo, where are you right now?</b>

520
00:47:30,885 --> 00:47:32,124
<b>Are you all right?</b>

521
00:47:33,855 --> 00:47:36,525
<b>The female customer from yesterday?</b>

522
00:47:37,454 --> 00:47:40,094
<b>She said she'll stay for a few days and paid in advance,</b>

523
00:47:40,094 --> 00:47:41,365
<b>but I saw her leaving at dawn.</b>

524
00:47:41,494 --> 00:47:42,635
<b>Dawn?</b>

525
00:47:42,965 --> 00:47:44,664
<b>- What time? - I don't know.</b>

526
00:47:45,164 --> 00:47:46,434
<b>Maybe around 6am.</b>

527
00:47:47,204 --> 00:47:48,835
<b>She must have gone out to see the sunrise.</b>

528
00:47:50,275 --> 00:47:51,374
<b>Why do you ask?</b>

529
00:47:51,744 --> 00:47:53,304
<b>Is there a problem?</b>

530
00:47:53,405 --> 00:47:55,844
<b>No. Thank you.</b>

531
00:48:03,985 --> 00:48:07,324
<b>The person you have reached is not available.</b>

532
00:48:13,465 --> 00:48:15,664
<b>I'm too tired to hang on.</b>

533
00:48:17,365 --> 00:48:18,764
<b>It'll be easier for everyone...</b>

534
00:48:21,235 --> 00:48:23,034
<b>if I disappear.</b>

535
00:48:35,715 --> 00:48:38,525
<b>Is Sun Woo well?</b>

536
00:48:39,085 --> 00:48:41,954
<b>Why do I feel like your tone sounds strange?</b>

537
00:48:42,994 --> 00:48:46,824
<b>What is it? Do you feel upset now that she's gone?</b>

538
00:48:48,295 --> 00:48:50,164
<b>Do you know where she is right now?</b>

539
00:48:52,505 --> 00:48:54,505
<b>I have an idea.</b>

540
00:48:55,835 --> 00:48:58,804
<b>- Why? Do you want to know? - No.</b>

541
00:48:59,874 --> 00:49:01,074
<b>It's fine as long as she's well.</b>

542
00:49:04,144 --> 00:49:06,085
<b>What's between you two?</b>

543
00:49:07,954 --> 00:49:11,554
<b>She was shocked after Joon Young's incident.</b>

544
00:49:12,184 --> 00:49:13,585
<b>She said she was going to leave,</b>

545
00:49:14,124 --> 00:49:16,324
<b>but she suddenly quit and disappeared.</b>

546
00:49:17,224 --> 00:49:18,465
<b>That worries me.</b>

547
00:49:19,664 --> 00:49:20,724
<b>I'm wondering...</b>

548
00:49:22,635 --> 00:49:24,465
<b>if something happened to her.</b>

549
00:49:29,574 --> 00:49:30,704
<b>I'm sure she's fine.</b>

550
00:49:36,675 --> 00:49:38,414
<b>Dr. Ji disappeared?</b>

551
00:49:39,184 --> 00:49:41,215
<b>I hope I'm just overly worried,</b>

552
00:49:42,355 --> 00:49:44,624
<b>but I can't ignore what's happening since I saw some signs.</b>

553
00:49:45,124 --> 00:49:46,454
<b>I think she might do something.</b>

554
00:49:47,784 --> 00:49:48,925
<b>I feel anxious.</b>

555
00:49:49,255 --> 00:49:50,394
<b>What should I do?</b>

556
00:50:06,005 --> 00:50:07,704
<b>Please cancel the rest of my appointments for today.</b>

557
00:50:07,704 --> 00:50:09,445
<b>- I'm sorry? - It's an emergency.</b>

558
00:50:09,675 --> 00:50:11,885
<b>Please ask the patients for their understanding.</b>

559
00:50:11,885 --> 00:50:14,414
<b>Tell them I'll call them personally later.</b>

560
00:50:14,414 --> 00:50:15,615
<b>What is it, Dr. Kim?</b>

561
00:50:16,784 --> 00:50:18,985
<b>Dr. Ma just called, and Dr. Ji...</b>

562
00:50:27,764 --> 00:50:29,394
<b>Did something happen to Sun Woo?</b>

563
00:50:32,235 --> 00:50:33,565
<b>Where is she right now?</b>

564
00:50:46,615 --> 00:50:47,684
<b>Where is she?</b>

565
00:50:48,615 --> 00:50:50,985
<b>- Tae Oh. - I said, where's Sun Woo right now?</b>

566
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:21,815
<b>(Dr. Ma)</b>

567
00:52:27,784 --> 00:52:29,155
<b>She's not here.</b>

568
00:52:30,115 --> 00:52:32,025
<b>But I don't know if that's a good thing or not.</b>

569
00:52:32,485 --> 00:52:33,985
<b>I can't seem to feel at ease.</b>

570
00:52:35,855 --> 00:52:37,255
<b>I'll also keep looking for her.</b>

571
00:56:19,715 --> 00:56:20,744
<b>Dr. Ji!</b>

572
00:56:22,454 --> 00:56:23,815
<b>Dr. Ji!</b>

573
00:56:30,724 --> 00:56:32,124
<b>Sun Woo!</b>

574
00:56:40,204 --> 00:56:42,175
<b>Sun Woo!</b>

575
00:57:00,624 --> 00:57:03,025
<b>Gosh, how could they leave their daughter behind like this?</b>

576
00:57:03,525 --> 00:57:05,994
<b>What a terrible accident.</b>

577
00:57:06,224 --> 00:57:08,094
<b>How is that little girl going to cope with this?</b>

578
00:57:08,094 --> 00:57:09,664
<b>I can't believe this happened to her.</b>

579
00:57:10,034 --> 00:57:11,934
<b>Don't you know the story? Her mother got shocked...</b>

580
00:57:11,934 --> 00:57:14,135
<b>after she found out about her husband's affair.</b>

581
00:57:14,465 --> 00:57:17,175
<b>I don't think it was an accident. I think she committed suicide.</b>

582
00:57:17,675 --> 00:57:19,675
<b>She committed suicide just because her husband cheated on her?</b>

583
00:57:20,005 --> 00:57:21,744
<b>I get how upset she must've been, but that's so wrong.</b>

584
00:57:21,744 --> 00:57:24,474
<b>She probably caused the car accident so they could die together.</b>

585
00:57:25,485 --> 00:57:26,744
<b>What an unbelievable woman.</b>

586
00:57:27,315 --> 00:57:29,355
<b>So she just abandoned her daughter?</b>

587
00:57:29,514 --> 00:57:33,624
<b>How could a mother leave her daughter behind like this?</b>

588
00:58:22,635 --> 00:58:23,675
<b>Sun Woo.</b>

589
00:59:44,155 --> 00:59:45,155
<b>Sun Woo.</b>

590
00:59:50,925 --> 00:59:53,824
<b>Sun Woo! Wake up!</b>

591
00:59:54,565 --> 00:59:55,565
<b>Sun Woo!</b>

592
00:59:57,965 --> 00:59:59,605
<b>Please wake up!</b>

593
01:00:00,505 --> 01:00:02,835
<b>Sun Woo! Are you okay?</b>

594
01:00:04,405 --> 01:00:06,545
<b>Okay, good. You're okay.</b>

595
01:00:16,054 --> 01:00:17,184
<b>Are you okay?</b>

596
01:00:26,894 --> 01:00:29,094
<b>Go ahead and cry. Just cry all you want.</b>

597
01:01:01,594 --> 01:01:02,835
<b>Cry all you want.</b>

598
01:01:48,601 --> 01:01:52,272
<b>Tae Oh's son started receiving therapy.</b>

599
01:01:53,112 --> 01:01:56,511
<b>I don't know if therapy will help though.</b>

600
01:01:56,811 --> 01:01:58,511
<b>Da Kyung is trying hard.</b>

601
01:01:59,052 --> 01:02:00,951
<b>We should hope for the best.</b>

602
01:02:01,112 --> 01:02:03,522
<b>We should. I know.</b>

603
01:02:03,851 --> 01:02:06,951
<b>I wondered why she was trying so hard for him,</b>

604
01:02:07,652 --> 01:02:09,822
<b>but seeing how Sun Woo backed off on her own,</b>

605
01:02:10,561 --> 01:02:12,362
<b>I feel like Da Kyung did the right thing.</b>

606
01:02:12,632 --> 01:02:17,101
<b>But seeing her struggling to take care of the ex-wife's son...</b>

607
01:02:17,862 --> 01:02:19,971
<b>makes my blood boil.</b>

608
01:02:22,302 --> 01:02:24,672
<b>I don't know what's good...</b>

609
01:02:25,371 --> 01:02:26,911
<b>or bad anymore.</b>

610
01:02:28,212 --> 01:02:29,311
<b>We'll be late.</b>

611
01:02:29,942 --> 01:02:31,342
<b>Let's go if you're ready.</b>

612
01:02:51,761 --> 01:02:54,172
<b>- Is everything ready? - Yes, it is.</b>

613
01:03:13,851 --> 01:03:16,121
<b>You scared me. I thought you were going to be late.</b>

614
01:03:19,462 --> 01:03:20,732
<b>I have time, right?</b>

615
01:03:22,831 --> 01:03:23,931
<b>I'm going to wash up.</b>

616
01:03:28,802 --> 01:03:30,541
<b>I put out your clothes.</b>

617
01:03:30,541 --> 01:03:31,772
<b>You can put them on.</b>

618
01:03:50,692 --> 01:03:51,962
<b>Are you ready?</b>

619
01:03:55,862 --> 01:03:59,402
<b>Grandma and Grandpa are good people,</b>

620
01:03:59,871 --> 01:04:01,272
<b>so don't be too nervous.</b>

621
01:04:04,302 --> 01:04:07,011
<b>Be polite to the adults, okay?</b>

622
01:04:11,712 --> 01:04:12,811
<b>Joon Young.</b>

623
01:04:13,882 --> 01:04:15,581
<b>We're really a family now.</b>

624
01:04:17,451 --> 01:04:18,951
<b>You understand what I mean, right?</b>

625
01:04:57,721 --> 01:04:59,261
<b>- Please enjoy. - Thank you.</b>

626
01:04:59,692 --> 01:05:02,701
<b>Da Kyung, you must have worked so hard.</b>

627
01:05:02,701 --> 01:05:03,802
<b>Not at all.</b>

628

<b>Joon Young. Hae Kang.</b>

01:05:08,302 --> 01:05:12,101
<b>You know how they say kids fight as they grow?</b>

630
01:05:12,572 --> 01:05:13,772
<b>That's a lie.</b>

631
01:05:13,871 --> 01:05:16,882
<b>You need to fight and make up.</b>

632
01:05:17,112 --> 01:05:20,152
<b>That's how you grow tall like your dads.</b>

633
01:05:21,411 --> 01:05:22,451
<b>You're totally right.</b>

634
01:05:22,581 --> 01:05:26,791
<b>Boys only grow closer if they've thrown a few punches.</b>

635
01:05:27,121 --> 01:05:28,692
<b>Thank you for your wise words.</b>

636
01:05:29,121 --> 01:05:33,132
<b>Thank you for inviting us to this precious dinner...</b>

637
01:05:33,291 --> 01:05:35,532
<b>- and the precious food. - Thank you, sir.</b>

638
01:05:35,532 --> 01:05:38,002
<b>Let's toast to their friendship.</b>

639
01:05:38,261 --> 01:05:40,132
<b>- What do you think? - Sounds good.</b>

640
01:05:40,371 --> 01:05:43,971
<b>Here's to Lee Joon Young and Cha Hae Kang's friendship.</b>

641
01:05:44,502 --> 01:05:46,311
<b>- Cheers. - Cheers.</b>

642
01:05:49,811 --> 01:05:52,482
<b>The wine is delicious.</b>

643
01:05:52,482 --> 01:05:53,581
<b>Isn't it?</b>

644
01:05:53,581 --> 01:05:56,882
<b>Speaking of wines, a new wine bar opened...</b>

645
01:05:57,121 --> 01:05:59,022
<b>in the shopping district.</b>

646
01:05:59,092 --> 01:06:00,422
<b>It's nice.</b>

647
01:06:00,422 --> 01:06:03,721
<b>I have a friend, Sang Hyun,</b>

648
01:06:03,791 --> 01:06:05,322
<b>who opened a wine bar.</b>

649
01:06:05,391 --> 01:06:07,032
<b>I'll take you sometime.</b>

650
01:06:11,032 --> 01:06:13,632
<b>I don't know if I got lucky with a good friend...</b>

651
01:06:13,632 --> 01:06:15,702
<b>or with a good son,</b>

652
01:06:16,001 --> 01:06:20,011
<b>but it's an honor to have the best sponsor in Gosan, sir.</b>

653
01:06:21,511 --> 01:06:24,841
<b>Let's say you got lucky with both a good friend and a good son.</b>

654
01:06:26,082 --> 01:06:29,952
<b>Since I'm sponsoring you anyway, I hope you win, Councilman Cha.</b>

655
01:06:31,322 --> 01:06:32,452
<b>Thank you.</b>

656
01:06:34,091 --> 01:06:35,251
<b>I'll do my best.</b>

657
01:06:36,091 --> 01:06:37,322
<b>Thank you.</b>

658
01:06:42,391 --> 01:06:44,101
<b>Is everything going well for the groundbreaking ceremony?</b>

659
01:06:44,561 --> 01:06:45,662
<b>Of course.</b>

660
01:06:45,662 --> 01:06:47,702
<b>The laborers are the ones who prepare for construction.</b>

661
01:06:48,202 --> 01:06:49,702
<b>When is the next movie coming out?</b>

662
01:06:49,942 --> 01:06:51,872
<b>You need to make another blockbuster.</b>

663
01:06:52,442 --> 01:06:53,572
<b>I'm working on it.</b>

664
01:06:58,811 --> 01:07:01,582
<b>That's odd. The housekeeper should be with her.</b>

665
01:07:01,711 --> 01:07:02,782
<b>Excuse me.</b>

666
01:07:34,181 --> 01:07:35,251
<b>Are you okay?</b>

667
01:07:35,612 --> 01:07:36,751
<b>What did you do?</b>

668
01:07:46,832 --> 01:07:48,461
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

669
01:07:48,862 --> 01:07:51,162
<b>- I stepped away for a minute. - Take her.</b>

670
01:07:55,631 --> 01:07:57,202
<b>Did you do something to Jenny?</b>

671
01:07:57,902 --> 01:07:59,311
<b>I didn't do anything.</b>

672
01:08:00,171 --> 01:08:02,072
<b>- She was alone, so... - Did you hit her?</b>

673
01:08:13,891 --> 01:08:14,952
<b>I did everything for you.</b>

674
01:08:15,652 --> 01:08:16,761
<b>You have everything now.</b>

675
01:08:16,761 --> 01:08:19,362
<b>You should be adjusted by now!</b>

676
01:08:20,261 --> 01:08:22,761
<b>Couldn't you behave for just one day?</b>

677
01:08:23,061 --> 01:08:24,601
<b>What's the problem?</b>

678
01:08:24,601 --> 01:08:26,272
<b>What did I do wrong?</b>

679
01:08:26,801 --> 01:08:29,442
<b>- Joon Young, stop it. - I didn't do anything.</b>

680
01:08:29,572 --> 01:08:31,702
<b>She fell while she was alone. What do you want from me?</b>

681
01:08:31,702 --> 01:08:33,072
<b>Why are you taking it out on me?</b>

682
01:08:33,742 --> 01:08:36,112
<b>We have guests downstairs. Stop it.</b>

683
01:08:36,442 --> 01:08:38,681
<b>How patient must I be with you?</b>

684
01:08:39,952 --> 01:08:41,612
<b>How much must I take?</b>

685
01:08:41,612 --> 01:08:43,482
<b>Cry all you wanWhen did I ask you for your patience?</b>

686
01:08:45,622 --> 01:08:46,692
<b>Honey.</b>

687
01:08:54,992 --> 01:08:56,131
<b>Do what you can...</b>

688
01:08:57,532 --> 01:08:58,702
<b>to console him.</b>

689
01:08:59,931 --> 01:09:01,471
<b>Make sure this doesn't end up...</b>

690
01:09:02,801 --> 01:09:04,171
<b>hurting him even more.</b>

691
01:09:06,412 --> 01:09:07,641
<b>That's all...</b>

692
01:09:08,572 --> 01:09:09,782
<b>I want.</b>

693
01:09:15,181 --> 01:09:16,322
<b>You jerk.</b>

694
01:09:17,221 --> 01:09:18,421
<b>Get your act together.</b>

695
01:09:19,652 --> 01:09:22,122
<b>How many people must suffer because of you?</b>

696
01:09:22,429 --> 01:09:24,498
<b>How much harder must it get for us?</b>

697
01:09:37,379 --> 01:09:38,509
<b>What happened?</b>

698
01:09:42,349 --> 01:09:43,479

<b>Mom.</b>

<b>Are you listening?</b>

707
01:12:32,818 --> 01:12:34,049

<b>but can you come and pick me up?</b>

711
01:13:10,858 --> 01:13:11,959
<b>Dr. Ji.</b>

712
01:13:17,929 --> 01:13:20,599
<b>What did I tell you?</b>

713
01:13:21,929 --> 01:13:24,438
<b>I told you not to take in someone else's child.</b>

714
01:13:25,698 --> 01:13:28,038
<b>Why are you wasting your energy?</b>

715

<b>Da Kyung.</b>

<b>What's making you...</b>

717

<b>so anxious?</b>

718
01:14:33,568 --> 01:14:34,608
<b>Madam.</b>

<b>Gosh.</b>

720
01:14:43,019 --> 01:14:45,349
<b>Is she out of her mind? How dare she come here?</b>

721
01:14:52,059 --> 01:14:54,559
<b>Gosh. Didn't she leave Gosan?</b>

722
01:15:00,429 --> 01:15:03,299
<b>No. Don't deal with her. Just make her leave.</b>

723
01:15:06,738 --> 01:15:09,438
<b>(Call)</b>

724
01:15:11,209 --> 01:15:12,408
<b>What is it?</b>

725
01:15:12,908 --> 01:15:14,309
<b>I came to get Joon Young.</b>

726
01:15:17,118 --> 01:15:18,278
<b>Why all of a sudden?</b>

727
01:15:20,188 --> 01:15:22,188
<b>I didn't hear anything from Tae Oh.</b>

728

<b>Joon Young, hurry up and come out.</b>

<b>Stop right there, Lee Joon Young!</b>

<b>Go back to your room right now.</b>

732
01:16:01,089 --> 01:16:02,688
<b>I said, go back to your room!</b>

733
01:16:12,368 --> 01:16:13,568
<b>Da Kyung, stop it.</b>

734
01:16:14,538 --> 01:16:16,908
<b>- Move. - Just let him go!</b>

735
01:16:17,509 --> 01:16:19,908
<b>Dad, stop him from leaving.</b>

736
01:16:20,209 --> 01:16:21,608
<b>I have to make that crazy woman go away.</b>

<b>- Just let him go! - Let go of me!</b>

738
01:16:26,748 --> 01:16:28,248
<b>Do you know how hard I tried?</b>

739
01:16:29,188 --> 01:16:30,788
<b>I put in so much effort.</b>

740
01:16:32,318 --> 01:16:34,229
<b>- You know it, don't you? - I do.</b>

741
01:16:36,358 --> 01:16:37,599
<b>I'm almost there.</b>

742
01:16:38,259 --> 01:16:40,368
<b>I can't let that woman ruin it.</b>

743

<b>Yeo Da Kyung!</b>

744
01:17:03,818 --> 01:17:04,919
<b>I'm sorry...</b>

745
01:17:05,719 --> 01:17:07,188
<b>I came so late.</b>

746
01:17:08,158 --> 01:17:10,059
<b>Let's hurry and leave, Mom.</b>

747
01:17:10,358 --> 01:17:11,599
<b>Okay, let's go.</b>

748
01:17:14,799 --> 01:17:16,169
<b>I said, stop right there!</b>

749
01:17:18,769 --> 01:17:20,038
<b>Wait in the car.</b>

750
01:17:35,049 --> 01:17:36,248
<b>What's the problem?</b>

751
01:17:37,759 --> 01:17:40,959
<b>It'll be easier for you if Joon Young stays with me.</b>

752
01:17:41,729 --> 01:17:43,229
<b>Does Tae Oh know about this?</b>

753
01:17:43,358 --> 01:17:46,828
<b>We already agreed that I'd take Joon Young back...</b>

754
01:17:48,328 --> 01:17:49,629
<b>whenever he wanted.</b>

755
01:17:50,099 --> 01:17:51,868
<b>Your obsession...</b>

756
01:17:55,009 --> 01:17:57,408
<b>is ruining Joon Young. Don't you know that?</b>

757
01:18:01,408 --> 01:18:03,618
<b>How much more will you confuse him?</b>

758
01:18:03,618 --> 01:18:05,849
<b>He was stabilizing.</b>

759
01:18:07,049 --> 01:18:08,889
<b>Instead of being with his unstable and obsessive mom,</b>

760
01:18:08,889 --> 01:18:11,089
<b>it's better for him to grow up in a normal family.</b>

761
01:18:13,589 --> 01:18:15,828
<b>You should think rationally.</b>

762
01:18:24,068 --> 01:18:26,269
<b>Why are you obsessed with Joon Young?</b>

763
01:18:28,068 --> 01:18:30,009
<b>Because this is what's best for him.</b>

764
01:18:31,839 --> 01:18:33,948
<b>You two keep on fighting with Joon Young in the middle.</b>

765
01:18:33,948 --> 01:18:35,108
<b>It even tires me out.</b>

766
01:18:37,879 --> 01:18:39,219
<b>It must be tougher on Joon Young.</b>

767
01:18:40,818 --> 01:18:42,089
<b>Also,</b>

768
01:18:43,988 --> 01:18:45,459
<b>you're not normal.</b>

769
01:18:47,429 --> 01:18:49,358
<b>Are you sure you can raise him properly?</b>

770
01:18:49,358 --> 01:18:51,799
<b>I was the one who stopped the School Violence Committee.</b>

771
01:18:53,528 --> 01:18:54,568
<b>Am I wrong?</b>

772
01:18:58,538 --> 01:19:00,009
<b>Let's be honest.</b>

773
01:19:02,139 --> 01:19:03,778
<b>You're not doing this for Joon Young.</b>

774
01:19:03,778 --> 01:19:06,849
<b>It's your marriage and family you want to protect.</b>

775
01:19:07,908 --> 01:19:10,078
<b>You're nervous because...</b>

776
01:19:11,549 --> 01:19:12,849
<b>you can see Tae Oh's temptation.</b>

777
01:19:19,019 --> 01:19:21,959
<b>I understand how much you wanted to protect it.</b>

778
01:19:21,959 --> 01:19:23,328
<b>I was the same.</b>

779
01:19:27,469 --> 01:19:28,698
<b>But do you know this?</b>

780
01:19:30,198 --> 01:19:33,368
<b>Such earnest desperation...</b>

781
01:19:34,709 --> 01:19:36,339
<b>is meaningless.</b>

782
01:19:39,479 --> 01:19:42,078
<b>A marriage and a couple...</b>

783
01:19:46,219 --> 01:19:48,188
<b>can get shook up,</b>

784
01:19:49,648 --> 01:19:52,419
<b>flipped around, or break apart over nothing.</b>

785
01:19:54,658 --> 01:19:55,759
<b>As for me...</b>

786
01:19:59,259 --> 01:20:00,799
<b>My marriage is different.</b>

787
01:20:03,969 --> 01:20:05,438
