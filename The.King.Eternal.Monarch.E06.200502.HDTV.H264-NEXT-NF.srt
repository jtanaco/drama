7

<b>At this hour?</b>

8

<b>This is a very personal occasion.</b>

26
00:01:27,124 --> 00:01:28,959
<b>I should have given you a heads-up</b>

45
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:34,107
<b>I studied liberal arts.</b>

46

<b>Let's call it a day, Prime Minister Koo.</b>

47

<b>I don't have much time today.</b>

48

<b>-Let's go.
-Okay.</b>

<b>Are you worried

<b>Do you also have...</b>

63
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:19,796
<b>Later.</b>

64
00:04:28,555 --> 00:04:29,431
<b>What?</b>

65
00:04:36,938 --> 00:04:38,106
<i><b>Do we also have what?</i></b>

66
00:04:44,988 --> 00:04:48,116
<i><b>Do you also have the myth
about rabbits living on the moon?</i></b>

67
00:04:54,539 --> 00:04:56,833
<i><b>There are no rabbits on the moon,

68
00:04:57,417 --> 00:04:59,544
<i><b>The moon is

<i><b>The surface of the moon

<b>I smile for you. But you...</b>

71
00:05:36,748 --> 00:05:38,792
<b>You smile at moments like that.</b>

72
00:06:07,654 --> 00:06:08,697
<b>Why are we in the kitchen?</b>

73
00:06:09,239 --> 00:06:11,324
<b>Are you going to have me sleep
here tonight?</b>

74
00:06:12,951 --> 00:06:15,328
<b>If you're staying the night,
I will have you sleep in my bedroom.</b>

75

<b>Now that Secretary Mo knows,
almost everyone around me knows about you.</b>

76

<b>Let's eat.</b>

77
00:06:26,214 --> 00:06:27,340
<b>Yeong told me</b>

78
00:06:27,424 --> 00:06:30,010
<b>that you didn't eat anything
but one sandwich the whole day.</b>

79
00:06:35,098 --> 00:06:36,141
<b>I'm repaying you</b>

80
00:06:37,058 --> 00:06:38,184
<b>for the half and half.</b>

81
00:07:10,717 --> 00:07:12,761
<b>You didn't give me money
on purpose, right?</b>

82
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:14,971
<b>You knew we had different currencies.</b>

83
00:07:16,348 --> 00:07:17,182
<b>Right.</b>

84
00:07:18,016 --> 00:07:19,392
<b>You don't have buttons.</b>

85
00:07:23,146 --> 00:07:24,606
<b>I didn't want you to go far away.</b>

86
00:07:25,523 --> 00:07:26,775
<b>That's why I sent Yeong.</b>

87
00:07:30,028 --> 00:07:31,404
<b>The credit limit was 100,000 won.</b>

88
00:07:32,113 --> 00:07:33,865
<b>I borrowed it from him,
so pay it back for me.</b>

89
00:07:34,657 --> 00:07:35,658
<b>I will.</b>

90
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:41,456
<b>I was</b>

91
00:07:42,207 --> 00:07:44,417
<b>traveling around today,</b>

92
00:07:47,462 --> 00:07:50,256
<b>and I realized you must have been
lonely in my world.</b>

93
00:07:54,094 --> 00:07:56,429
<b>Were you lonely here?</b>

94
00:07:57,389 --> 00:07:59,724
<b>It was frustrating to not have something</b>

95
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:02,394
<b>that could prove my identity.</b>

96
00:08:03,353 --> 00:08:04,687
<b>Thanks for coming to pick me up.</b>

97
00:08:07,065 --> 00:08:08,316
<b>Would you come here for a second?</b>

98
00:08:14,406 --> 00:08:15,865
<b>-Do you need any help?
-Look at me.</b>

99
00:08:22,455 --> 00:08:25,417
<b>I want to pat your head,
but both my hands are busy.</b>

100
00:08:31,339 --> 00:08:33,591
<b>It doesn't seem like your first time.</b>

101
00:08:34,342 --> 00:08:36,302
<b>What do you mean? Dating?</b>

102
00:08:36,553 --> 00:08:38,596
<b>Why? You didn't get any results
from web-searching?</b>

103
00:08:42,308 --> 00:08:43,601
<b>Why do you cook so well?</b>

104
00:08:44,185 --> 00:08:45,812
<b>I thought you were making me
some instant noodles.</b>

105
00:08:45,937 --> 00:08:47,105
<b>You said it didn't taste good.</b>

106
00:08:47,939 --> 00:08:48,982
<b>It was good.</b>

107
00:08:50,358 --> 00:08:53,069
<b>That's why I didn't believe
that you cooked it yourself.</b>

108
00:08:53,653 --> 00:08:55,321
<b>Head Court Lady Noh taught me how to cook.</b>

109
00:08:57,115 --> 00:09:00,076
<b>The only food that I don't have to
have tasted is the food I cooked.</b>

110
00:09:01,536 --> 00:09:02,704
<b>I saw you looked it up online.</b>

111
00:09:03,371 --> 00:09:05,498
<b>"Prince Imperial Geum" and "Lee Lim."</b>

112
00:09:14,424 --> 00:09:15,300
<b>You...</b>

113
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:18,428
<b>seem to have grown into a fine man.</b>

114
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:28,897
<b>I guess you now know</b>

115
00:09:30,565 --> 00:09:32,692
<b>what root you are standing in front of.</b>

116
00:09:43,953 --> 00:09:44,954
<b>It's my hell</b>

00:09:45,997 --> 00:09:47,081
<b>and my history</b>

118
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:50,210
<b>that was engraved on my body</b>

119
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:54,631
<b>by the greed of the person
that killed my father and strangled me.</b>

120
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:59,177
<b>Which is why I was raised
amid my uncle's worries</b>

121
00:09:59,427 --> 00:10:01,179
<b>and Head Court Lady Noh's tears.</b>

122
00:10:02,472 --> 00:10:05,266
<b>And that's the reason
why Head Court Lady Noh isn't nice to you.</b>

123
00:10:06,184 --> 00:10:07,477
<b>Don't be upset about it.</b>

124
00:10:11,439 --> 00:10:12,607
<b>Is that it?</b>

125
00:10:13,358 --> 00:10:17,111
<b>After hearing a story like this,
don't you have to either give me a hug</b>

126
00:10:17,695 --> 00:10:19,239
<b>or at least say you would give me one?</b>

127
00:10:26,788 --> 00:10:29,207
<b>Aren't you going to show me my ID card?</b>

128
00:10:32,001 --> 00:10:33,253
<b>I need to go now.</b>

129
00:10:39,259 --> 00:10:40,301
<b>I won't let you go.</b>

130
00:10:41,761 --> 00:10:43,054
<b>You have to live here.</b>

131
00:10:46,182 --> 00:10:47,892
<b>I'm serious. I won't let you go.</b>

132
00:10:49,561 --> 00:10:50,728
<b>I can keep you here</b>

133
00:10:54,148 --> 00:10:55,316
<b>with just one command.</b>

134
00:11:07,912 --> 00:11:08,913
<b>What are you doing?</b>

135
00:11:09,539 --> 00:11:10,915
<b>Well, I heard from the news earlier</b>

136
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:13,751
<b>that there will be a cold wave
starting from tonight.</b>

137
00:11:14,752 --> 00:11:17,213
<b>It'd be nice to take you to my place,
but you won't.</b>

138
00:11:18,798 --> 00:11:20,717
<b>Can I not watch the news
in the night duty room?</b>

139
00:11:21,426 --> 00:11:23,636
<b>My mom bought this

<b>It doesn't mean she's into it.
She only purchased their product.</b>

00:23:43,625 --> 00:23:46,128
<b>They are just throwing a tantrum
before the trade negotiation.</b>

308
00:23:46,211 --> 00:23:48,464
<b>War isn't easy.</b>

309
00:23:48,797 --> 00:23:50,799
<b>Let's make more warning announcements
and wait.</b>

310
00:23:50,883 --> 00:23:52,009
<b>Wait for what?</b>

311
00:23:52,426 --> 00:23:53,761
<b>Did we order food?</b>

312
00:23:56,555 --> 00:23:59,641
<b>The Japanese Navy is now sailing toward
our territorial waters.</b>

313
00:23:59,933 --> 00:24:02,478
<b>At this rate, they will enter
our territorial waters in 20 minutes.</b>

314
00:24:02,978 --> 00:24:03,854
<b>You all heard that.</b>

315
00:24:05,022 --> 00:24:08,108
<b>If you want to wait,
do so when you become the Prime Minister.</b>

316
00:24:08,859 --> 00:24:10,611
<b>I will not stand anymore.</b>

317
00:24:11,653 --> 00:24:13,614
<b>I want all the troops
to prepare for action.</b>

318
00:24:13,697 --> 00:24:14,740
<b>Prime Minister Koo.</b>

319
00:24:14,823 --> 00:24:17,242
<b>You know we need
the permission of His Majesty.</b>

320
00:24:17,326 --> 00:24:18,660
<b>I do.</b>

321
00:24:19,203 --> 00:24:20,204

325
00:24:28,754 --> 00:24:31,006
<i><b>Of course, there is a lot of opposition.</i></b>

326
00:24:31,173 --> 00:24:33,717
<b>Politics must not be considered

<i><b>No political idea was taken into account.</i></b>

<b>If you say so,
I was thinking of a different approach.</b>

<i><b>By "a different approach," do you mean...</i></b>

332
00:24:49,233 --> 00:24:51,151
<b>I will do just as my ancestors did.</b>

333

<b>Your Majesty.</b>

334
00:24:52,778 --> 00:24:55,072
<b>When two countries are true to themselves,

335

<b>Japan is true to themselves,</b>

336
00:24:58,367 --> 00:24:59,952
<b>so we must be true to ourselves too.</b>

337

343
00:25:27,396 --> 00:25:30,524
<b>The guest's ID card is gone.</b>

344
00:25:32,359 --> 00:25:35,487
<b>I tried my best to keep it secure,

<b>Head Court Lady Noh.</b>

347
00:25:40,951 --> 00:25:42,619
<b>I know this might sound odd,</b>

348
00:25:44,037 --> 00:25:46,290
<b>and I can't explain why,</b>

349

351
00:25:54,423 --> 00:25:58,927
<b>Why are you suddenly saying that?</b>

352
00:26:00,804 --> 00:26:02,347
<b>I will explain further when I get back.</b>

353
00:26:03,348 --> 00:26:05,851
<b>Just wish me good luck for now.</b>

354

00:27:14,795 --> 00:27:16,505
<b>I left the military as a Navy Lieutenant.</b>

408
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:29,118
<b>I even made him coffee.</b>

409

00:54:13,374 --> 00:54:16,210
<b>When you're like this,
you're still a baby.</b>

762
00:54:16,961 --> 00:54:19,339
<b>I don't understand
how you even go to the battlefield.</b>

763
00:54:22,967 --> 00:54:25,094
<b>Will you tell me</b>

764
00:54:25,762 --> 00:54:28,514
<b>what you said you would tell me now
or should I wait?</b>

765
00:54:30,892 --> 00:54:32,101
<b>Did Uncle Buyeong</b>

766
00:54:33,227 --> 00:54:34,145
<b>call?</b>

767
00:54:35,146 --> 00:54:37,899
<b>He came back from the conference.</b>

768
00:54:37,982 --> 00:54:41,444
<b>I called him and said
you came back to the palace safely.</b>

769
00:54:41,527 --> 00:54:43,738
<b>Then he said, "That's good"
and hung up the phone.</b>

770
00:54:47,075 --> 00:54:48,868
<b>You taste all my food,</b>

771
00:54:49,786 --> 00:54:51,329
<b>examine every cloth,</b>

772
00:54:52,413 --> 00:54:55,041
<b>every piece of furniture,
and every item that comes into the palace.</b>

773
00:54:55,249 --> 00:54:58,002
<b>And you suspect every person
that enters the palace to protect me.</b>

774
00:54:58,086 --> 00:54:59,253
<b>You also</b>

775
00:55:00,129 --> 00:55:01,381
<b>hid the Manpasikjeok in the whip</b>

776
00:55:02,090 --> 00:55:03,091
<b>and protected it.</b>

777
00:55:04,884 --> 00:55:05,843
<b>May I ask why?</b>

778
00:55:06,427 --> 00:55:07,261
<b>Well...</b>

779
00:55:07,929 --> 00:55:11,182
<b>It's just what I had to do, Your Majesty.</b>

780
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:14,894
<b>What the traitor, Lee Lim,</b>

781
00:55:15,269 --> 00:55:18,231
<b>tried to steal that night
was the Manpasikjeok.</b>

782
00:55:18,731 --> 00:55:20,108
<b>So I had to protect it.</b>

783
00:55:20,942 --> 00:55:23,152
<b>I had to hide it from him.</b>

784
00:55:25,071 --> 00:55:30,118
<b>When Lee Lim's dead body was found,</b>

785
00:55:30,201 --> 00:55:34,664
<b>the first thing I did was
to look for the other half.</b>

786
00:55:35,623 --> 00:55:36,791
<b>But I failed to find it.</b>

787
00:55:37,875 --> 00:55:41,713
<b>I heard the corpse was drifting
in the sea for quite some time.</b>

788
00:55:42,213 --> 00:55:45,174
<b>I told myself that it must have gone back
to the Dragon King of the East Sea</b>

789
00:55:46,134 --> 00:55:48,803
<b>just like the myth.</b>

790
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:51,514
<b>And it relieved me.</b>

791
00:55:52,098 --> 00:55:52,932
<b>I'm also</b>

792
00:55:54,308 --> 00:55:55,935
<b>relying on a myth.</b>

793
00:55:57,186 --> 00:55:59,105
<b>That's why I'm waiting for Uncle Buyeong.</b>

794
00:56:01,357 --> 00:56:03,484
<b>I'm not telling you the stories in detail</b>

795
00:56:04,527 --> 00:56:06,946
<b>not because I want to hide it
but because I don't know yet.</b>

796
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:08,239
<b>So I want you</b>

797
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:10,199
<b>to find the thief</b>

798
00:56:11,409 --> 00:56:12,952
<b>while I am looking for something else.</b>

799
00:56:13,745 --> 00:56:15,413
<b>Yes, Your Majesty.</b>

800
00:56:16,539 --> 00:56:18,124
<b>I will find the thief.</b>

801
00:56:23,337 --> 00:56:26,466
<b>There's no match to the fingerprint?</b>

802
00:56:27,133 --> 00:56:28,092
<i><b>No. Nothing at all.</i></b>

803
00:56:28,968 --> 00:56:31,304
<i><b>Does the fingerprint
belong to a foreigner?</i></b>

804
00:56:33,723 --> 00:56:34,640
<b>Then...</b>

805
00:56:38,311 --> 00:56:40,605
<b>Did you catch the woman called Luna?</b>

806
00:56:41,773 --> 00:56:42,899
<i><b>Well, not yet.</i></b>

807
00:56:43,941 --> 00:56:46,194
<i><b>Why is the Royal Court
looking for Luna though?</i></b>

808
00:56:46,652 --> 00:56:48,905
<b>It's confidential.
Please be understanding.</b>

809
00:56:49,781 --> 00:56:51,866
<b>Did you get the CCTV footage
that I asked before?</b>

810
00:56:52,867 --> 00:56:53,951
<b>Yes, I did. But...</b>

811
00:56:54,827 --> 00:56:57,955
<b>I'm not sure if I can say
I have the footage or not, though.</b>

812
00:56:58,039 --> 00:56:59,874
<b>They don't show anything interesting.</b>

813
00:57:00,833 --> 00:57:03,586
<b>She seems to know
where exactly the CCTVs are.</b>

814
00:57:04,295 --> 00:57:05,713
<i><b>None of them show her front face.</i></b>

815
00:57:06,422 --> 00:57:08,674
<b>Okay. I will call you back.</b>

816
00:57:10,885 --> 00:57:11,969
<b>Please hold on.</b>

817
00:57:16,557 --> 00:57:17,809
<b>Let me take a picture of you.</b>

818
00:57:18,518 --> 00:57:19,685
<b>It's for the security.</b>

819
00:57:25,316 --> 00:57:26,859
<b>What just happened?</b>

820
00:57:27,443 --> 00:57:28,528
<b>Tell me about it.</b>

821
00:57:30,238 --> 00:57:31,155
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

822
00:57:31,447 --> 00:57:32,782
<b>Why are you sorry?</b>

823
00:57:34,450 --> 00:57:35,952
<b>Isn't my lipstick color weird now?</b>

824
00:57:36,619 --> 00:57:39,247
<b>I think he's trying
to take pictures of me. Unbelievable.</b>

825
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:40,373
<b>I don't think so.</b>

826
00:57:40,957 --> 00:57:43,626
<b>You don't know. That's what it is.</b>

827
00:57:43,709 --> 00:57:45,336
<b>I think I know him better than you do.</b>

828
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:46,963
<b>I'm his uncle.</b>

829
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:48,714
<b>What?</b>

830
00:57:59,559 --> 00:58:02,228
<b>Could you please zoom in Camera 21?</b>

831
00:58:02,562 --> 00:58:03,688
<b>Okay.</b>

832
00:58:15,992 --> 00:58:17,869
<b>Is the person you were chasing,
Luna, here?</b>

833
00:58:17,952 --> 00:58:18,786
<b>Then tell me which.</b>

834
00:58:23,207 --> 00:58:24,292
<b>This is her.</b>

835
00:58:24,375 --> 00:58:26,836
<b>This is Luna.</b>

836
00:58:26,919 --> 00:58:29,130
<b>Goodness. Look.</b>

837
00:58:29,213 --> 00:58:32,008
<b>Look how wealthy she looks now
after stealing others' money. Gosh.</b>

838
00:58:32,466 --> 00:58:33,885
<b>Where is she now?</b>

839
00:58:33,968 --> 00:58:36,512
<b>Tell me when you find her, okay?</b>

840
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:40,516
<b>You and I aren't too different.
We both use force to do our jobs.</b>

841
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:41,559
<b>You are the Royal Guard!</b>

842
00:58:42,393 --> 00:58:43,227
<b>And I'm a gangster!</b>

843
00:58:44,353 --> 00:58:46,147
<b>Are you out of your mind?</b>

844
00:58:48,065 --> 00:58:50,651
<b>My world has just collapsed, you prick.</b>

845
00:59:15,259 --> 00:59:17,178
<b>Yeong, is everything all right?</b>

846
00:59:18,554 --> 00:59:20,139
<b>You came to work late today.</b>

847
00:59:20,973 --> 00:59:21,974
<b>Everything is all right.</b>

848
00:59:24,894 --> 00:59:26,479
<b>Should I come back later, Your Majesty?</b>

849
00:59:26,562 --> 00:59:27,855
<b>That might be better.</b>

850
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:33,819
<b>Gosh.</b>

851
00:59:35,029 --> 00:59:36,155
<b>My neck hurts.</b>

852
00:59:37,782 --> 00:59:38,824
<b>I know something is up.</b>

853
00:59:40,076 --> 00:59:41,202
<b>What is it?</b>

854
00:59:46,582 --> 00:59:48,042
<b>What is this?</b>

855
00:59:48,668 --> 00:59:49,835
<b>What strangled your wrist?</b>

856
00:59:50,795 --> 00:59:52,964
<b>Is it the same kind of wound
as the one on your shoulder?</b>

857
00:59:53,381 --> 00:59:54,215
<b>No.</b>

858
00:59:54,423 --> 00:59:55,800
<b>This is not that.</b>

859
00:59:56,592 --> 00:59:58,094
<b>This mark shows that</b>

860
00:59:58,844 --> 01:00:00,846
<b>there's someone
who comes in and out of my heart.</b>

861
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:03,724
<b>It's kind of tight though.</b>

862
01:00:04,225 --> 01:00:05,768
<b>As if my heart is going to burst.</b>

863
01:00:10,690 --> 01:00:13,943
<b>Your Majesty, Prince Buyeong
has just entered the palace.</b>

864
01:00:15,861 --> 01:00:16,946
<b>Where is he now?</b>

865
01:00:19,115 --> 01:00:21,033
<b>How was the conference?</b>

866
01:00:22,201 --> 01:00:23,411
<b>It was a mess.</b>

867
01:00:23,786 --> 01:00:25,955
<b>I couldn't focus on the presentation</b>

868
01:00:26,747 --> 01:00:29,208
<b>because you were on the battlefield.</b>

869
01:00:31,919 --> 01:00:33,379
<b>Please stay healthy.</b>

870
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:37,258
<b>You know you are the only one I have.</b>

871
01:00:37,883 --> 01:00:38,759
<b>That's why</b>

872
01:00:39,343 --> 01:00:42,680
<b>it's a very precious and sad life.</b>

873
01:00:43,347 --> 01:00:44,307
<b>For me</b>

874
01:00:44,765 --> 01:00:45,766
<b>and you.</b>

875
01:00:47,393 --> 01:00:49,353
<b>That is why</b>

876
01:00:49,937 --> 01:00:53,232
<b>I wished you would never ask me
about that incident.</b>

877
01:00:54,525 --> 01:00:55,401
<b>But at the same time,</b>

878
01:00:55,901 --> 01:00:59,864
<b>I knew you would ask me about it someday.</b>

879
01:01:00,948 --> 01:01:04,410
<b>About the traitor Lee Lim's
real cause of death.</b>

880
01:01:11,417 --> 01:01:12,543
<b>This is the death certificate</b>

881
01:01:12,626 --> 01:01:14,628
<b>where the real cause
of Prince Imperial Geum's death</b>

882
01:01:15,379 --> 01:01:16,589
<b>is written.</b>

883
01:01:27,850 --> 01:01:29,518
<b>Lee Lim was killed</b>

884
01:01:30,478 --> 01:01:35,066
<b>not by the Royal Guards
but by the fracture of the cervical spine.</b>

885
01:01:35,733 --> 01:01:38,277
<b>He got his neck broken
and then was thrown into the ocean.</b>

886
01:01:39,278 --> 01:01:40,404
<b>How strange is that?</b>

887
01:01:42,531 --> 01:01:43,574
<b>What's even stranger was</b>

888
01:01:44,533 --> 01:01:48,788
<b>that Lee Lim was a man
with the body of a big warrior.</b>

889
01:01:49,372 --> 01:01:51,624
<b>But the corpse we found</b>

890
01:01:52,666 --> 01:01:57,463
<b>showed signs that it was born
with poliomyelitis.</b>

891
01:01:57,546 --> 01:01:59,382
<b>Not to mention its appearance,</b>

892
01:01:59,924 --> 01:02:06,097
<b>its fingerprints and even blood type
matched with Lee Lim.</b>

893
01:02:06,847 --> 01:02:08,516
<b>That odd corpse confused me,</b>

894
01:02:09,975 --> 01:02:11,644
<b>and that is why I hid it from you.</b>

895
01:02:16,941 --> 01:02:18,734
<b>You have been hiding it
for quite a long time.</b>

896
01:02:20,569 --> 01:02:22,071
<b>It's not a minor crime</b>

897
01:02:22,655 --> 01:02:24,365
<b>to lie about the death</b>

898
01:02:24,990 --> 01:02:26,325
<b>of a traitor of the nation</b>

899
01:02:29,328 --> 01:02:31,288
<b>and a high-profile criminal.</b>

900
01:02:32,081 --> 01:02:34,917
<b>I know that, Your Majesty.</b>

901
01:02:35,876 --> 01:02:36,752
<b>That's why</b>

902
01:02:38,212 --> 01:02:40,881
<b>I have been feeling guilty my entire life.</b>

903
01:02:42,133 --> 01:02:44,802
<b>I would like to free myself
from that guilt now.</b>

904
01:02:46,303 --> 01:02:50,433
<b>If you ever find out the truth
behind that odd incident,</b>

905
01:02:51,016 --> 01:02:53,561
<b>will you please tell me?</b>

906
01:02:55,813 --> 01:02:57,982
<b>What truth could lay behind that body?</b>

907
01:02:59,108 --> 01:03:00,818
<b>I have been curious about it
my whole life.</b>

908
01:03:02,194 --> 01:03:03,487
<b>Although I do not deserve it,</b>

909
01:03:04,405 --> 01:03:05,990
<b>I would like to know as a doctor.</b>

910
01:03:23,966 --> 01:03:25,718
<b>Yes! Popsicles!</b>

911
01:03:26,385 --> 01:03:27,344
<b>-Thank you.
-Eat it.</b>

912
01:03:27,428 --> 01:03:28,429
<b>Yes, sir.</b>

913
01:03:29,305 --> 01:03:30,890
<b>Yes! This one's my favorite.</b>

914
01:03:32,016 --> 01:03:33,517
<b>Leave it there. It's for someone else.</b>

915
01:03:33,684 --> 01:03:34,935
<b>Okay.</b>
