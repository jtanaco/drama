<b>(Episode 27)</b>

2
00:00:20,056 --> 00:00:21,056
<b>Ha Jin.</b>

3
00:00:29,297 --> 00:00:31,066
<b>Where have you been?</b>

4
00:00:31,836 --> 00:00:33,637
<b>I've been worried sick.</b>

5
00:00:34,266 --> 00:00:36,637
<b>At the least,
you should have told Ha Kyung.</b>

6
00:00:40,076 --> 00:00:41,477
<b>Anchor Lee,</b>

7
00:00:42,746 --> 00:00:44,146
<b>don't you hate me?</b>

8
00:00:52,487 --> 00:00:53,557
<b>Ha Jin.</b>

9
00:00:55,426 --> 00:00:58,097
<b>I'm the one who broke up with you,</b>

10
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:09,106
<b>but I missed you to death.</b>

11
00:01:10,876 --> 00:01:13,007
<b>I couldn't even breathe...</b>

12
00:01:14,906 --> 00:01:17,117
<b>to think I'll never see you again.</b>

13
00:01:22,986 --> 00:01:26,016
<b>May I just stay by your side?</b>

14
00:02:05,027 --> 00:02:07,897
<b>(Find Me in Your Memory)</b>

15
00:02:33,217 --> 00:02:34,687
<b>You should get changed into these.</b>

16
00:02:35,326 --> 00:02:37,257
<b>How long were you
sitting out in the rain?</b>

17
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:39,197
<b>What if you really catch a cold?</b>

18
00:02:39,896 --> 00:02:40,896
<b>Here.</b>

19
00:02:43,667 --> 00:02:44,766
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

20
00:02:45,497 --> 00:02:47,507
<b>I must've been out of my mind.</b>

21
00:02:50,276 --> 00:02:52,576
<b>I didn't mean what I just said.</b>

22
00:02:52,776 --> 00:02:54,407
<b>Please pretend like
you didn't hear it.</b>

23
00:02:54,546 --> 00:02:55,646
<b>Please excuse me.</b>

24
00:02:57,046 --> 00:02:58,917
<b>You said you wanted to
stay by my side.</b>

25
00:03:01,817 --> 00:03:03,657
<b>Are you sure you didn't mean that?</b>

26
00:03:14,967 --> 00:03:18,236
<b>No. I didn't mean it.</b>

27
00:03:21,336 --> 00:03:22,407
<b>All right.</b>

28
00:03:23,576 --> 00:03:24,806
<b>I understand.</b>

29
00:03:27,977 --> 00:03:29,477
<b>But do get changed...</b>

30
00:03:29,847 --> 00:03:32,046
<b>and grab a cup of hot tea
before you go.</b>

31
00:03:33,616 --> 00:03:35,247
<b>Then I'll pretend like
I didn't hear you.</b>

32
00:03:39,116 --> 00:03:41,486
<b>You broke all of our promises...</b>

33
00:03:42,227 --> 00:03:44,356
<b>and had me worried all day long.</b>

34
00:03:45,856 --> 00:03:47,567
<b>So you can do this much for me.</b>

35
00:03:57,977 --> 00:03:58,977
<b>Ha Jin.</b>

36
00:03:59,977 --> 00:04:01,907
<b>Come out
if you're done getting changed.</b>

37
00:04:18,826 --> 00:04:20,567
<b>I changed my mind too.</b>

38
00:04:23,297 --> 00:04:25,336
<b>I can't let you go
after a cup of tea,</b>

39
00:04:26,396 --> 00:04:27,567
<b>so eat this before you go.</b>

40
00:04:32,706 --> 00:04:33,947
<b>Take a seat. Come on.</b>

41
00:04:51,156 --> 00:04:53,357
<b>I'm not sure if it's any good
because I had to make it in a hurry.</b>

42
00:04:59,266 --> 00:05:00,266
<b>Here.</b>

43
00:05:00,937 --> 00:05:02,607
<b>Drink that
and take your time to eat.</b>

44
00:05:03,976 --> 00:05:05,336
<b>You should get changed.</b>

45
00:05:06,076 --> 00:05:08,247
<b>You might end up
catching a cold too.</b>

46
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:10,146
<b>I'm fine.</b>

47
00:05:10,447 --> 00:05:13,076
<b>You're making me feel uncomfortable.
You should go get changed.</b>

48
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:16,416
<b>No, I don't want to get changed.</b>

49
00:05:17,057 --> 00:05:18,057
<b>Why not?</b>

50
00:05:18,487 --> 00:05:21,187
<b>I'm afraid you might leave
while I get changed.</b>

51
00:05:22,057 --> 00:05:23,927
<b>You told me to finish this
before I go.</b>

52
00:05:23,927 --> 00:05:25,396
<b>Go get changed.</b>

53
00:05:31,836 --> 00:05:33,966
<b>You must be upset about your drama.</b>

54
00:05:33,966 --> 00:05:35,437
<b>You prepared so much for it.</b>

55
00:05:37,007 --> 00:05:38,007
<b>Yes.</b>

56
00:05:38,877 --> 00:05:41,547
<b>I'm sure you'll find
another great work soon. Cheer up.</b>

57
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:45,776
<b>Thank you.</b>

58
00:05:48,047 --> 00:05:50,716
<b>Take your time and eat.
I'll take you home when you're done.</b>

59
00:05:52,687 --> 00:05:54,656
<b>I'm fine. I can call Ha Kyung...</b>

60
00:05:54,656 --> 00:05:56,127
<b>or take a taxi.</b>

61
00:05:56,526 --> 00:05:59,127
<b>I already called her
and told her I'm with you.</b>

62
00:05:59,497 --> 00:06:01,127
<b>I thought she'd be worried.</b>

63
00:06:02,797 --> 00:06:04,567
<b>It's late and raining.</b>

64
00:06:05,737 --> 00:06:08,367
<b>If I let you go alone
after telling her that I'm with you,</b>

65
00:06:08,937 --> 00:06:12,206
<b>Ha Kyung will think
I'm completely irresponsible.</b>

66
00:06:13,036 --> 00:06:15,576
<b>That's why I have to take you home.</b>

67
00:06:28,226 --> 00:06:29,857
<b>Go home safely.</b>

68
00:06:30,656 --> 00:06:32,956
<b>I'll return your clothes
through Ha Kyung.</b>

69
00:06:34,867 --> 00:06:37,026
<b>I'm the one who's bad, not you.</b>

70
00:06:39,596 --> 00:06:41,007
<b>I knew everything,</b>

71
00:06:42,836 --> 00:06:45,536
<b>but I didn't want to lose you
and got selfish.</b>

72
00:06:48,646 --> 00:06:50,516
<b>I couldn't go on without you.</b>

73
00:06:55,047 --> 00:06:57,317
<b>So you don't have to try hard.</b>

74
00:06:59,387 --> 00:07:01,156
<b>I'll be the bad person.</b>

75
00:07:05,997 --> 00:07:08,997
<b>Ha Jin!
Do you know how much I was worried?</b>

76
00:07:09,797 --> 00:07:10,797
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

77
00:07:11,567 --> 00:07:13,637
<b>Goodbye, Anchor Lee.</b>

78
00:07:15,137 --> 00:07:16,237
<b>Let's go inside.</b>

79
00:07:43,627 --> 00:07:45,367
<b>I found this out front,
so I brought it in.</b>

80
00:07:45,367 --> 00:07:47,137
<b>I think you threw these out
by mistake.</b>

81
00:07:47,706 --> 00:07:49,437
<b>I threw away the scripts.</b>

82
00:07:49,766 --> 00:07:52,836
<b>But you can throw these away again
if you want to.</b>

83
00:08:19,067 --> 00:08:20,706
<b>(Anchor Lee)</b>

84
00:08:39,156 --> 00:08:40,656
<b>What is it?</b>

85
00:08:41,587 --> 00:08:42,987
<b>I came for my long sleeves.</b>

86
00:08:44,127 --> 00:08:45,196
<b>Your long sleeves?</b>

87
00:08:45,196 --> 00:08:48,327
<b>Yes. The one you wore last night.</b>

88
00:08:48,967 --> 00:08:50,666
<b>I have to wear it today.</b>

89
00:08:53,536 --> 00:08:56,367
<b>If today's not the best time,
I can come by tomorrow.</b>

90
00:08:58,906 --> 00:09:01,676
<b>No, that's okay. Hold on.</b>

91
00:09:11,156 --> 00:09:12,416
<b>Is it delivery?</b>

92
00:09:12,587 --> 00:09:13,987
<b>No, it's Anchor Lee.</b>

93
00:09:15,056 --> 00:09:17,727
<b>He's here? Why?</b>

94
00:09:18,026 --> 00:09:19,696
<b>He wants the clothes
I wore yesterday.</b>

95
00:09:22,066 --> 00:09:23,166
<b>What?</b>

96
00:09:25,896 --> 00:09:26,896
<b>Here you go.</b>

97
00:09:28,766 --> 00:09:32,237
<b>Thanks. I forgot
I had to wear it today.</b>

98
00:09:35,707 --> 00:09:36,847
<b>Did you sleep well?</b>

99
00:09:38,146 --> 00:09:39,146
<b>Yes.</b>

100
00:09:39,546 --> 00:09:40,546
<b>Did you have breakfast?</b>

101
00:09:41,446 --> 00:09:42,446
<b>Not yet.</b>

102
00:09:43,646 --> 00:09:45,487
<b>Don't skip your meals.</b>

103
00:09:46,117 --> 00:09:47,117
<b>Goodbye.</b>

104
00:10:01,007 --> 00:10:02,007
<b>Have some macarons.</b>

105
00:10:03,266 --> 00:10:05,737
<b>What's gotten into you?
You've never offered me sweets.</b>

106
00:10:05,977 --> 00:10:08,507
<b>It's still early in the morning.
You can have two.</b>

107
00:10:09,146 --> 00:10:11,816
<b>You feel sorry for me
since the drama fell through, right?</b>

108
00:10:11,816 --> 00:10:13,946
<b>Don't be ridiculous.</b>

109
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:15,487
<b>You're going to work
on something even better.</b>

110
00:10:15,487 --> 00:10:18,186
<b>I heard there's a pile of scripts
this high at the office.</b>

111
00:10:24,896 --> 00:10:26,097
<b>Are you going...</b>

112
00:10:27,666 --> 00:10:28,696
<b>to break up with him?</b>

113
00:10:29,597 --> 00:10:30,936
<b>I already did.</b>

114
00:10:31,137 --> 00:10:34,337
<b>I know that's not what you want.
I know you like him a lot.</b>

115
00:10:35,967 --> 00:10:38,477
<b>Didn't you dive into work
because you were in pain?</b>

116
00:10:40,007 --> 00:10:41,146
<b>I'm going to endure it.</b>

117
00:10:42,806 --> 00:10:43,847
<b>I have to.</b>

118
00:10:45,676 --> 00:10:47,487
<b>I can't be with him.</b>

119
00:10:48,247 --> 00:10:49,487
<b>I don't deserve him.</b>

120
00:10:56,227 --> 00:10:57,426
<b>Did you receive any tip-offs
on Moon Seong Ho?</b>

121
00:10:58,627 --> 00:11:00,997
<b>Yes, a few.</b>

122
00:11:00,997 --> 00:11:03,026
<b>But they turned out to be false.</b>

123
00:11:03,227 --> 00:11:04,467
<b>They mistook others for him.</b>

124
00:11:05,737 --> 00:11:07,097
<b>I thought this would be easy,</b>

125
00:11:07,097 --> 00:11:08,337
<b>but he's more tenacious
than I thought.</b>

126
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:10,306
<b>Let me know every time
you receive new calls.</b>

127
00:11:10,806 --> 00:11:12,077
<b>Okay. I'll do that.</b>

128
00:11:12,507 --> 00:11:13,906
<b>What is this shopping bag?</b>

129
00:11:15,946 --> 00:11:17,717
<b>It's just an excuse to see her face.</b>

130
00:11:17,977 --> 00:11:18,977
<b>What?</b>

131
00:11:30,186 --> 00:11:31,196
<b>Ha Kyung.</b>

132
00:11:31,597 --> 00:11:32,656
<b>Hello.</b>

133
00:11:33,296 --> 00:11:35,497
<b>I'm sorry for calling
out of the blue.</b>

134
00:11:35,597 --> 00:11:38,097
<b>It's fine. What is it?</b>

135
00:11:38,967 --> 00:11:40,936
<b>There's no one
more important to me...</b>

136
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:43,367
<b>than my sister.</b>

137
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:47,776
<b>But she's in a lot of pain
right now.</b>

138
00:11:49,507 --> 00:11:52,117
<b>She didn't break up with you
because she wanted to.</b>

139
00:11:52,676 --> 00:11:53,916
<b>It's all because of Seo Yeon.</b>

140
00:11:54,347 --> 00:11:56,016
<b>She feels guilty.</b>

141
00:11:56,286 --> 00:11:57,316
<b>I know.</b>

142
00:11:59,387 --> 00:12:01,227
<b>You're not going
to let her go, right?</b>

143
00:12:02,426 --> 00:12:04,056
<b>I can't.</b>

144
00:12:05,526 --> 00:12:07,497
<b>She's the most important person
to me as well.</b>

145
00:12:10,266 --> 00:12:12,837
<b>Seeing how you came
all the way here to tell me this,</b>

146
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:15,337
<b>I guess it's safe to say
that you're on my side.</b>

147
00:12:19,036 --> 00:12:22,107
<b>I'm glad to have an ally.</b>

148
00:12:30,987 --> 00:12:31,987
<b>Chul.</b>

149
00:12:32,257 --> 00:12:33,556
<b>Hello.</b>

150
00:12:33,957 --> 00:12:35,286
<b>Did you have lunch?</b>

151
00:12:36,156 --> 00:12:37,286
<b>Yes, I did.</b>

152
00:12:38,227 --> 00:12:39,296
<b>Let's go.</b>

153
00:12:43,627 --> 00:12:44,666
<b>Here you go.</b>

154
00:12:45,796 --> 00:12:47,296
<b>Why are there so many?</b>

155
00:12:47,566 --> 00:12:50,007
<b>These are only a few
that I picked out last night.</b>

156
00:12:50,007 --> 00:12:52,007
<b>Everyone has been sending in
their scripts...</b>

157
00:12:52,007 --> 00:12:53,977

<b>I heard it's really spicy.</b>

319

<b>I can just answer
your questions then.</b>

320
00:22:10,396 --> 00:22:13,067
<b>Sounds good. I can answer

321

<b>I'll go first.</b>

<b>Wait. Then, you liked me first.</b>

330

<b>That's not it. It was after that.</b>

331

<b>I don't think so.</b>

332

<b>I said no.</b>

<b>Yes. It's not a severe injury.</b>

<b>Did you find any leads?</b>

00:29:41,047 --> 00:29:42,047
<b>That little...</b>

465
00:29:53,786 --> 00:29:55,387
<b>What do you mean...</b>

466
00:29:55,387 --> 00:29:57,427
<b>we can't publish
Professor Yoo's book?</b>

467
00:29:57,756 --> 00:30:00,056
<b>I'm the current doctor
of that patient.</b>

468
00:30:00,497 --> 00:30:03,667
<b>I found my medical records
cited in that book.</b>

469
00:30:04,296 --> 00:30:07,067
<b>You do know that you'll be liable...</b>

470
00:30:07,267 --> 00:30:10,236
<b>for illegal leakage or citation
of medical records, don't you?</b>

471
00:30:10,466 --> 00:30:11,477
<b>Pardon?</b>

472
00:30:11,806 --> 00:30:14,707
<b>I never provided my medical records,</b>

473
00:30:14,747 --> 00:30:16,646
<b>and I do not plan on doing so.</b>

474
00:30:17,207 --> 00:30:18,747
<b>If you decide to push ahead
with the publication,</b>

475
00:30:18,747 --> 00:30:20,346
<b>I will take the legal measure
right away.</b>

476
00:30:20,346 --> 00:30:21,346
<b>Wait,</b>

477
00:30:21,686 --> 00:30:23,816
<b>of all people,
this is your father's book.</b>

478
00:30:23,816 --> 00:30:24,816
<b>No.</b>

479
00:30:25,316 --> 00:30:27,486
<b>He may be my father,
but nothing will change.</b>

480
00:30:29,757 --> 00:30:31,626
<b>I'll assume that you have understood
what I said.</b>

481
00:30:31,626 --> 00:30:32,856
<b>Please excuse me.</b>

482
00:30:40,797 --> 00:30:42,967
<b>Is that what Tae Eun said?</b>

483
00:30:46,176 --> 00:30:47,577
<b>All right.</b>

484
00:31:08,966 --> 00:31:11,737
<b>Goodnight. Sweet dreams.</b>

485
00:31:15,966 --> 00:31:17,266
<b>You too.</b>

486
00:31:30,487 --> 00:31:33,087
<b>Hey, it's me.</b>

487
00:31:34,526 --> 00:31:36,287
<b>You don't go to work today, right?</b>

488
00:31:38,757 --> 00:31:40,127
<b>What's this chair?</b>

489
00:31:40,127 --> 00:31:41,627
<b>Did you make it?</b>

490
00:31:41,627 --> 00:31:42,627
<b>Yes.</b>

491
00:31:43,627 --> 00:31:44,766
<b>It's a present.</b>

492
00:31:45,537 --> 00:31:47,296
<b>Why did you
suddenly bring a present?</b>

493
00:31:48,537 --> 00:31:49,636
<b>Thank you.</b>

494
00:31:49,806 --> 00:31:50,806
<b>Sure.</b>

495
00:31:51,106 --> 00:31:52,436
<b>Have you had lunch?</b>

496
00:31:52,436 --> 00:31:54,076
<b>If you haven't,
you should stay for a meal.</b>

497
00:31:54,776 --> 00:31:56,177
<b>I'll have a glass of water.</b>

498
00:31:56,406 --> 00:31:57,406
<b>Sure.</b>

499
00:32:09,157 --> 00:32:10,157
<b>Here.</b>

500
00:32:17,296 --> 00:32:18,937
<b>Is everything all right?</b>

501
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:20,037
<b>Jeong Hoon.</b>

502
00:32:20,697 --> 00:32:23,537
<b>I remember how I locked you up
in that closet as a child.</b>

503
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:25,576
<b>I am sorry...</b>

504
00:32:26,537 --> 00:32:28,106
<b>for what I did back then.</b>

505
00:32:29,076 --> 00:32:32,477
<b>I know I hurt you deeply,
and that you'll never forget.</b>

506
00:32:35,916 --> 00:32:37,447
<b>I'm truly sorry.</b>

507
00:32:45,697 --> 00:32:47,197
<b>You should get back to work.</b>

508
00:32:49,426 --> 00:32:50,467
<b>Father.</b>

509
00:32:56,266 --> 00:32:58,676
<b>I love this chair.</b>

510
00:32:59,877 --> 00:33:00,937
<b>Thank you.</b>

511
00:33:02,877 --> 00:33:04,576
<b>From now on,</b>

512
00:33:05,416 --> 00:33:07,477
<b>this chair will be my memory of you.</b>

513
00:33:10,916 --> 00:33:14,187
<b>I'm going to try
to let go of my past from now on.</b>

514
00:33:34,037 --> 00:33:35,106
<b>Moon Seong Ho?</b>

515
00:33:35,907 --> 00:33:38,076
<b>You must've been
dying to hear from me.</b>

516
00:33:38,646 --> 00:33:39,646
<b>Where are you?</b>

517
00:33:39,646 --> 00:33:41,546
<b>That's not it.</b>

518
00:33:42,086 --> 00:33:43,146
<b>You shouldn't ask for my location.</b>

519
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:45,586
<b>You need to ask me
what I'm about to do.</b>

520
00:33:45,586 --> 00:33:46,986
<b>That's the essence.</b>

521
00:33:48,586 --> 00:33:50,027
<b>What do you want?</b>

522
00:33:50,326 --> 00:33:51,597
<b>Yes, I like that question.</b>

523
00:33:52,826 --> 00:33:54,766
<b>What do I want?</b>

524
00:33:56,326 --> 00:33:58,736
<b>My eternal love with Seo Yeon.</b>

525
00:33:59,796 --> 00:34:01,407
<b>I'll prove it to you.</b>

526
00:34:11,076 --> 00:34:14,547
<b>The number you reached
cannot take any calls.</b>

527
00:34:18,656 --> 00:34:20,617
<b>Yes, Detective.
This is Lee Jeong Hoon.</b>

528
00:34:21,456 --> 00:34:23,627
<b>I just received a call
from Moon Seong Ho.</b>

529
00:34:23,956 --> 00:34:26,257
<b>It seemed like a payphone.
Can you find the location?</b>

530
00:35:00,326 --> 00:35:03,167
<b>(The late Jung Seo Yeon)</b>

531
00:35:11,206 --> 00:35:13,007
<b>I'm too late, aren't I?</b>

532
00:35:14,377 --> 00:35:15,776
<b>I'm sorry for leaving you alone.</b>

533
00:35:29,927 --> 00:35:31,456
<b>(The late Jung Seo Yeon)</b>

534
00:35:57,716 --> 00:35:58,716
<b>Yes, Detective.</b>

535
00:35:58,716 --> 00:36:00,716
<b>I found the location
of Moon's cell phone.</b>

536
00:36:01,526 --> 00:36:02,586
<b>Where is it?</b>

537
00:36:02,586 --> 00:36:04,896
<b>It's near Inho-dong in Paju.
Does that ring a bell?</b>

538
00:36:37,757 --> 00:36:38,857
<b>Did you do this?</b>

539
00:36:40,757 --> 00:36:42,797
<b>You came faster than I had expected.</b>

540
00:36:43,466 --> 00:36:47,266
<b>You're really good
at catching onto my hints.</b>

541
00:36:48,507 --> 00:36:49,567
<b>If I was a second too late,</b>

542
00:36:49,867 --> 00:36:51,906
<b>I may have not been able
to bring Seo Yeon with me.</b>

543
00:36:51,937 --> 00:36:52,976
<b>Don't you think so?</b>

544
00:36:54,206 --> 00:36:55,607
<b>Why are you doing this?</b>

545
00:36:56,607 --> 00:36:58,747
<b>Am I not the one
you want to get rid of?</b>

546
00:36:59,846 --> 00:37:02,317
<b>Yes. You're right.</b>

547
00:37:03,947 --> 00:37:06,216
<b>I'll come to you. Tell me where.</b>

548
00:37:06,987 --> 00:37:08,726
<b>I can go right away.</b>

549
00:37:09,726 --> 00:37:11,427
<b>Are you worried?</b>

550
00:37:11,427 --> 00:37:14,456
<b>Do you think I might harm
Yeo Ha Jin?</b>

551
00:37:16,297 --> 00:37:17,797
<b>Shut it and tell me where you are.</b>

552
00:37:17,797 --> 00:37:18,836
<b>Mr. Lee.</b>

553
00:37:21,966 --> 00:37:23,507
<b>Be quiet and wait.</b>

554
00:37:24,437 --> 00:37:25,576
<b>I'll call you again.</b>

555
00:37:36,547 --> 00:37:39,716
<b>Ha Kyung, are you with Ha Jin?</b>

556
00:37:39,917 --> 00:37:41,317
<b>Yes, we're
at the broadcasting station.</b>

557
00:37:41,317 --> 00:37:42,956
<b>She has a meeting regarding a drama.</b>

558
00:37:44,687 --> 00:37:46,427
<b>You're at the broadcasting station?</b>

559
00:37:47,326 --> 00:37:50,067
<b>You had to go through security
to get to the office, right?</b>

560
00:37:50,667 --> 00:37:51,966
<b>You're right.</b>

561
00:37:53,067 --> 00:37:55,206
<b>Can you wait there
after the meeting ends?</b>

562
00:37:55,867 --> 00:37:57,766
<b>I have something to say to her.</b>

563
00:37:58,377 --> 00:38:00,836
<b>I thought you're not working today
since it's the weekend.</b>

564
00:38:01,406 --> 00:38:03,206
<b>No, I'm just about to leave.</b>

565
00:38:04,047 --> 00:38:06,747
<b>Don't go outside the building.
Make sure to stay inside.</b>

566
00:38:06,976 --> 00:38:08,487
<b>I'll call you when I'm almost there.</b>

567
00:38:09,146 --> 00:38:10,247
<b>Okay.</b>

568
00:38:10,247 --> 00:38:11,656
<b>Thank you.</b>

569
00:39:11,106 --> 00:39:12,317
<b>Wait a little bit more.</b>

570
00:39:14,986 --> 00:39:16,317
<b>We're almost there.</b>

571
00:40:09,767 --> 00:40:12,836
<b>This was the last location
of his phone.</b>

572
00:40:12,907 --> 00:40:14,437
<b>I'll look for him as well.</b>

573
00:40:14,437 --> 00:40:15,947
<b>It's dangerous.
You should wait here.</b>

574
00:40:15,947 --> 00:40:18,246
<b>He even stole her ashes
in order to lure me.</b>

575
00:40:19,777 --> 00:40:21,787
<b>If I don't show up,
he'll hide once again.</b>

576
00:40:22,846 --> 00:40:24,116
<b>No, it's too dangerous.</b>

577
00:40:24,716 --> 00:40:26,017
<b>All right, let's look for him.</b>

578
00:40:26,017 --> 00:40:27,116
<b>Let's go.</b>

579
00:40:27,317 --> 00:40:28,956
<b>- Which channel are you on?
- Channel one, sir.</b>

580
00:40:28,956 --> 00:40:30,326
<b>One? Okay.</b>

581
00:40:31,057 --> 00:40:32,456
<b>- Hurry up.
- Yes, sir.</b>

582
00:40:32,456 --> 00:40:34,297
<b>- All right.
- Where could he be?</b>

583
00:40:35,596 --> 00:40:37,267
<b>Check that side.</b>

584
00:40:38,466 --> 00:40:40,637
<b>- I'll check this area and go up.
- Okay.</b>

585
00:40:42,206 --> 00:40:44,437
<b>I told you to wait for my call,
but you came here first.</b>

586
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:47,576
<b>You even brought some guests.</b>

587
00:41:01,726 --> 00:41:03,756
<b>Sir, he's on the rooftop.</b>

588
00:41:12,596 --> 00:41:14,137
<b>Watch carefully.</b>

589
00:41:16,437 --> 00:41:18,236
<b>It's almost over.</b>

590
00:41:51,567 --> 00:41:52,907
<b>It's been a long time.</b>

591
00:41:55,376 --> 00:41:57,706
<b>What do you think about this place?
It seems familiar, right?</b>

592
00:41:58,547 --> 00:42:02,917
<b>I couldn't think of a better place
than here to carry out my last task.</b>

593
00:42:04,317 --> 00:42:07,817
<b>This is where Seo Yeon and I
will begin our love.</b>

594
00:42:09,057 --> 00:42:10,356
<b>It was this place all along?</b>

595
00:42:15,226 --> 00:42:16,326
<b>Is it locked?</b>

596
00:42:16,626 --> 00:42:17,726
<b>Mr. Lee!</b>

597
00:42:18,267 --> 00:42:19,996
<b>- Open up!
- Oh, no.</b>

598
00:42:19,996 --> 00:42:21,537
<b>We should end this quickly.</b>

599
00:42:22,267 --> 00:42:23,937
<b>- Mr. Lee!
- I want to see Seo Yeon...</b>

600
00:42:23,937 --> 00:42:25,637
<b>as soon as possible.</b>

601
00:42:26,376 --> 00:42:27,637
<b>You're insane.</b>

602
00:42:27,637 --> 00:42:29,907
<b>- Hey, hey!
- Don't forget.</b>

603
00:42:30,147 --> 00:42:32,177
<b>The one who'll be by her side...</b>

604
00:42:33,017 --> 00:42:35,147
<b>is me, not you!</b>

605
00:42:37,947 --> 00:42:38,956
<b>Mr. Lee!</b>

606
00:42:40,856 --> 00:42:42,826
<b>Moon Seong Ho! Stop right there!</b>

607
00:42:44,256 --> 00:42:45,897
<b>- Stop!
- Stop it!</b>

608
00:42:45,897 --> 00:42:47,397
<b>- Drop your knife!
- Put it down!</b>

609
00:42:47,397 --> 00:42:49,427
<b>- Don't come near.
- Drop that knife.</b>

610
00:42:49,427 --> 00:42:50,466
<b>Don't come near me.</b>

611
00:42:50,567 --> 00:42:52,236
<b>Calm down. Seong Ho.</b>

612
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:53,267
<b>Don't come near.</b>

<b>I won. I did.</b>

618
00:43:13,687 --> 00:43:14,716
<b>Seo Yeon.</b>

619
00:43:16,387 --> 00:43:17,626
<b>I'm on my way.</b>

620
00:43:55,866 --> 00:43:58,836
<b>He wanted me to wait
because he had something to say?</b>

621
00:43:59,996 --> 00:44:01,067
<b>Yes.</b>

622
00:44:02,236 --> 00:44:05,236
<b>Maybe he's driving.
He's not replying back.</b>

623
00:44:09,206 --> 00:44:11,277
<b>You guys aren't up to anything,
are you?</b>

624
00:44:11,846 --> 00:44:14,677
<b>Don't be ridiculous. Gosh.</b>

625
00:44:18,917 --> 00:44:21,116
<b>You know what?
Let's be honest with each other.</b>

626
00:44:21,116 --> 00:44:22,927
<b>I want you guys
to get back together.</b>

627
00:44:23,787 --> 00:44:25,297
<b>When you're with him,</b>

628
00:44:25,297 --> 00:44:26,996
<b>you seem at peace
like you did in the past.</b>

629
00:44:27,297 --> 00:44:29,226
<b>I know you don't want to break up.</b>

630
00:44:29,466 --> 00:44:31,096
<b>Aren't you happy with him?</b>

631
00:44:31,596 --> 00:44:33,037
<b>How many times
do I need to tell you?</b>

632
00:44:33,736 --> 00:44:35,866
<b>I can't be selfish about this.</b>

633
00:44:36,437 --> 00:44:38,677
<b>Do you really think this is
the best solution for you guys?</b>

634
00:44:39,576 --> 00:44:42,807
<b>Focus on what's most important
to you right now.</b>

635
00:44:42,807 --> 00:44:44,147
<b>I think that's
the right thing to do.</b>

636
00:44:45,417 --> 00:44:47,716
<b>But then again, I know I am
the most important person to you.</b>

637
00:44:52,017 --> 00:44:53,787
<b>Oh, it's Anchor Lee.</b>

638
00:45:01,256 --> 00:45:02,527
<b>I'll pick it up.</b>

639
00:45:07,537 --> 00:45:08,606
<b>Hello?</b>

640
00:45:24,317 --> 00:45:26,657
<b>(Restricted Area, Operation Room)</b>

641
00:45:27,317 --> 00:45:28,726
<b>I was the one who called.</b>

642
00:45:29,226 --> 00:45:30,756
<b>What happened?</b>

643
00:45:30,927 --> 00:45:34,226
<b>You know Moon Seong Ho, the inmate
who escaped the hospital, right?</b>

644
00:45:34,256 --> 00:45:35,397
<b>Mr. Lee was trying to catch him.</b>

645
00:45:36,366 --> 00:45:37,927
<b>Is he in a critical situation?</b>

646
00:45:38,167 --> 00:45:39,797
<b>They'll only know
once the surgery is over.</b>

647
00:45:40,096 --> 00:45:41,637
<b>You should wait for now.</b>

648
00:46:01,486 --> 00:46:03,787
<b>How did it go? How is he?</b>

649
00:46:04,086 --> 00:46:06,256
<b>It went well.</b>

650
00:46:07,626 --> 00:46:08,826
<b>Thank you.</b>

651
00:46:08,826 --> 00:46:09,996
<b>He was bleeding a lot.</b>

652
00:46:10,297 --> 00:46:11,897
<b>But thankfully,
the wound wasn't deep,</b>

653
00:46:11,897 --> 00:46:14,496
<b>and his organs weren't damaged.</b>

654
00:46:14,496 --> 00:46:16,067
<b>He'll be okay.</b>

655
00:46:16,366 --> 00:46:18,307
<b>Then is everything all right?</b>

656
00:46:18,307 --> 00:46:20,777
<b>Yes. He'll wake up
once the anesthesia wears off.</b>

657
00:46:20,777 --> 00:46:22,547
<b>Don't worry. Goodbye.</b>

658
00:46:22,547 --> 00:46:23,647
<b>Thank you.</b>

659
00:46:23,647 --> 00:46:24,907
<b>- Thank you.
- No problem.</b>

660
00:46:26,376 --> 00:46:27,517
<b>That's a relief.</b>

661
00:46:50,706 --> 00:46:52,836
<b>Are you awake? Can you see me?</b>

662
00:46:55,907 --> 00:46:57,677
<b>Am I dreaming right now?</b>

663
00:46:59,046 --> 00:47:02,617
<b>You're with me and holding my hand.</b>

664
00:47:03,316 --> 00:47:05,816
<b>How can you make a joke now?
You gave me a scare.</b>

665
00:47:07,256 --> 00:47:10,026
<b>I guess I'm not dreaming
since you look really angry.</b>

666
00:47:11,986 --> 00:47:13,327
<b>I wasn't angry.</b>

667
00:47:14,597 --> 00:47:16,667
<b>I raised my voice
because I was happy.</b>

668
00:47:17,996 --> 00:47:19,597
<b>I'm sorry for scaring you...</b>

669
00:47:20,566 --> 00:47:22,506
<b>and making you wait.</b>

670
00:47:23,437 --> 00:47:25,306
<b>You said you'd be the bad guy.</b>

671
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:30,447
<b>Bad guys don't apologize this often.</b>

672
00:47:34,117 --> 00:47:36,847
<b>Wait. I'll get your doctor.</b>

673
00:47:42,456 --> 00:47:44,857
<b>I don't want you to go anywhere.</b>

674
00:47:46,327 --> 00:47:48,226
<b>I won't leave you here.</b>

675
00:47:50,097 --> 00:47:52,066
<b>I should let them know

<b>I need you the most right now.</b>

677

<b>Can you bring
some comfortable clothes for me?</b>

678
00:48:20,127 --> 00:48:21,597
<b>Will you stay with him all night?</b>

679
00:48:21,697 --> 00:48:24,226
<b>Yes. I think
I need to stay with him.</b>

680
00:48:24,526 --> 00:48:26,766
<b>I can't just leave him alone
when he's sick.</b>

681
00:48:29,966 --> 00:48:31,867
<b>Come on. Just get me my clothes.</b>

682
00:48:32,407 --> 00:48:33,407
<b>Okay.</b>

683
00:48:41,947 --> 00:48:44,117
<b>(Intensive Care Unit)</b>

684
00:48:50,226 --> 00:48:51,486
<b>When he fell,</b>

685
00:48:51,486 --> 00:48:53,427
<b>his fifth cervical vertebra
was fractured...</b>

686
00:48:53,427 --> 00:48:55,157
<b>and pressed on his central nerves.</b>

687
00:48:55,897 --> 00:48:58,897
<b>Due to the nerve damage,
he's paralyzed from the neck down.</b>

688
00:48:59,337 --> 00:49:00,736
<b>Due to the brain hemorrhage,</b>

689
00:49:01,167 --> 00:49:03,306
<b>it's likely that he'll face
a speech impediment.</b>

690

<b>We were able to save his life,</b>

691
00:49:06,006 --> 00:49:09,476
<b>but there's nothing
he can do by himself.</b>

692
00:49:10,107 --> 00:49:12,847
<b>You can't even run away on your own.</b>

693

<b>Before you pay
for all of your crimes,</b>

694
00:49:17,617 --> 00:49:19,117
<b>don't even think about dying.</b>

695
00:49:42,947 --> 00:49:45,177
<b>You scared me when
you disappeared without telling me.</b>

696
00:49:47,246 --> 00:49:49,117
<b>It's cold.
What are you doing up here?</b>

697
00:49:50,647 --> 00:49:52,357
<b>I was just getting some air.</b>

698
00:49:53,056 --> 00:49:54,516
<b>It was stuffy inside.</b>

699
00:49:54,516 --> 00:49:56,756
<b>Even so, you must stay indoors.</b>

700
00:49:56,756 --> 00:49:57,927
<b>Let's go.</b>

701
00:50:11,566 --> 00:50:12,877
<b>Why are you staring at me like that?</b>

702
00:50:14,276 --> 00:50:16,006
<b>Can you just accept it now?</b>

703
00:50:18,077 --> 00:50:20,316
<b>You won't be able to bend my will.</b>

704
00:50:21,546 --> 00:50:23,117
<b>Let's talk inside.</b>

705
00:50:23,687 --> 00:50:25,816
<b>It's cold out here.
You can't catch a cold.</b>

706
00:50:26,716 --> 00:50:28,117
<b>I'll go once you answer me.</b>

707
00:50:39,197 --> 00:50:41,097
<b>I don't think I can do it yet.</b>

708
00:50:44,806 --> 00:50:48,306
<b>But when I thought I might not
be able to see you again,</b>

709
00:50:51,447 --> 00:50:53,177
<b>I was more scared of making...</b>

710
00:50:54,077 --> 00:50:56,216
<b>the same mistake
and suffering from it...</b>

711

<b>for the rest of my life.</b>

712
00:51:01,387 --> 00:51:03,657
<b>This must have been harder on you.</b>

713
00:51:06,357 --> 00:51:08,256
<b>But you still mustered up
the courage for me.</b>

714
00:51:18,367 --> 00:51:19,706
<b>You win.</b>

715
00:52:11,726 --> 00:52:13,857
<b>Stop walking around.
You should go to sleep now.</b>

716

<b>Get home safely, Ha Jin.</b>

717

<b>I'm not leaving.</b>

718
00:52:19,137 --> 00:52:21,266
<b>If I leave,
you'll walk around again.</b>

719
00:52:21,266 --> 00:52:23,206
<b>I'll be watching you
the whole night.</b>

720
00:52:23,407 --> 00:52:25,107
<b>I'll stay in the room. Don't worry.</b>

721
00:52:25,107 --> 00:52:26,677
<b>Go home now. It's late.</b>

722
00:52:26,677 --> 00:52:28,907
<b>No. I can't because
it makes me anxious.</b>

723
00:52:29,677 --> 00:52:31,476
<b>There's no place to stay.
It's uncomfortable for you.</b>

724
00:52:31,476 --> 00:52:33,917
<b>The doctor said you needed to rest
to recover. Lie down.</b>

725
00:52:34,216 --> 00:52:35,216
<b>Now.</b>

726
00:52:47,996 --> 00:52:50,996
<b>I don't think I can sleep when
you're staring at me like that.</b>

727
00:52:54,796 --> 00:52:58,236
<b>I'll go to sleep
if you answer my question.</b>

728
00:52:58,607 --> 00:53:00,177
<b>Okay. I'll answer it.</b>

729
00:53:00,177 --> 00:53:01,236
<b>What is it?</b>

730
00:53:03,577 --> 00:53:05,206
<b>Did you miss me?</b>

731
00:53:09,016 --> 00:53:10,986
<b>I missed you like crazy.</b>

732
00:53:13,917 --> 00:53:15,827
<b>I'll pass. Next question.</b>

733
00:53:22,026 --> 00:53:23,627
<b>The text messages I sent...</b>

734
00:53:26,597 --> 00:53:27,796
<b>Did you read them
before ignoring them...</b>

735
00:53:27,796 --> 00:53:29,236
<b>or did you not read them at all?</b>

736
00:53:32,607 --> 00:53:33,976
<b>Well, that's...</b>

737
00:53:36,046 --> 00:53:38,647
<b>Just go to sleep. If you keep
talking, you won't get sleepy.</b>

738
00:53:38,877 --> 00:53:39,976
<b>Close your eyes.</b>

739
00:53:45,516 --> 00:53:47,756
<b>Go to sleep now.
I'm serious. Sleep now.</b>

740
00:53:47,756 --> 00:53:48,816
<b>Okay.</b>

741
00:53:50,387 --> 00:53:52,357
<b>I think I'm getting sleepy...</b>

742
00:53:52,827 --> 00:53:54,657
<b>because you're covering my eyes.</b>

743
00:53:56,566 --> 00:53:57,566
<b>Right?</b>

744
00:53:59,697 --> 00:54:00,837
<b>Goodnight.</b>

745
00:54:16,087 --> 00:54:18,216
<b>The defendant was instigated

746

<b>Yeo Ha Jin's stalker,</b>

747
00:54:19,716 --> 00:54:21,917
<b>to stalk the actress...</b>

748
00:54:21,917 --> 00:54:23,456
<b>and to secretly take photos.</b>

749
00:54:23,456 --> 00:54:24,827
<b>He used his position
as a reporter...</b>

750
00:54:24,827 --> 00:54:27,056
<b>and ended up blackmailing
the actress.</b>

751
00:54:27,056 --> 00:54:28,526
<b>But I will accept his argument...</b>

752
00:54:28,526 --> 00:54:30,066
<b>that he wasn't aware his photos
could be used...</b>

753
00:54:30,066 --> 00:54:31,566
<b>in criminal activities,</b>

754
00:54:31,566 --> 00:54:32,667
<b>I sentence the defendant...</b>

755
00:54:32,667 --> 00:54:35,466
<b>2 years in prison
or 3 years on probation.</b>

756

<b>Hey, it's me. Mr. Hwang.</b>

757
00:54:39,377 --> 00:54:42,706
<b>I just wanted to thank you

<b>I need to buy you a drink.</b>

759

<b>When are you free?</b>

760
00:54:49,617 --> 00:54:50,917
<b>Here you go.</b>

761
00:54:51,087 --> 00:54:52,147
<b>That looks good.</b>

762
00:54:53,117 --> 00:54:55,857
<b>I was so shocked when
I heard Jeong Hoon got stabbed.</b>

<b>My heart is still beating

764

<b>I'm relieved that

<b>And he's recovering quickly too.</b>

766
00:55:01,226 --> 00:55:03,766
<b>Right. And Ha Jin is with him too.</b>

767
00:55:04,566 --> 00:55:06,036
<b>Things will work out

768
00:55:06,236 --> 00:55:07,296
<b>Right?</b>

769
00:55:08,236 --> 00:55:11,907
<b>I want my sister to just think

770
00:55:12,837 --> 00:55:14,137
<b>You did well.</b>

771
00:55:14,677 --> 00:55:15,806
<b>I didn't do much.</b>

772
00:55:16,147 --> 00:55:17,607
<b>- Let's eat.
- Okay.</b>

773
00:55:18,147 --> 00:55:19,147
<b>Here.</b>

774
00:55:21,746 --> 00:55:25,387
<b>By the way, we played
a game a few days ago.</b>

775
00:55:25,387 --> 00:55:27,556
<b>- Eating the spicy ramyeon.
- Yes. What about it?</b>

776
00:55:27,556 --> 00:55:29,427
<b>I want you to answer
the question you didn't answer.</b>

777
00:55:29,427 --> 00:55:31,657
<b>Did you date a lot of men?
Or did you just date a few?</b>

778
00:55:33,256 --> 00:55:34,996
<b>Are you that curious about that?</b>

779
00:55:34,996 --> 00:55:35,996
<b>Yes.</b>

780
00:55:36,827 --> 00:55:38,667
<b>I'll tell you
if you tell me your answer.</b>

781
00:55:38,667 --> 00:55:40,766
<b>Fine. Let's say it at the same time.</b>

782
00:55:40,766 --> 00:55:41,766
<b>Sure.</b>

783
00:55:42,566 --> 00:55:44,236
<b>In 1, 2, 3.</b>

784
00:55:44,236 --> 00:55:45,236
<b>- A lot.
- Not a lot...</b>

785
00:55:45,566 --> 00:55:47,206
<b>- You didn't date a lot?
- A lot of women?</b>

786
00:55:47,907 --> 00:55:49,476
<b>How many women did you date?</b>

787
00:55:49,476 --> 00:55:51,607
<b>About 4 or 5?</b>

788
00:55:51,607 --> 00:55:53,347
<b>What do you mean by that?</b>

789
00:55:53,347 --> 00:55:55,316
<b>I bet it's over 5. Is it over 10?</b>

790
00:55:55,316 --> 00:55:56,746
<b>No. I'm serious.</b>

791
00:55:57,087 --> 00:55:58,617
<b>How many men did you date then?</b>

792
00:56:00,087 --> 00:56:01,617
<b>I didn't date a lot of men.</b>

793
00:56:01,617 --> 00:56:03,956
<b>What is it? How many is it?</b>

794
00:56:03,956 --> 00:56:05,387
<b>I can't be your first.</b>

795
00:56:05,387 --> 00:56:06,796
<b>It's okay. Just tell me.</b>

796
00:56:09,427 --> 00:56:11,827
<b>Wait. Am I really
your first boyfriend?</b>

797
00:56:12,026 --> 00:56:13,137
<b>No!</b>

798
00:56:13,966 --> 00:56:15,236
<b>As if!</b>

799
00:56:15,367 --> 00:56:16,806
<b>Let's stop talking about this.</b>

800
00:56:17,167 --> 00:56:19,976
<b>My gosh, you're so cute!</b>

801
00:56:20,206 --> 00:56:23,107
<b>Fine, yes. It's in the past.
Let's move on.</b>

802
00:56:23,276 --> 00:56:25,077
<b>What's important is
our present, isn't it?</b>

803
00:56:25,806 --> 00:56:27,816
<b>Why? Are you sulking?</b>

804
00:56:28,617 --> 00:56:29,746
<b>It's more than 10, isn't it?</b>

805
00:56:30,617 --> 00:56:34,357
<b>No way. Come here.
Open your mouth. Here.</b>

806
00:56:35,056 --> 00:56:36,786
<b>Gosh, you're eating so well.</b>

807
00:56:52,466 --> 00:56:53,907
<b>Are you sure you can do this?</b>

808
00:56:54,107 --> 00:56:55,437
<b>Don't you trust me?</b>

809
00:56:55,706 --> 00:56:58,177
<b>I'll do just as you told me earlier.</b>

810
00:56:58,177 --> 00:57:00,377
<b>Yes, that's true,
but it's pretty tough...</b>

811
00:57:00,377 --> 00:57:01,546
<b>Quiet.</b>

812
00:57:05,887 --> 00:57:07,587
<b>- I'll do it.
- One second.</b>

813
00:57:08,286 --> 00:57:09,887
<b>Why? Mouth.</b>

814
00:57:27,706 --> 00:57:29,407
<b>I think I have a knack for this.</b>

815
00:57:36,246 --> 00:57:39,556
<b>Are you busy, Director Choi?
How does some Americano sound?</b>

816
00:57:40,187 --> 00:57:41,357
<b>Sounds great.</b>

817
00:57:43,256 --> 00:57:47,397
<b>Why do they make you work so hard
that you can't even go for lunch?</b>

818
00:57:48,496 --> 00:57:50,627
<b>I'm almost finished.</b>

819
00:57:52,667 --> 00:57:54,367
<b>I was just getting thirsty.</b>

820
00:57:55,437 --> 00:57:58,337
<b>- Thanks.
- I knew you'd be thirsty.</b>

821
00:57:58,337 --> 00:57:59,776
<b>My gosh.</b>

822
00:58:03,377 --> 00:58:04,647
<b>Gosh, this is great.</b>

823
00:58:05,776 --> 00:58:07,016
<b>What's this?</b>

824
00:58:07,016 --> 00:58:08,516
<b>This? It's a book.</b>

825
00:58:09,246 --> 00:58:11,147
<b>It seemed
very uncanny and interesting.</b>

826
00:58:11,486 --> 00:58:12,786
<b>You read books?</b>

827
00:58:13,256 --> 00:58:16,756
<b>What are you talking about?
I was once called a bookworm.</b>

828
00:58:17,157 --> 00:58:19,756
<b>I've known you for about 30 years,</b>

829
00:58:19,756 --> 00:58:21,127
<b>but this is unheard of.</b>

830
00:58:21,526 --> 00:58:22,556
<b>Goodness.</b>

831
00:58:23,627 --> 00:58:24,726
<b>What's it about?</b>

832
00:58:25,097 --> 00:58:26,996
<b>- Honey.
- What?</b>

833
00:58:26,996 --> 00:58:29,506
<b>Do you know
what hyperthymesia is?</b>

834
00:58:31,837 --> 00:58:34,206
<b>- What?
- It's someone who remembers...</b>

835
00:58:34,206 --> 00:58:36,907
<b>everything about their life,
all 365 days in a year.</b>

836
00:58:37,177 --> 00:58:39,347
<b>There's someone
who has that condition in Korea.</b>

837
00:58:39,746 --> 00:58:41,016
<b>Really?</b>

838
00:58:41,016 --> 00:58:44,187
<b>Yes. This book is about that person.</b>

839
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:46,056
<b>Don't you think it'll be uncanny
to meet them in real life?</b>

840
00:58:46,887 --> 00:58:49,056
<b>What's so uncanny about that?</b>

841
00:58:49,187 --> 00:58:51,786
<b>I'm sure it's someone
who just remembers well.</b>

842
00:58:52,026 --> 00:58:53,897
<b>This person is apparently an anchor,</b>

843
00:58:53,897 --> 00:58:55,756
<b>and he seems
very similar to Jeong Hoon.</b>

844
00:58:55,927 --> 00:58:57,526
<b>He has a great memory too.</b>

845
00:58:57,526 --> 00:59:01,367
<b>Does Jeong Hoon look like
someone with this disease?</b>

846
00:59:01,897 --> 00:59:04,766
<b>Yes, well,
I know he's good at his job,</b>

847
00:59:04,937 --> 00:59:08,536
<b>but he's way too normal and rude
to have a condition like this.</b>

848
00:59:08,536 --> 00:59:11,147
<b>So who could it be?
Is it someone at our station?</b>

849
00:59:11,147 --> 00:59:14,216
<b>I'm so curious. I'm dying to know.
It's driving me crazy.</b>

850
00:59:14,216 --> 00:59:16,046
<b>Why are you curious about that?</b>

851
00:59:16,046 --> 00:59:19,187
<b>Stop asking a useless question
and get ready for the news.</b>

852
00:59:19,187 --> 00:59:22,117
<b>Our coffee date is finished.
The end.</b>

853
00:59:22,456 --> 00:59:26,397
<b>Get up. Come on, get up.
Get up and go. Go now.</b>

854
00:59:26,397 --> 00:59:28,726
<b>Yes, of course.
I'll do as you say, Director Choi.</b>

855
00:59:30,466 --> 00:59:31,597
<b>Hey, wait.</b>

856
00:59:32,226 --> 00:59:34,697
<b>Can you leave that book here?
Let me read it.</b>

857
00:59:34,966 --> 00:59:37,167
<b>See? Don't you get curious too?</b>

858
00:59:37,167 --> 00:59:39,736
<b>I haven't finished it yet,
so read it quickly and give it back.</b>

859
00:59:41,577 --> 00:59:42,607
<b>Thanks.</b>

860
00:59:43,077 --> 00:59:44,107
<b>Gosh.</b>

861
00:59:44,177 --> 00:59:45,206
<b>Keep it up.</b>

862
00:59:45,677 --> 00:59:46,716
<b>Okay.</b>

863
00:59:49,687 --> 00:59:52,087
<b>"The Man Who Cannot Forget"?</b>

864
00:59:54,917 --> 00:59:56,327
<b>Are you sure you're okay?</b>

865
00:59:56,956 --> 00:59:58,056
<b>I'm fine.</b>

866
00:59:58,687 --> 01:00:01,296
<b>The doctor said
I can carry out my everyday life.</b>

867
01:00:02,357 --> 01:00:04,066
<b>But don't work too hard.</b>

868
01:00:04,066 --> 01:00:06,167
<b>If you have to carry something heavy
or do something tough,</b>

869
01:00:06,167 --> 01:00:07,437
<b>make someone else do it.</b>

870
01:00:08,137 --> 01:00:09,637
<b>I won't have to do
anything like that.</b>

871
01:00:09,637 --> 01:00:11,536
<b>But still. You never know.</b>

872
01:00:12,437 --> 01:00:13,437
<b>All right.</b>

873
01:00:14,536 --> 01:00:15,536
<b>This is great.</b>

874
01:00:16,847 --> 01:00:17,847
<b>What is?</b>

875
01:00:18,746 --> 01:00:20,647
<b>To have you worry about me.</b>

876
01:00:22,776 --> 01:00:25,387
<b>I'll do it so much from now on that
you'll get sick of it. Be ready.</b>

877
01:00:25,887 --> 01:00:26,917
<b>I'll look forward to it.</b>

878
01:00:27,816 --> 01:00:30,387
<b>I'm almost at work.
I'll call you later.</b>

879
01:00:31,157 --> 01:00:33,226
<b>Okay. Be careful.</b>

880
01:00:33,627 --> 01:00:35,226
<b>You really have to be careful.</b>

881
01:00:35,456 --> 01:00:36,466
<b>Okay.</b>

882
01:00:44,266 --> 01:00:46,137
<b>- Is that him?
- I don't think that's him.</b>

883
01:00:46,437 --> 01:00:47,976
<b>It's Anchor Lee Jeong Hoon!</b>

884
01:00:48,276 --> 01:00:51,306
<b>Anchor Lee, have you read the book
titled "The Man Who Cannot Forget"?</b>

885
01:00:51,306 --> 01:00:54,577
<b>Are you the man of this book?</b>

886
01:00:54,577 --> 01:00:56,587
<b>Is it true that
you suffer from hyperthymesia?</b>

887
01:00:56,587 --> 01:00:57,617
<b>Tell us something.</b>

888
01:00:57,617 --> 01:00:59,117
<b>- Say something.
- How are you feeling?</b>

889
01:00:59,117 --> 01:01:00,417
<b>- Excuse me.
- Say something!</b>

890
01:01:00,417 --> 01:01:01,917
<b>- Please say something.
- Anchor Lee!</b>

891
01:01:01,917 --> 01:01:05,026
<b>Did you know that
your story will get published?</b>

892
01:01:05,026 --> 01:01:06,427
<b>- Anchor Lee!
- Is this you?</b>

893
01:01:06,427 --> 01:01:07,796
<b>- What's your take on this?
- Say something!</b>

894
01:01:07,796 --> 01:01:09,867
<b>- Anchor Lee!
- Tell us something!</b>

895
01:01:09,867 --> 01:01:12,127
<b>- Say something!
- Anchor Lee!</b>

896
01:01:12,127 --> 01:01:13,397
<b>Hey, Lee Jeong Hoon!</b>

897
01:01:30,486 --> 01:01:32,786
<b>I picked up a huge scoop.</b>

898
01:01:33,887 --> 01:01:35,117
<b>Don't you want to know what it is?</b>

899
01:02:03,617 --> 01:02:05,887
<b>(Find Me in Your Memory)</b>

900
01:02:05,887 --> 01:02:09,316
<b>Now that everyone knows,
I'm a bit scared of their reactions.</b>

901
01:02:09,316 --> 01:02:10,526
<b>Did you miss me?</b>

902
01:02:10,526 --> 01:02:11,887
<b>Of course, I did.</b>

903
01:02:11,887 --> 01:02:13,127
<b>Okay, you pass.</b>

904
01:02:13,127 --> 01:02:14,127
<b>Did you read the book?</b>

905
01:02:14,127 --> 01:02:16,697
<b>Is that why you prepared this
to cheer me up?</b>

906
01:02:16,697 --> 01:02:18,927
<b>People forget
much faster than you think.</b>

907
01:02:18,927 --> 01:02:21,536
<b>So I don't want you to be
in too much pain.</b>

908
01:02:21,536 --> 01:02:23,107
<b>I found a new story.</b>

909
01:02:23,107 --> 01:02:24,667
<b>A woman he loved died,</b>

910
01:02:24,667 --> 01:02:26,736
<b>then he fell in love with
her best friend all over again.</b>

911
01:02:26,736 --> 01:02:29,077
<b>Why do they have to make
such a big deal out of this?</b>

912
01:02:29,077 --> 01:02:30,847
<b>I didn't think
it would blow up like this.</b>

913
01:02:30,847 --> 01:02:33,377
<b>It could be tougher than
what we expected,</b>

914
01:02:33,377 --> 01:02:35,617
<b>but let's live through this
like we did today.</b>
