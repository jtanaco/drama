<b>PORTRAYED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS</b>

4
00:00:28,435 --> 00:00:31,855
<i><b>It was the year

5
00:00:32,564 --> 00:00:34,608
<i><b>so it's been 24 years.</i></b>

<b>EPISODE 7</b>

7
00:00:37,986 --> 00:00:40,655
<b>Back then and even now,</b>

8
00:00:41,656 --> 00:00:44,492
<b>the view here is stunning.</b>

9
00:00:47,454 --> 00:00:49,164
<b>It seems too nice</b>

10
00:00:50,248 --> 00:00:52,417
<b>for a traitor's resting place.</b>

11
00:00:54,169 --> 00:00:57,464
<b>I thought about it sometimes.</b>

12
00:00:59,007 --> 00:01:01,510
<b>What was that body?</b>

13
00:01:02,677 --> 00:01:07,265
<b>Are you still bothered by how
we announced that the guards killed him?</b>

14
00:01:09,142 --> 00:01:14,606
<b>Back then, that was the only way
to protect the Royal Court.</b>

15
00:01:15,524 --> 00:01:16,942
<b>I know.</b>

16
00:01:18,068 --> 00:01:20,362
<b>And I made that choice.</b>

17
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:29,204
<b>Sometimes, life flows
in unexpected directions.</b>

18
00:01:33,458 --> 00:01:34,584
<b>This is the death certificate</b>

19
00:01:35,377 --> 00:01:38,838
<b>where the real cause of
Prince Imperial Geum's death is written.</b>

20
00:01:42,926 --> 00:01:44,928
<b>Usually when two people</b>

21
00:01:45,637 --> 00:01:48,014
<b>have a conversation like this,
one of them kills the other.</b>

22
00:01:51,059 --> 00:01:52,269
<b>That's an absurd joke...</b>

23
00:02:01,528 --> 00:02:03,571
<b>Is there something going on?</b>

24
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:08,785
<b>What did you talk about with His Majesty?</b>

25
00:02:09,786 --> 00:02:11,162
<b>About the truth.</b>

26
00:02:14,708 --> 00:02:15,709
<b>I'm sorry,</b>

27
00:02:16,584 --> 00:02:18,628
<b>but I hid something from you as well.</b>

28
00:02:20,088 --> 00:02:21,089
<b>It was neither a suicide</b>

29
00:02:22,048 --> 00:02:24,175
<b>nor a shooting by the Royal Guards.</b>

30
00:02:25,176 --> 00:02:26,011
<b>That body</b>

31
00:02:28,013 --> 00:02:30,348
<b>wasn't Prince Imperial Geum's.</b>

32

<b>Your Highness!</b>

33

<i><b>That traitor Lee Lim</i></b>

<i><b>If the purpose of his treason</i></b>

36
00:02:55,165 --> 00:02:56,291
<i><b>had been the Manpasikjeok</i></b>

37
00:02:57,042 --> 00:02:58,168
<i><b>and not the throne,</i></b>

38

39

41

<i><b>So</i></b>

42
00:03:13,099 --> 00:03:15,685
<i><b>Head Court Lady Noh was wrong.</i></b>

43

<i><b>Jeong Tae-eul is not a danger to me.</i></b>

44

<i><b>a danger to Jeong Tae-eul.</i></b>

46
00:03:42,712 --> 00:03:45,298
<b>Quick firing is a bit hard.</b>

47
00:03:46,216 --> 00:03:47,217
<b>Right?</b>

48
00:03:51,221 --> 00:03:52,055
<b>What?</b>

49
00:03:52,889 --> 00:03:54,349
<b>Did you put holes in it beforehand?</b>

50
00:03:54,933 --> 00:03:56,768
<b>Couldn't you have secretly
shot some on mine?</b>

51
00:03:57,602 --> 00:03:59,229
<b>Wow, Lieutenant Kang Sin-jae.</b>

52
00:03:59,312 --> 00:04:01,398
<b>I guess you'll get promoted first.</b>

53
00:04:03,024 --> 00:04:04,693
<b>You should've just worked at
the National Police Agency headquarters.</b>

54
00:04:04,776 --> 00:04:06,695
<b>Why would you work here when you graduated
from the National Police University?</b>

55
00:04:06,778 --> 00:04:08,571
<b>All your classmates
are Senior Inspectors now.</b>

56
00:04:08,738 --> 00:04:11,157
<b>You still have no clue about me.</b>

57
00:04:11,241 --> 00:04:13,451
<b>I'm not jealous at all
that they're Senior Inspectors.</b>

58
00:04:13,993 --> 00:04:16,037
<b>Then why are you so bent
on taking the promotion test?</b>

59
00:04:17,163 --> 00:04:18,998
<b>Because my friends
are all Senior Inspectors.</b>

60
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:21,876
<b>Don't worry, my physical abilities
can make up for my low scores.</b>

61
00:04:22,502 --> 00:04:24,045
<b>It won't help with the written exam.</b>

62
00:04:25,463 --> 00:04:27,757
<b>Hang on. I got a call. Oh, it's our Chief.</b>

63
00:04:29,968 --> 00:04:30,969
<b>Yes, Chief.</b>

64
00:04:33,096 --> 00:04:34,806
<b>All right, I'll be there right away.</b>

65
00:04:37,517 --> 00:04:39,018
<b>There was a murder in Changsin-dong.</b>

66
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:40,311
<b>You drive.</b>

67
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,403
<b>-Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty.</b>

68
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:49,946
<b>Your Majesty.</b>

69
00:04:50,029 --> 00:04:51,531
<b>Is the schedule confirmed
for China's visit?</b>

70
00:04:51,614 --> 00:04:54,868
<b>We should wait
until you've got plenty of rest--</b>

71
00:04:54,951 --> 00:04:56,494
<b>I want it scheduled as soon as possible.</b>

72
00:04:57,287 --> 00:04:58,830
<b>What other official schedules are there?</b>

73
00:04:58,913 --> 00:05:02,125
<b>You have to go to the National Tax Service
to receive the Best Taxpayer Award.</b>

74
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:03,251
<b>The people are responding</b>

75
00:05:03,334 --> 00:05:04,419
<b>-very positively--
-Great.</b>

76
00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:07,005
<b>You can receive the award on my behalf.</b>

77
00:05:07,088 --> 00:05:08,173
<b>And ask the Prime Minister's Office</b>

78
00:05:08,256 --> 00:05:10,008
<b>if they can make the state affairs report
in advance.</b>

79
00:05:10,091 --> 00:05:11,050
<b>Well...</b>

80
00:05:11,217 --> 00:05:12,427
<b>That is enough.</b>

81
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,928
<b>Don't try to convince me otherwise.</b>

82
00:05:15,513 --> 00:05:17,891
<b>How early do you want
the state affairs report?</b>

83
00:05:17,974 --> 00:05:18,808
<b>Tomorrow.</b>

84
00:05:19,434 --> 00:05:20,435
<b>-Tomorrow?
-Yes.</b>

85
00:05:20,518 --> 00:05:21,811
<b>And if not, His Majesty
will accept a written report.</b>

86
00:05:21,895 --> 00:05:24,189
<b>This is annoying.
Does he think I have time on my hands?</b>

87
00:05:24,272 --> 00:05:25,190
<b>Prime Minister.</b>

88
00:05:26,107 --> 00:05:27,650
<b>Was I being too nice these days?</b>

89
00:05:28,234 --> 00:05:29,861
<b>Let's play a little hard to get.</b>

90
00:05:30,612 --> 00:05:32,197
<b>Just send a simple written report.</b>

91
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,406
<b>Yes, ma'am.</b>

92
00:05:36,326 --> 00:05:38,912
<b>Your outfits for the National Assembly
this afternoon.</b>

93
00:05:39,954 --> 00:05:42,290
<b>We've referred to female politicians
of various countries</b>

94
00:05:42,582 --> 00:05:43,708
<b>and selected these suits.</b>

95
00:05:43,791 --> 00:05:45,043
<b>They're all pants.</b>

96
00:05:45,126 --> 00:05:48,171
<b>Well, most of the members are males,
so we picked more masculine outfits--</b>

97
00:05:48,254 --> 00:05:51,841
<b>Do women in politics have to wear
suits like that to win?</b>

98
00:05:52,884 --> 00:05:54,802
<b>I'll try to win
wearing the clothes that I like.</b>

99
00:05:55,595 --> 00:05:56,721
<b>Go and have lunch.</b>

100
00:06:04,395 --> 00:06:06,606
<b>What did that bitch have that I don't?</b>

101
00:06:10,652 --> 00:06:11,694
<b>Jangmi.</b>

102
00:06:11,778 --> 00:06:13,154
<b>-Hey, you're here.
-Yes.</b>

103
00:06:14,697 --> 00:06:16,241
<b>Go, get out of here.</b>

104
00:06:16,324 --> 00:06:17,534
<b>I'll get the security footage.</b>

105
00:06:17,617 --> 00:06:20,119
<b>-Take him away from here.
-Stop contaminating the crime scene. Go.</b>

106
00:06:20,703 --> 00:06:23,373
<b>The victim is a 26-year-old female,
and the weapon is a kitchen knife.</b>

107
00:06:23,456 --> 00:06:25,250
<b>It was reported by her roommate.</b>

108
00:06:26,167 --> 00:06:28,211
<b>Okay, I'll get her statement.</b>

109
00:06:28,294 --> 00:06:29,128
<b>Okay.</b>

110
00:06:29,963 --> 00:06:30,839
<b>Excuse me.</b>

111
00:06:32,674 --> 00:06:34,551
<b>I'm Lieutenant Jeong Tae-eul
from Jongno Station.</b>

112
00:06:35,718 --> 00:06:39,180
<b>I know you're in shock, but you need to
come to the station to make a statement.</b>

113
00:06:40,348 --> 00:06:41,391
<b>Right now?</b>

114
00:06:41,641 --> 00:06:42,559
<b>Yes.</b>

115
00:06:53,903 --> 00:06:54,779
<b>Give me a briefing.</b>

116
00:06:55,113 --> 00:06:56,698
<b>There are two wounds on her neck,</b>

117
00:06:57,323 --> 00:06:58,491
<b>but her posture is natural.</b>

118
00:06:58,741 --> 00:07:00,785
<b>She was attacked by surprise
while lying down.</b>

119
00:07:02,161 --> 00:07:04,163
<b>The first wound was critical.</b>

120
00:07:04,664 --> 00:07:06,749
<b>With a cut this deep,
she couldn't have put up a fight.</b>

121
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:08,251
<b>There are no signs of entry</b>

122
00:07:08,835 --> 00:07:10,712
<b>and she had a facial mask on.</b>

123
00:07:10,837 --> 00:07:12,338
<b>The killer was likely an acquaintance.</b>

124
00:07:32,275 --> 00:07:33,568
<b>Why is the weapon so clean?</b>

125
00:07:33,651 --> 00:07:35,820
<b>The killer put it back where it was
after washing it.</b>

126
00:07:36,321 --> 00:07:37,864
<b>They tried to get rid of the evidence.</b>

127
00:07:37,947 --> 00:07:39,073
<b>So it's a first offender.</b>

128
00:07:39,157 --> 00:07:41,367
<b>Even kids know
they should wear latex gloves.</b>

129
00:07:42,535 --> 00:07:44,203
<b>Hey, our vulnerable Jangmi.</b>

130
00:07:44,287 --> 00:07:45,413
<b>Did you find anything?</b>

131
00:07:48,082 --> 00:07:50,418
<b>I'm certain that Yu Jeong-hwa
from the Royal Wardrobe</b>

132
00:07:50,501 --> 00:07:52,879
<b>is the one who's been meeting
the Prime Minister's secretary.</b>

133
00:07:53,504 --> 00:07:55,757
<b>There cannot be any mistakes
regarding this issue.</b>

134
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,217
<b>Based on when the guards changed posts,</b>

135
00:07:58,301 --> 00:08:01,554
<b>a total of 32 palace workers
met His Majesty in person this month.</b>

136
00:08:02,138 --> 00:08:03,932
<b>And 21 of them have social media accounts.</b>

137
00:08:04,265 --> 00:08:07,727
<b>I followed around 40 personal accounts
that they use, and I found this.</b>

138
00:08:08,853 --> 00:08:11,439
<b>The same location, the same table
from a different angle,</b>

139
00:08:11,522 --> 00:08:13,024
<b>and photos in the same style.</b>

140
00:08:13,691 --> 00:08:14,525
<b>And most importantly,</b>

141
00:08:15,526 --> 00:08:17,612
<b>their faces are reflected on these spoons.</b>

142
00:08:23,743 --> 00:08:24,953
<b>It's totally obvious, then.</b>

143
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:31,626
<b>A palace worker spying on
His Majesty and spreading rumors,</b>

144
00:08:32,794 --> 00:08:35,797
<b>and even stealing and leaking something
from the palace...</b>

145
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,299
<b>That counts as treason.</b>

146
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,426
<b>Who put you up to this?</b>

147
00:08:42,095 --> 00:08:44,514
<b>Who ordered you to spy on His Majesty?</b>

148
00:08:47,767 --> 00:08:49,686
<b>Head Court Lady Noh, I'm sorry.</b>

149
00:08:50,353 --> 00:08:54,190
<b>I said His Majesty seemed to have
gotten a girlfriend,</b>

150
00:08:54,565 --> 00:08:56,484
<b>but I never stole anything.</b>

151
00:08:57,735 --> 00:09:00,488
<b>I was on duty on November 11th,</b>

152
00:09:00,571 --> 00:09:02,865
<b>and His Majesty came to the Royal Kitchen.</b>

153
00:09:03,491 --> 00:09:05,076
<b>And he cooked food himself.</b>

154
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:06,911
<b>So I could tell right away</b>

155
00:09:08,538 --> 00:09:09,872

309
00:18:23,259 --> 00:18:27,721
<b>I'll get chocolate milk tea.
Use this. And I want lots of cereal.</b>

310
00:18:28,305 --> 00:18:29,389
<b>Good choice.</b>

311
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:32,810
<b>You know I always want to
cut my hair short</b>

312
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:34,353
<b>around this time of year.</b>

313
00:18:34,812 --> 00:18:36,480
<b>I tried a simulation with a wig.</b>

314
00:18:37,314 --> 00:18:38,857
<b>But I look better with long hair, right?</b>

315
00:18:39,692 --> 00:18:43,404
<b>You're coming here
less often these days, though.</b>

316
00:18:44,238 --> 00:18:45,698
<b>Are you going to a different cafe?</b>

317
00:18:49,493 --> 00:18:50,369
<b>Hey.</b>

318
00:18:50,953 --> 00:18:53,163
<b>You're much better than my dad.</b>

319
00:18:53,539 --> 00:18:56,750
<b>He didn't even notice
when I stayed out all night.</b>

320
00:18:57,418 --> 00:18:59,461
<b>You've gotten better at bluffing
since I last saw you.</b>

321
00:19:00,087 --> 00:19:02,881
<b>Who describes stakeouts like that?</b>

322
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:04,592
<b>You were just working.</b>

323
00:19:09,221 --> 00:19:10,889
<b>No, it wasn't a stakeout.</b>

324
00:19:11,849 --> 00:19:14,977
<b>I really spent the night at a guy's house.</b>

325
00:19:16,061 --> 00:19:17,479
<b>His house was pretty big.</b>

326
00:19:18,606 --> 00:19:21,025
<b>Welcome to my palace.</b>

327
00:19:24,612 --> 00:19:25,446
<b>Good for you.</b>

328
00:19:32,953 --> 00:19:34,121
<b>It's crunchy.</b>

329
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:38,834
<b>By the way, Na-ri.</b>

330
00:19:40,544 --> 00:19:41,754
<b>Let's say</b>

331
00:19:43,005 --> 00:19:44,465
<b>there's another world,</b>

332
00:19:45,841 --> 00:19:46,675
<b>and...</b>

333
00:19:47,635 --> 00:19:49,887
<b>there's someone who looks
exactly like you there.</b>

334
00:19:50,971 --> 00:19:53,182
<b>How would you feel</b>

335
00:19:54,558 --> 00:19:55,851
<b>if you meet that someone?</b>

336
00:19:55,934 --> 00:19:57,353
<b>Are you talking about doppelgangers?</b>

337
00:19:58,395 --> 00:19:59,605
<b>I have to kill her, of course.</b>

338
00:19:59,688 --> 00:20:02,816
<b>Hey. How can you say such a thing
in front of a detective?</b>

339
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:06,070
<b>One of the doppelgangers
always ends up dying.</b>

340
00:20:06,654 --> 00:20:07,946
<b>That's the rule of the universe.</b>

341
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:21,543
<b>Why is that the rule?</b>

342
00:20:21,627 --> 00:20:24,213
<b>If there's two of something
when there's just supposed to be one,</b>

343
00:20:24,296 --> 00:20:25,839
<b>it will cause chaos in the world.</b>

344
00:20:26,715 --> 00:20:29,426
<b>One cafe in this alley is enough,</b>

345
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:32,054
<b>and Hero Taekwondo center is enough
for this neighborhood.</b>

346
00:20:32,638 --> 00:20:34,098
<b>The world needs balance.</b>

347
00:20:35,182 --> 00:20:38,060
<b>Tae-eul, why else would NASA
hide the existence of aliens?</b>

348
00:20:38,143 --> 00:20:39,353
<b>If there are two worlds,</b>

349
00:20:39,436 --> 00:20:42,981
<b>then one world is bound to
destroy the other.</b>

350
00:20:44,316 --> 00:20:45,859
<b>We can't be the one that's destroyed.</b>

351
00:20:59,206 --> 00:21:00,708
<b>I have to go now.</b>

352
00:21:01,542 --> 00:21:02,835
<b>Take care.</b>

353
00:21:03,836 --> 00:21:05,587
<b>Just take me to the bamboo forest today.</b>

354
00:21:07,715 --> 00:21:10,676
<b>Answer quietly, all right?</b>

355
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:12,886
<b>Your Majesty!</b>

356
00:21:24,732 --> 00:21:26,316
<b>I didn't know Your Majesty was coming.</b>

357
00:21:27,109 --> 00:21:28,193
<b>Did your schedule change?</b>

358
00:21:28,777 --> 00:21:31,196
<b>The weather was nice,
so I just dropped by.</b>

359
00:21:31,572 --> 00:21:33,782
<b>-All right, Your Majesty.
-Go on with your work, then.</b>

360
00:21:39,079 --> 00:21:39,955
<b>Go.</b>

361
00:21:56,138 --> 00:21:56,972
<b>Giddy-up!</b>

362
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:09,610
<b>No wonder.</b>

363
00:22:10,402 --> 00:22:12,905
<b>I thought it was too easy
exiting the palace.</b>

364
00:22:13,697 --> 00:22:14,573
<b>Were you waiting here?</b>

365
00:22:14,656 --> 00:22:16,783
<b>Where are you going again
with your phone off?</b>

366
00:22:17,367 --> 00:22:19,536
<b>-Are you going to meet Luna again?
-Who's Luna?</b>

367
00:22:21,121 --> 00:22:21,955
<b>Your Majesty,</b>

368
00:22:22,664 --> 00:22:23,874
<b>you've been deceived.</b>

369
00:22:25,292 --> 00:22:26,960
<b>That woman isn't Jeong Tae-eul.</b>

370
00:22:27,503 --> 00:22:29,087
<b>She's a criminal called Luna.</b>

371
00:22:29,171 --> 00:22:30,172
<b>I'm pretty sure she's not.</b>

372
00:22:30,756 --> 00:22:32,174
<b>She's the one catching criminals.</b>

373
00:22:32,257 --> 00:22:33,425
<b>Your Majesty...</b>

374
00:22:35,344 --> 00:22:37,930
<b>Gangsters and the police
are all looking for that woman.</b>

375
00:22:38,597 --> 00:22:41,433
<b>Document forgery, theft, breaking
and entering, assault, pickpocketing...</b>

376
00:22:41,725 --> 00:22:45,270
<b>There are hundreds of reports on her.
She just hasn't been caught yet.</b>

377
00:22:45,854 --> 00:22:47,272
<b>So you're saying</b>

378
00:22:48,273 --> 00:22:51,401
<b>that there's a woman
with the same face as Jeong Tae-eul</b>

379
00:22:52,778 --> 00:22:53,987
<b>in this Kingdom, right?</b>

380
00:22:56,198 --> 00:22:57,574
<b>Not the same face.</b>

381
00:22:58,075 --> 00:23:01,161
<b>-It's the same person.
-And where is this person called Luna?</b>

382
00:23:01,245 --> 00:23:03,205
<b>I'm sure you would know better than anyone</b>

383
00:23:03,705 --> 00:23:05,207
<b>where she is right now.</b>

384
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:06,625
<b>The same face</b>

385
00:23:08,418 --> 00:23:09,336
<b>exists</b>

386
00:23:10,003 --> 00:23:11,129
<b>in the Kingdom of Corea.</b>

387
00:23:12,714 --> 00:23:14,800
<b>Even if you look at me like that,
you can't go.</b>

388
00:23:15,425 --> 00:23:17,386
<b>If you must go,
you'll either have to kill me</b>

389
00:23:17,803 --> 00:23:18,637
<b>or take me with you.</b>

390
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,721
<b>Make your choice.</b>

391
00:23:19,805 --> 00:23:21,723
<b>-I choose number one.
-I'm better than you with swords.</b>

392
00:23:22,307 --> 00:23:23,308
<b>Then number two.</b>

393
00:23:25,727 --> 00:23:27,229
<b>How can you be joking right now?</b>

394
00:23:28,605 --> 00:23:30,274
<b>I told these jerks to stand by.</b>

395
00:23:34,027 --> 00:23:36,446
<i><b>Don't worry about the palace
and enjoy your vacation.</i></b>

396
00:23:37,739 --> 00:23:39,032
<b>-Vacation?
-It's Ho-pil, right?</b>

397
00:23:39,825 --> 00:23:41,618
<b>I texted Ho-pil saying</b>

398
00:23:42,536 --> 00:23:44,246
<b>you're going on a long vacation.</b>

399
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,373
<b>I'm going on vacation?</b>

400
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:48,250
<b>Yes, we're leaving our horses behind.</b>

401
00:23:49,167 --> 00:23:52,087
<b>I believe two horses in that yard
is a bit too much.</b>

402
00:23:52,879 --> 00:23:54,881
<b>You didn't read the link I sent you,</b>

403
00:23:54,965 --> 00:23:57,009
<b>and you won't believe me
even if I explain it to you.</b>

404
00:23:57,092 --> 00:23:58,343
<b>So</b>

405
00:23:58,677 --> 00:24:00,053
<b>I'm just going to take you there</b>

406
00:24:00,762 --> 00:24:02,139
<b>so you can see for yourself.</b>

407
00:24:02,222 --> 00:24:04,099
<b>See what for myself?</b>

408
00:24:04,725 --> 00:24:05,642
<b>What's between one and zero.</b>

409
00:24:06,476 --> 00:24:08,478
<b>And that Jeong Tae-eul
and the person you're chasing</b>

410
00:24:08,854 --> 00:24:10,105
<b>are different people.</b>

411
00:24:11,315 --> 00:24:12,608
<b>And then I'll find that person</b>

412
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:14,860
<b>with the same face as Tae-eul.</b>

413
00:24:31,501 --> 00:24:32,377
<b>Your Majesty...</b>

414
00:24:34,671 --> 00:24:35,797
<b>This is just the beginning.</b>

415
00:24:36,965 --> 00:24:37,924
<b>We're going to be</b>

416
00:24:38,634 --> 00:24:40,260
<b>entering another world now.</b>

417
00:25:13,669 --> 00:25:15,671
<b>Prince Imperial Geum!</b>

418
00:25:22,511 --> 00:25:24,179
<b>You idiot.</b>

419
00:25:24,805 --> 00:25:27,599
<b>Don't bow to people like that
with my father's face!</b>

420
00:25:28,642 --> 00:25:29,476
<b>Stand up.</b>

421
00:25:30,602 --> 00:25:32,396
<b>Our conversation will last a while.</b>

422
00:25:32,646 --> 00:25:34,731
<b>Yes, Your Highness.</b>

423
00:25:36,608 --> 00:25:37,859
<b>So what will you do?</b>

424
00:25:38,402 --> 00:25:40,070
<b>The succession process is almost over</b>

425
00:25:41,738 --> 00:25:43,907
<b>but that idiot is dawdling.</b>

426
00:26:02,509 --> 00:26:04,386
<b>He's left the palace again.</b>

427
00:26:20,193 --> 00:26:22,738
<b>Why does he keep leaving?</b>

428
00:26:26,241 --> 00:26:27,826
<b>It keeps getting postponed.</b>

429
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:31,163
<b>Why don't you do something?
I'm sure he'll listen to you.</b>

430
00:26:38,879 --> 00:26:40,630
<b>What do you want to do</b>

431
00:26:41,089 --> 00:26:42,966
<b>after the succession process is over?</b>

432
00:26:44,634 --> 00:26:45,719
<b>It's simple.</b>

433
00:26:45,802 --> 00:26:48,013
<b>We'll say he got sick and retired</b>

434
00:26:48,472 --> 00:26:50,932
<b>and send him off somewhere abroad
since he's done with his work.</b>

435
00:26:52,434 --> 00:26:54,019
<b>Do you agree with that?</b>

436
00:26:54,811 --> 00:26:58,398
<b>I will do as you order, Your Highness.</b>

437
00:26:58,982 --> 00:27:00,400
<b>He's acting like that again!</b>

438
00:27:00,484 --> 00:27:02,402
<b>What a load of nonsense.</b>

439
00:27:02,736 --> 00:27:04,905
<b>I'm the one who asked you
to bring that idiot,</b>

440
00:27:04,988 --> 00:27:06,865
<b>but he only listens to you, and not me.</b>

441
00:27:06,948 --> 00:27:08,533
<b>-Damn it!
-The succession</b>

442
00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:11,661
<b>will end smoothly.</b>

443
00:27:11,745 --> 00:27:12,746
<b>That's obvious!</b>

444
00:27:12,829 --> 00:27:14,331
<b>I'm asking when that will happen! Shit.</b>

445
00:27:16,041 --> 00:27:19,795
<b>And if it's nothing urgent,
let's just talk over the phone, all right?</b>

446
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:22,297
<b>Stop ordering me to go back and forth...</b>

447

<b>Your carefree attitude is what's cute.</b>

<b>Eun...</b>

<b>You two haven't met, right?</b>

00:36:24,585 --> 00:36:25,919
<b>Why don't I introduce...</b>

558
00:36:30,299 --> 00:36:32,676
<b>Well, I guess we could say
you've met already.</b>

559

<b>Anyway, this is my guard,
the Unbreakable Sword, Jo Yeong.</b>

560
00:36:36,638 --> 00:36:38,682
<b>And this is a guard of a police station...</b>

00:36:41,310 --> 00:36:43,020
<b>Hey! Jo Eun-sup!</b>

562
00:36:45,439 --> 00:36:47,232
<b>I can't believe it! You made him faint!</b>

563
00:36:48,067 --> 00:36:50,110
<b>What? Did you say he wouldn't get caught?</b>

564
00:36:50,819 --> 00:36:53,572
<b>Eun-sup was also raised

<b>until his twin siblings were born.</b>

<b>What are you going to do

567
00:36:58,035 --> 00:36:59,161
<b>Eun-sup!</b>

00:37:00,913 --> 00:37:01,914
<b>Oh, my gosh!</b>

570
00:37:02,498 --> 00:37:03,707
<b>What happened?</b>

571
00:37:03,791 --> 00:37:05,751
<b>Tae-eul...</b>

572
00:37:06,502 --> 00:37:10,047
<b>I literally just saw someone

<b>Wow...</b>

<b>He looks exactly like me.</b>

00:37:27,439 --> 00:37:28,440
<b>No.</b>

578
00:37:29,066 --> 00:37:30,567
<b>He is me.</b>

<b>Who are you?</b>

580
00:37:35,531 --> 00:37:36,407

<b>Eun-sup.</b>

00:37:39,701 --> 00:37:40,869
<b>Let me explain.</b>

583
00:37:41,453 --> 00:37:44,039
<b>So this is like a parallel universe

584
00:37:44,123 --> 00:37:45,958
<b>Don't get too startled, all right?</b>

585
00:37:47,042 --> 00:37:50,379
<b>I didn't realize until now,
but I'm pretty handsome.</b>

586
00:37:52,673 --> 00:37:54,216
<b>You really didn't know?</b>

587
00:37:56,093 --> 00:37:57,261
<b>How could you not know?</b>

588
00:37:58,470 --> 00:38:00,931
<b>I'm sure people around you
would've told you all the time.</b>

589
00:38:01,098 --> 00:38:04,059
<b>Why didn't you tell me?</b>

590
00:38:07,396 --> 00:38:08,897
<b>Hang on, that's not the point here.</b>

591
00:38:11,608 --> 00:38:14,611
<b>So then this means
everything was true, right?</b>

592
00:38:14,695 --> 00:38:17,114
<b>The Kingdom of Corea really exists,</b>

593
00:38:17,197 --> 00:38:19,283
<b>and King Arthur here really is the King?</b>

594
00:38:19,491 --> 00:38:20,325
<b>Wow.</b>

595
00:38:20,993 --> 00:38:21,827

<b>Then you're the King's bodyguard, right?</b>

597
00:38:26,206 --> 00:38:27,082
<b>No.</b>

598

<b>Are you doing military duties right now?</b>

599
00:38:31,962 --> 00:38:33,172
<b>Yes.</b>

600
00:38:33,422 --> 00:38:36,091
<b>-Is military service compulsory here?
-What do you mean?</b>

601
00:38:36,175 --> 00:38:37,509
<b>Is it different where you live?</b>

602
00:38:37,593 --> 00:38:40,512
<b>-We have a volunteer military system.
-Yes, I guess it could be different.</b>

603
00:38:41,263 --> 00:38:44,349
<b>What? Then you don't need to...</b>

604
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,399
<b>Why don't we</b>

605
00:38:53,567 --> 00:38:55,319
<b>go to his house first?</b>

606
00:38:55,652 --> 00:38:57,112
<b>It'll be the safest there.</b>

607
00:39:01,450 --> 00:39:02,951
<b>What's that guy doing?</b>

608
00:39:04,578 --> 00:39:06,788
<b>A security check. It's his job.</b>

609
00:39:09,416 --> 00:39:10,292
<b>Everything is clear.</b>

610
00:39:10,959 --> 00:39:13,795
<b>Wow, I guess you can tell
just by looking around.</b>

611
00:39:13,879 --> 00:39:15,881
<b>You look pretty professional.</b>

612
00:39:16,632 --> 00:39:17,758
<b>Why don't you?</b>

613

615
00:39:27,184 --> 00:39:28,101
<b>Did you even know that?</b>

616
00:39:31,188 --> 00:39:32,064
<b>Well...</b>

617
00:39:33,065 --> 00:39:34,233
<b>Something came up.</b>

618
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:38,570
<b>What would you know?</b>

619
00:39:40,489 --> 00:39:41,365
<b>Your Majesty,</b>

620
00:39:42,616 --> 00:39:44,868
<b>I just realized my 63rd dream.</b>

621
00:39:46,286 --> 00:39:47,162
<b>In my next life,</b>

622
00:39:47,829 --> 00:39:50,499
<b>I really want to be
a citizen of your Kingdom.</b>

623
00:39:55,045 --> 00:39:56,046
<b>I won't allow that.</b>

624
00:39:57,673 --> 00:39:59,800
<b>All right, why don't we have dinner first?</b>

625
00:40:00,717 --> 00:40:02,553
<b>How about half and half?</b>

626
00:40:03,428 --> 00:40:04,721
<b>Yeong should try it too.</b>

627
00:40:05,514 --> 00:40:08,600
<b>You're crazy.
How can you think about chicken right now?</b>

628
00:40:08,684 --> 00:40:09,893
<b>I'll shoot him if you order me to.</b>

629
00:40:10,519 --> 00:40:11,603
<b>What...</b>

630
00:40:15,607 --> 00:40:17,568
<b>Hey! Put that down.</b>

631
00:40:17,734 --> 00:40:20,195
<b>You can't use a gun! It's illegal here.</b>

632
00:40:28,704 --> 00:40:31,123
<b>Both of you, sit down.</b>

633
00:40:46,930 --> 00:40:48,140
<b>We need to make some rules.</b>

634
00:40:49,683 --> 00:40:52,394
<b>You'll stay here until you find
another place to stay.</b>

635
00:40:53,395 --> 00:40:55,439
<b>And you shouldn't
be outside at the same time.</b>

636
00:40:55,689 --> 00:40:57,858
<b>During the day, Eun-sup can go out.</b>

637
00:40:58,025 --> 00:40:59,568
<b>And Mr. Jo can go out at night.</b>

638
00:41:00,235 --> 00:41:01,653
<b>-Why should I?
-Why should I do that?</b>

639
00:41:02,863 --> 00:41:04,323
<b>Do you have a death wish?</b>

640
00:41:04,823 --> 00:41:05,657
<b>No.</b>

641
00:41:07,075 --> 00:41:08,619
<b>I'm talking to both of you.</b>

642
00:41:09,995 --> 00:41:13,624
<b>If it's a problem that we look identical,
we can solve it by eliminating one.</b>

643
00:41:17,169 --> 00:41:18,337
<b>What?</b>

644
00:41:19,921 --> 00:41:21,798
<b>Why are you all looking at me?</b>

645
00:41:22,549 --> 00:41:24,343
<b>Wait.</b>

646
00:41:24,593 --> 00:41:27,721
<b>Gosh, I was trying to live a quiet life
without causing trouble.</b>

647
00:41:27,888 --> 00:41:29,556
<b>Don't regret this later saying</b>

648
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:32,517
<b>"I didn't know you'd do this," okay?</b>

649
00:41:33,518 --> 00:41:34,436
<b>Eun-sup.</b>

650
00:41:35,062 --> 00:41:37,272
<b>I got you fruit and some other stuff.</b>

651
00:41:38,315 --> 00:41:39,816
<b>Don't leave the house, okay?</b>

652
00:41:43,487 --> 00:41:45,572
<b>And Mr. Lee, follow me.</b>

653
00:41:45,656 --> 00:41:47,449
<b>How dare you call His Majesty that...</b>

654
00:41:49,993 --> 00:41:52,037
<b>Is this how they've been
treating you here?</b>

655
00:41:52,579 --> 00:41:53,538
<b>Yes,</b>

656
00:41:54,456 --> 00:41:55,332
<b>I missed it.</b>

657
00:41:56,333 --> 00:41:59,002
<b>She used to just call me
"Hey" or "Mister."</b>

658
00:41:59,586 --> 00:42:00,712
<b>Hey...</b>

659
00:42:02,255 --> 00:42:04,091
<b>Don't kill him,
he belongs to the government.</b>

660
00:42:21,024 --> 00:42:22,109
<b>Where are your parents?</b>

661
00:42:22,234 --> 00:42:24,569
<b>In Busan. I'm from Busan.</b>

662
00:42:26,947 --> 00:42:28,699
<b>Do your parents have the same faces, too?</b>

663
00:42:32,452 --> 00:42:33,453
<b>Who are they?</b>

664
00:42:34,663 --> 00:42:35,622
<b>Did you get married?</b>

665
00:42:36,790 --> 00:42:37,999
<b>They're my twin siblings.</b>

666
00:42:38,083 --> 00:42:39,710
<b>They're in Busan for the holidays.</b>

667
00:42:41,253 --> 00:42:42,254
<b>Don't you have siblings?</b>

668
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:44,381
<b>No, I'm an only child.</b>

669
00:42:45,882 --> 00:42:46,758
<b>An only child.</b>

670
00:42:47,342 --> 00:42:51,346
<b>Well, I guess your parents
weren't as close as mine.</b>

671
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:53,223
<b>They got divorced.</b>

672
00:42:56,393 --> 00:42:57,561
<b>Oh, I'm sorry.</b>

673
00:43:01,064 --> 00:43:02,107
<b>Do you want a hug?</b>

674
00:43:03,108 --> 00:43:05,694
<b>Gosh! You really have a bad personality!</b>

675
00:43:06,278 --> 00:43:08,113
<b>I bet you don't even have a girlfriend.</b>

676
00:43:08,739 --> 00:43:09,573
<b>Neither do you.</b>

677
00:43:09,656 --> 00:43:10,615
<b>I have a boyfriend.</b>

678
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:13,326
<b>-What?
-Did you believe that?</b>

679
00:43:13,994 --> 00:43:14,995
<b>You're more gullible than I thought.</b>

680
00:43:15,579 --> 00:43:16,997
<b>Did you eat?
If you didn't, I'll make something.</b>

681
00:43:18,331 --> 00:43:20,625
<b>Nobody is stupid enough
to eat at an enemy's camp.</b>

682
00:43:23,003 --> 00:43:25,881
<b>Do you guys usually talk
like you're in a historical drama?</b>

683
00:43:26,506 --> 00:43:28,425
<b>Come to think of it,
you don't talk in a dialect.</b>

684
00:43:29,718 --> 00:43:31,094
<b>I can use standard Korean, too.</b>

685
00:43:32,846 --> 00:43:35,056
<b>Do you want to eat something?
Would you like some noodles?</b>

686
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:36,767
<b>Is there anything you can do properly?</b>

687
00:43:37,642 --> 00:43:40,604
<b>How can someone have 63 dreams?
Are you making deposit accounts or what?</b>

688
00:43:41,313 --> 00:43:43,398
<b>Which one has the highest
chance of getting fulfilled?</b>

689
00:43:44,983 --> 00:43:47,110
<b>Becoming a civilian, of course.</b>

690
00:43:47,194 --> 00:43:50,405
<b>I'm fulfilling that dream in two days.
My military service ends in two days.</b>

691
00:43:50,489 --> 00:43:53,408
<b>In two days you'll become a bum
who doesn't even protect the country?</b>

692
00:43:53,992 --> 00:43:56,369
<b>Hey, you're pretty harsh.</b>

693
00:43:56,453 --> 00:43:59,790
<b>You know, you might have
more muscles than me,</b>

694
00:43:59,915 --> 00:44:01,541
<b>but I'm pretty good at fighting too.</b>

695
00:44:01,625 --> 00:44:03,043
<b>Try me.</b>

696
00:44:07,631 --> 00:44:09,174
<b>Don't think about shooting me from behind.</b>

697
00:44:11,009 --> 00:44:12,177
<b>The Republic of Korea...</b>

698
00:44:13,595 --> 00:44:14,763
<b>What kind of country is this</b>

699
00:44:14,846 --> 00:44:16,932
<b>to let a fool like you
protect the country?</b>

700
00:44:34,783 --> 00:44:37,369
<b>TAEKWONDO CENTER</b>

701
00:44:44,709 --> 00:44:46,795
<b>Here, this is my MSD.</b>

702
00:44:46,878 --> 00:44:49,005
<b>Try it. It's <i>somaek</i>. Drink all of it.</b>

703
00:44:56,388 --> 00:44:57,514
<b>It's quite similar.</b>

704
00:45:01,059 --> 00:45:02,644
<b>Unlike someone,
I live off of chicken feed of a salary</b>

705
00:45:02,727 --> 00:45:04,312
<b>and I don't have a mountain
full of rare-earth elements.</b>

706
00:45:04,396 --> 00:45:06,606
<b>So I bought it
with a 12-month installment plan.</b>

707
00:45:06,982 --> 00:45:09,776
<b>Don't break it and take care of it.
Don't forget to answer my calls.</b>

708
00:45:10,861 --> 00:45:13,405
<b>I saved all the numbers you will need
in this world.</b>

709
00:45:13,488 --> 00:45:15,323
<b>It seems like you bought it
and waited for me to come back.</b>

710
00:45:20,370 --> 00:45:21,830
<b>Why did you save Sin-jae's number?</b>

711
00:45:21,913 --> 00:45:24,165
<b>They are the five people who will help you</b>

712
00:45:24,666 --> 00:45:26,293
<b>regardless of what in this world.</b>

713
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:29,212
<b>And Sin-jae
is one of the most trustworthy people.</b>

714
00:45:29,588 --> 00:45:30,630
<b>Not you?</b>

715
00:45:30,714 --> 00:45:32,132
<b>For me, the citizens come first.</b>

716
00:45:37,804 --> 00:45:38,972
<b>Who are you calling?</b>

717
00:45:44,686 --> 00:45:46,438
<b>LEE GON</b>

718
00:45:49,691 --> 00:45:50,567
<b>Is it you?</b>

719
00:45:52,027 --> 00:45:53,945
<b>-Hang up.
-Don't hang up.</b>

720
00:45:54,613 --> 00:45:56,072
<b>I always wanted to try this.</b>

721
00:45:56,907 --> 00:45:58,116
<b>What is this?</b>

722
00:45:58,366 --> 00:45:59,743
<b>Just a normal daily life with you.</b>

723
00:46:00,035 --> 00:46:01,578
<b>Call you...</b>

724
00:46:01,661 --> 00:46:03,455
<b>Chat on the phone...</b>

725
00:46:04,372 --> 00:46:05,874
<b>Ask you what you did today...</b>

726
00:46:06,750 --> 00:46:08,710
<b>And tell you that I missed you</b>

727
00:46:09,336 --> 00:46:10,420
<b>a lot.</b>

728
00:46:15,091 --> 00:46:16,217
<b>Me too.</b>

729
00:46:17,677 --> 00:46:18,511
<b>I see.</b>

730
00:46:20,597 --> 00:46:22,015
<b>Here is the chicken you ordered.</b>

731
00:46:22,098 --> 00:46:23,266
<b>Enjoy.</b>

732
00:46:32,525 --> 00:46:35,737
<b>I'm tasting it beforehand
since I can't cook.</b>

733
00:46:37,489 --> 00:46:38,490
<b>You don't have to.</b>

734
00:46:39,032 --> 00:46:41,034
<b>I know our worlds
are completely different.</b>

735
00:46:42,202 --> 00:46:43,370
<b>But let's try to shorten the gap.</b>

736
00:46:52,712 --> 00:46:54,047
<b>This also tastes great.</b>

737
00:46:55,632 --> 00:46:56,841
<b>Fine, but let go of my hand.</b>

738
00:46:56,925 --> 00:46:57,926
<b>Never.</b>

739
00:46:58,009 --> 00:46:59,177
<b>Then grab my left hand.</b>

740
00:47:09,771 --> 00:47:10,981
<b>Why did you put those sunglasses on?</b>

741
00:47:11,356 --> 00:47:13,400
<b>We have somewhere to go after we eat.</b>

742
00:47:13,984 --> 00:47:16,152
<b>It's a daily life I've been planning
for a long time.</b>

743
00:47:16,945 --> 00:47:19,656
<b>You know, I get nervous
when you equip something.</b>

744
00:47:21,866 --> 00:47:22,701
<b>Is this the place?</b>

745
00:47:25,912 --> 00:47:26,746
<b>Welcome...</b>

746
00:47:28,123 --> 00:47:29,708
<b>Oh, it's you again.</b>

747
00:47:31,835 --> 00:47:33,712
<b>You brought your girlfriend today.</b>

748
00:47:34,004 --> 00:47:37,007
<b>If you hit the target seven times,
you can win this.</b>

749
00:47:37,173 --> 00:47:38,758
<b>How many bullets do you want?</b>

750
00:47:39,342 --> 00:47:40,844
<b>Seven is enough.</b>

751
00:47:40,927 --> 00:47:43,221
<b>Right, of course.</b>

752
00:47:43,638 --> 00:47:45,765
<b>Are you going to try this time?</b>

753
00:47:46,057 --> 00:47:47,809
<b>Right. You can hit them
with your eyes closed</b>

754
00:47:47,892 --> 00:47:49,894
<b>if you have a boyfriend
who's served in the military.</b>

755
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:51,021
<b>Yes.</b>

756
00:48:09,789 --> 00:48:11,374
<b>Did you have a boyfriend
who's served in the military?</b>

757
00:48:11,458 --> 00:48:13,168
<b>"With my eyes closed" is the point here.</b>

758
00:48:25,221 --> 00:48:26,514
<b>Can you really see with that on?</b>

759
00:48:28,433 --> 00:48:32,353
<b>Shooting is the act of filling the void
between me and the target.</b>

760
00:48:32,437 --> 00:48:34,481
<b>It's too late if you shoot after you look.
You need to look after you shoot.</b>

761
00:48:34,689 --> 00:48:36,649
<b>What else do you need?
Should I shoot down a star for you? Bang!</b>

762
00:48:39,778 --> 00:48:40,904
<b>Are you sure you earned this?</b>

763
00:48:41,321 --> 00:48:42,405
<b>Or did you just pay for it?</b>

764
00:48:44,407 --> 00:48:46,409
<b>If we have time,
let's go to Hongdae next time.</b>

765
00:48:46,493 --> 00:48:48,995
<b>There's a teddy bear as big as you.</b>

766
00:48:49,079 --> 00:48:50,205
<b>Hongdae?</b>

767
00:48:51,247 --> 00:48:52,624
<b>Is that the name of a neighborhood?</b>

768
00:48:54,084 --> 00:48:54,959
<b>Then do you know</b>

769
00:48:55,585 --> 00:48:58,713
<b>what "the relationship between
Hongdae and Kondae" means?</b>

770
00:48:58,797 --> 00:49:01,591
<b>They're both universities.
They're not that close to each other.</b>

771
00:49:02,092 --> 00:49:03,093
<b>Who told you about that?</b>

772
00:49:04,094 --> 00:49:05,136
<b>I know I have just met you,</b>

773
00:49:05,845 --> 00:49:07,889
<b>but what exactly is the relationship
between you and Lieutenant Jeong?</b>

774
00:49:07,972 --> 00:49:09,307
<b>The relationship between
Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny?</b>

775
00:49:10,683 --> 00:49:12,268
<b>The relationship between two and three?</b>

776
00:49:12,352 --> 00:49:14,062
<b>The relationship between
Hongdae and Kondae?</b>

777
00:49:16,856 --> 00:49:18,066
<b>So it's not close.</b>

778
00:49:18,149 --> 00:49:20,735
<b>But I like both places.</b>

779
00:49:22,695 --> 00:49:24,906
<b>Why do you like them?
When they're so far away?</b>

780
00:49:24,989 --> 00:49:26,366
<b>Why are you taking his side?</b>

781
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:28,243
<b>Take whose side?</b>

782
00:49:29,035 --> 00:49:30,161
<b>What are we even talking about?</b>

783
00:49:30,370 --> 00:49:31,329
<b>You don't need to know.</b>

784
00:49:32,747 --> 00:49:34,582
<b>How can you be a detective
when you have no clue</b>

785
00:49:34,666 --> 00:49:35,792
<b>about how people feel?</b>

786
00:49:38,419 --> 00:49:39,295
<b>Just forget it.</b>

787
00:49:40,338 --> 00:49:41,631
<b>Let's go back to our daily life.</b>

788
00:49:42,924 --> 00:49:45,009
<b>I need to be comforted.</b>

789
00:49:45,593 --> 00:49:46,886
<b>So I will hold your hand.</b>

790
00:49:51,224 --> 00:49:52,475
<b>Let's not do this.</b>

791
00:49:53,226 --> 00:49:55,603
<b>We don't know
when we'll see each other again.</b>

792
00:50:10,869 --> 00:50:12,287
<b>Answer me without letting me go.</b>

793
00:50:12,537 --> 00:50:13,371
<b>I won't.</b>

794
00:50:14,622 --> 00:50:16,958
<b>I wanted to ask as soon as I saw you,
but I was holding back.</b>

795
00:50:18,126 --> 00:50:21,963
<b>I waited for you as a detective,
but also as myself all this time.</b>

796
00:50:28,845 --> 00:50:30,346
<b>Has something happened?</b>

797
00:50:31,431 --> 00:50:33,224
<b>Were you threatened by someone?</b>

798
00:50:36,352 --> 00:50:37,270
<b>I guess that means</b>

799
00:50:38,563 --> 00:50:39,606
<b>it will happen.</b>

800
00:50:41,983 --> 00:50:42,984
<b>That's why you came.</b>

801
00:50:44,444 --> 00:50:45,361
<b>What is it?</b>

802
00:50:47,989 --> 00:50:49,240
<b>Is there</b>

803
00:50:50,033 --> 00:50:51,284
<b>a dome stadium</b>

804
00:50:52,285 --> 00:50:54,412
<b>named K Stadium

805
00:50:55,830 --> 00:50:57,582
<b>With 16,890 seats?</b>

806
00:50:58,791 --> 00:50:59,918
<b>How do you know that?</b>

807
00:51:01,002 --> 00:51:02,128
<b>Did you look that up too?</b>

808
00:51:05,965 --> 00:51:06,841
<b>We're screwed.</b>

809
00:51:11,596 --> 00:51:13,139
<b>Give this to Director Hwang
of the care center.</b>

810
00:51:13,223 --> 00:51:14,641
<b>It's this month's electricity fees.</b>

811
00:51:17,685 --> 00:51:19,604
<b>Why are you giving him money
two days in advance?</b>

812
00:51:20,188 --> 00:51:21,564
<b>He'll take it for granted soon.</b>

813
00:51:24,817 --> 00:51:25,735
<b>Are you going to the other world again?</b>

814
00:51:25,818 --> 00:51:27,237
<b>I do everything in advance,</b>

815
00:51:27,779 --> 00:51:30,448
<b>but I won't bring the man with your face
too quickly, so don't worry.</b>

816

<b>You can never be sure

<b>Yes, it's news from my world.</b>

<b>But you found it here?</b>

<b>Who else knows about this?</b>

827
00:52:13,992 --> 00:52:15,076
<b>Just me for now.</b>

828
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:18,788
<b>I can't really tell anyone about this.
Nobody will believe it anyway.</b>

<b>What are you thinking of doing?</b>

830
00:52:21,666 --> 00:52:22,875
<b>I need to investigate further.</b>

831
00:52:23,543 --> 00:52:25,420
<b>This was my case</b>

832
00:52:26,504 --> 00:52:27,588
<b>before I even met you.</b>

833
00:52:29,465 --> 00:52:31,634
<b>It could be more dangerous than you think.</b>

834

<b>That's why I thought about

<b>But</b>

836
00:52:39,475 --> 00:52:42,270
<b>if I cover it up,
then no one will ever find out about this</b>

837
00:52:44,314 --> 00:52:47,317

<b>Me</b>

839

840
00:52:52,947 --> 00:52:54,991
<b>The two worlds

<b>They're supposed to stay

842

<b>But</b>

<b>So what else could I do?
I decided to investigate.</b>

846

<b>I'm a police officer

<b>So tell me anything you know about this.</b>

848
00:53:22,477 --> 00:53:24,771
<b>This is a cooperative investigation

<b>And the order of command?</b>

<b>I'm your superior, of course.</b>

<b>You've been carrying this around?</b>

<b>You're carrying lots of stuff around.</b>

<b>If he's alive, he'll be 69 right now.</b>

857
00:54:09,607 --> 00:54:12,235
<b>You should find someone who matches
his age, blood type, and fingerprints.</b>

858
00:54:13,277 --> 00:54:15,988
<b>In my world, his body was found

859
00:54:16,823 --> 00:54:17,740
<b>But the body</b>

860
00:54:19,033 --> 00:54:20,118
<b>was someone else's.</b>

861
00:54:21,202 --> 00:54:22,412
<b>If Lee Lim is alive...</b>

862
00:54:25,456 --> 00:54:26,791
<b>He's here</b>

863
00:54:28,251 --> 00:54:29,669
<b>using that body's identity.</b>

864
00:54:29,752 --> 00:54:30,837
<b>That's right.</b>

865
00:54:32,171 --> 00:54:36,676
<b>We have to figure out what

00:54:40,138 --> 00:54:41,055
<b>I'll look into it.</b>

<b>But until I find something,
do just 17 things.</b>

868
00:54:46,561 --> 00:54:47,728
<b>Stay quiet,</b>

869
00:54:48,104 --> 00:54:51,232
<b>don't draw people's attention,

<b>I'll do as you order.</b>

874
00:55:06,747 --> 00:55:08,458
<b>Do just two things for me.</b>

875
00:55:10,626 --> 00:55:12,170
<b>Don't tell me not to come,</b>

876
00:55:13,045 --> 00:55:14,046
<b>and don't tell me</b>

877
00:55:15,131 --> 00:55:16,007
<b>not to leave.</b>

878

<b>I have to go back sometimes,

<b>Whichever it is,</b>

880
00:55:25,266 --> 00:55:26,726
<b>if you tell me not to come or leave,</b>

881
00:55:27,810 --> 00:55:29,479
<b>I don't think I'll be able to do anything.</b>

882
00:55:33,649 --> 00:55:34,609
<b>So</b>

883
00:55:36,319 --> 00:55:38,321
<b>I'm asking you not to get exhausted.</b>

884
00:55:44,202 --> 00:55:45,244
<b>I feel like a lousy man</b>

885
00:55:46,954 --> 00:55:48,539
<b>after saying that.</b>

886
00:55:50,124 --> 00:55:51,292
<b>Am I?</b>

887
00:55:56,255 --> 00:56:00,635
<b>I'm confused about which part

888
00:56:04,263 --> 00:56:05,306
<b>You should go now.</b>

889
00:56:05,765 --> 00:56:07,183
<b>Yeong will be waiting for you.</b>

890
00:56:07,517 --> 00:56:09,519
<b>He'll be anxious
since he doesn't know where you are.</b>

891
00:56:09,936 --> 00:56:12,104
<b>Why would you think Yeong
doesn't know where I am?</b>

892
00:56:16,108 --> 00:56:18,319
<b>He's following us around here too?</b>

893
00:56:19,195 --> 00:56:20,696
<b>I guess I've made you curious.</b>

894
00:56:21,864 --> 00:56:22,865
<b>I'll be off now.</b>

895
00:56:24,242 --> 00:56:25,117
<b>There's something else</b>

896
00:56:27,036 --> 00:56:28,496
<b>I'm curious about.</b>

897
00:56:30,122 --> 00:56:31,958
<b>Am I really not in your world?</b>

00:56:40,883 --> 00:56:42,051
<b>Do I really not exist there?</b>

902
00:56:48,724 --> 00:56:49,725
<b>I do, don't I?</b>

903
00:56:59,652 --> 00:57:01,487
<b>How is it sleeping in the night duty room?</b>

<b>My wages are garnished, right?</b>

905
00:57:07,952 --> 00:57:10,580
<b>Come on, don't say it like that.</b>

906
00:57:10,913 --> 00:57:13,124
<b>There's an official term for that.</b>

907

<b>Seizure.</b>

908
00:57:16,419 --> 00:57:17,461
<b>I'll get it handled soon.</b>

909
00:57:18,254 --> 00:57:20,923
<b>The night duty room smells nice.
It's good.</b>

910
00:57:22,091 --> 00:57:23,426
<b>Of course, it does.</b>

911
00:57:23,926 --> 00:57:26,637
<b>Jangmi handed out questionnaires

912
00:57:27,096 --> 00:57:29,765
<b>It took three whole days

<b>Next time,</b>

<b>Do you still like snow at your age?</b>

919

<b>Well, it's not snowing much this year.</b>

922

<b>Hey, the beef is burning.</b>

923
00:58:11,349 --> 00:58:14,435

01:10:38,804 --> 01:10:40,389
<i><b>You have to catch him.</i></b>

1079
01:10:40,972 --> 01:10:43,225
<b>Get the money ready.
The bills with the King's face.</b>

1080
01:10:43,350 --> 01:10:44,643
<i><b>What happened?</i></b>

1081
01:10:45,018 --> 01:10:47,187
<i><b>So he first killed himself
and then killed me.</i></b>

1082
01:10:47,270 --> 01:10:49,940
<i><b>You're a miracle to me.</i></b>

1083
01:10:50,023 --> 01:10:51,483
<i><b>I saw something weird on it.</i></b>

1084
01:10:53,026 --> 01:10:54,569
<i><b>Jang Yeon-ji has two cell phones?</i></b>

1085
01:10:54,653 --> 01:10:56,655
<i><b>I can switch it off and on
whenever it's necessary.</i></b>

1086
01:10:56,738 --> 01:10:59,074
<b>You must be one of those
who stood on my father's blood.</b>

1087
01:10:59,157 --> 01:11:00,992
<b>Will I be able to catch up with you?</b>

1088
01:11:01,493 --> 01:11:03,245
<b>Hands off unless you want to die.</b>

1089
01:11:03,328 --> 01:11:05,414
<i><b>Do I exist in this world?</i></b>
