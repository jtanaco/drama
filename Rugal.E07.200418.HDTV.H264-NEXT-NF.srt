<b>Please don't kill us.

<b>All those people are actually victims.</b>

42
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,929
<b>It's so upsetting that we can't catch

<b>We can't say

<b>They're all from powerful families.</b>

45

<b>They touched the political slush funds
their parents were delivering.</b>

46
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:53,191
<b>And that's why they needed
to be forgiven by Chairman Hyeon.</b>

47
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:54,650
<b>It's all for show.</b>

48
00:03:55,526 --> 00:03:57,820
<b>Detective Yang is just pretending too.</b>

49
00:03:58,279 --> 00:04:00,406
<b>So what, then? Is this it?</b>

50

<b>The higher-ups want us to let them go.</b>

51
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:05,286
<b>It's odd that a tycoon</b>

52
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,747
<b>like AH Group's Chairman Hyeon
admitted he's behind this.</b>

53
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:10,708
<b>And why did he request police protection
when he ordered them to do this?</b>

54
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:12,085
<b>Odd, right?</b>

55
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:14,045
<b>It doesn't make sense.</b>

56
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:17,090
<b>If you take Chairman Hyeon
out of the equation,</b>

57
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:19,008
<b>it actually makes more sense.</b>

58
00:04:19,258 --> 00:04:22,011
<b>A mysterious third party did this</b>

59
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:24,138
<b>and pinned it on Chairman Hyeon,</b>

60
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:25,932
<b>so he got all angry.</b>

61
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:27,975
<b>Then he realized
that the police can't handle this,</b>

62
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:30,686
<b>so he rushed to get us involved.</b>

63
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:47,912
<b>He won't even get any credit for this.</b>

64
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:49,664
<b>He's doing all the work for nothing.</b>

65
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:53,334
<b>I feel so useless
because there's nothing we can do.</b>

71

85
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:45,840

<b>I think Mi-na saw the car.

99
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:35,908

<b>Can you explain this to me?</b>

155
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:39,795
<b>Hwang Deuk-gu and Choi Ye-won
did this together.</b>

156
00:14:39,878 --> 00:14:42,047
<b>They drowned the leader of Argos</b>

157
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:44,633
<b>at the execution site they built.</b>

158
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:47,011
<b>But what they didn't take
into consideration</b>

159
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:50,639
<b>is the fact that the divers
are just as greedy as they are.</b>

160
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:55,853
<b><i>To the divers, Ko Yong-deok
wasn't just a dead body they had to lift.</i></b>

161
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:58,147
<b><i>They saw it as a chance
to turn their lives around.</i></b>

162
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:01,734
<b>-One, two, three.
-<i>Life never turns out the way you want.</i></b>

163
00:15:02,317 --> 00:15:04,153
<b><i>They knew they'd be blamed for it,</i></b>

164
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:05,904
<b><i>so they couldn't tell the higher-ups.</i></b>

165
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:07,531
<b>One, two, three!</b>

166
00:15:07,614 --> 00:15:10,784
<b>However, they couldn't kill him because
they thought he'd be useful later on.</b>

167
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:16,081
<b>Where are the divers?
Did you take care of them?</b>

168
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:18,667
<b>You don't need to worry.</b>

169
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:22,713
<b>Then now, it's my turn.</b>

170
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:25,591
<b>Good work. Go home and get some rest.</b>

171
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:28,177
<b>But you won't be able
to communicate with him.</b>

172
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,511
<b>Communicate with him?</b>

173
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:33,474
<b>-I'm just going to extract stuff from him.
-Shall I do it?</b>

174
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:36,018
<b>I can extract whatever you need.</b>

175
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:38,187
<b>No, it's okay.</b>

176
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:43,358
<b>Susan, it's dangerous.
You might get hurt. You might...</b>

177
00:15:56,705 --> 00:15:59,041
<b>No way. Will Susan...</b>

178
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:00,459
<b>You guys shouldn't see this</b>

179
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:03,170
<b>so that you can avoid
being held responsible.</b>

180
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,132
<b>Let's go.</b>

181
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:09,259
<b>But...</b>

182
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:30,823
<b>They didn't just take care of the corpses.</b>

183
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:32,324
<b>Then what else?</b>

184
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:35,244
<b>They told the victims' watches,
cell phones, and jewelry.</b>

185
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:38,831
<b>They even sold organs.</b>

186
00:16:39,414 --> 00:16:40,833
<b><i>As people say, old habits die hard.</i></b>

187
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:43,836
<b><i>They even sold
Ko Yong-deok's wedding presents.</i></b>

188
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:46,130
<b>They're actually pretty well-known
on resale websites.</b>

189
00:16:46,713 --> 00:16:49,591
<b>I see comments vouching for the quality
and their after-sales service.</b>

190
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,635
<b>They're unbelievable.</b>

191
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:56,223
<b>Thanks to them, Hwang Deuk-gu
got blindsided by someone he trusted.</b>

192
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:57,766
<b>That serves him right.</b>

193
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,269
<b>These jerks have been taking advantage
of those evil bastards.</b>

194
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:02,437
<b>I bet Ko Yong-deok regrets
coming back to life.</b>

195
00:17:03,021 --> 00:17:04,523
<b>He obviously didn't know</b>

196
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:07,317
<b>that he'd become the prey
in the ecosystem that he built.</b>

197
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:09,945
<b>He's alive,
so they're guilty of attempted murder.</b>

198
00:17:10,028 --> 00:17:12,573
<b>If we manage to get a statement
from Ko Yong-deok,</b>

199
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:15,659
<b>we should be able to put both Choi Ye-won
and Hwang Deuk-gu behind bars.</b>

200
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:19,663
<b>That will be great, but why do I feel like
this is too easy to be true?</b>

201
00:17:20,455 --> 00:17:22,583
<b>I should've killed Hwang Deuk-gu first.</b>

202
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:24,501
<b>Why didn't you kill him?</b>

203
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:26,837
<b>I obviously wanted to.</b>

204
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,505
<b>I guess that was enough</b>

205
00:17:30,465 --> 00:17:31,300
<b>to get your revenge.</b>

206
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:34,720
<b>I was told to capture him alive
and not kill him.</b>

207
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,681
<b>-What was I supposed to do?
-What I'm saying is,</b>

208
00:17:37,764 --> 00:17:40,100
<b>what you did
isn't a true representation of Rugal.</b>

209
00:17:41,768 --> 00:17:44,855
<b>But thanks to your decision,
we could abide by our rules.</b>

210
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:48,942
<b>Let me ask you something
since you keep talking about rules.</b>

211
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:52,654
<b>Let's say I killed him.
Then who will take responsibility for it?</b>

212
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,781
<b>Will you go to jail with me?</b>

213
00:17:56,658 --> 00:18:00,245
<b>I'll take responsibility
for anything Rugal does.</b>

214
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:04,875
<b>Even if that entails
something a lot worse than going to jail.</b>

215
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:49,294
<b>Hwang Deuk-gu! Choi Ye-won!</b>

216
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,421
<b>I'll teach you a lesson--</b>

217
00:18:57,594 --> 00:18:59,513
<b>Do you feel alive now?</b>

218
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:01,306
<b>You bastard.</b>

219
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:03,684
<b>Do you know who I am?</b>

220
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:06,311
<b>I'm Ko Yong-deok.</b>

221
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:08,939
<b>One vial keeps you awake for five minutes,</b>

222
00:19:10,148 --> 00:19:13,277
<b>but you lose a year of your life
every time you get a shot of this.</b>

223
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:15,404
<b>I don't think you have time to whine.</b>

224
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:17,322
<b>What is it that you want?</b>

225
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:20,075
<b>We might have similar goals.</b>

226
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:24,663
<b>I'll let you take Hwang Deuk-gu.</b>

227
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:27,082
<b>If you want to get your revenge,</b>

228
00:19:27,165 --> 00:19:30,585
<b>you'll have to tell me
everything you know.</b>

229
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:55,110
<b><i>Your anger level
is in the dangerous range.</i></b>

230
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:57,279
<b><i>You must relieve your anger.</i></b>

231
00:19:58,447 --> 00:19:59,781
<b>Thanks for bringing that up.</b>

232
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:02,117
<b>Had you not stopped me...</b>

233
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,827
<b>-<i>I never did.</i>
-What?</b>

234
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:06,580
<b><i>All I do is tell you
the results of my analyses.</i></b>

235
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:12,085
<b>-So what's your opinion?
-<i>You want to hear my opinion?</i></b>

236
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:15,464
<b>Forget it.
It's no use talking about it now.</b>

237
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:19,926
<b><i>I suggest you eat vitamin-rich fresh fruit
for your mental health.</i></b>

238
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:22,721
<b><i>Doing a handstand before bed
will be helpful as well.</i></b>

239
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:24,931
<b>I have to eat fruit this late? Forget it.</b>

240
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,235
<b>We should kill Hwang Deuk-gu first.</b>

241
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:40,489
<b>You wanted to cook up a scheme.
I guess you had a change of heart?</b>

242
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:42,407
<b><i>The situation must be changing rapidly.</i></b>

243
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:44,409
<b>The order changed, but that's all.</b>

244
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:46,953
<b>That position sounds very stressful.</b>

245
00:20:47,704 --> 00:20:48,997
<b>You must be anxious at all times.</b>

246
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:53,126
<b>In conclusion, you killed him.
I know nothing about it.</b>

247
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:55,170
<b>Sure, whatever.</b>

248
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:57,005
<b>But I decide how it'll be done.</b>

249
00:20:57,172 --> 00:20:58,632
<b><i>Let's discuss the details in person. </i></b>

250
00:20:58,715 --> 00:21:01,093
<b>I'll call you
when I have the location and time.</b>

251
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:09,142
<b>D-Day, all of a sudden?</b>

252
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:34,084
<b>Forgive me for the sake of our friendship.</b>

253
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:36,169
<b>A gift? After what you did?</b>

254
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:38,505
<b>It's not like we'll never see each other.</b>

255
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:41,425
<b>And I never come empty-handed
whenever I see you.</b>

256
00:21:53,937 --> 00:21:58,984
<b>But whether you buy that gallery or not,
you can't go up against Hwang Deuk-gu</b>

257
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:00,735
<b>with the little bit of money
you embezzled.</b>

258
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:04,322
<b>It all depends on how I stage it,
as long as I have a reason to kill him.</b>

259
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:06,491
<b>That's true.</b>

260
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:08,994
<b>I can't believe it though.</b>

261
00:22:09,077 --> 00:22:12,747
<b>What did Hwang Deuk-gu do to Seol Min-jun
to turn him into his loyal dog?</b>

262
00:22:13,373 --> 00:22:15,208
<b>That I don't know.</b>

263
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:29,764
<b><i>But if it's Hwang Deuk-gu...</i></b>

264
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:32,434
<b>It's not so surprising.</b>

265
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:33,685
<b>Right.</b>

266
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:37,481
<b>The old farts are scared shitless too.</b>

267
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:41,067
<b>Choi Yong and Bong Man-cheol
said they'd help too.</b>

268
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:42,611
<b>Seriously?</b>

269
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:44,654
<b>Those stiff old farts?</b>

270
00:22:45,822 --> 00:22:47,824
<b>They need to turn things around
quickly as well.</b>

271
00:22:48,241 --> 00:22:51,786
<b>And you become tenderhearted
when you're old and sick.</b>

272
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:54,539
<b>But you also</b>

273
00:22:55,582 --> 00:22:56,750
<b>had to lower yourself.</b>

274
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:59,794
<b>I think Hwang Deuk-gu got
on Chairman Hyeon's nerves.</b>

275
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:02,380
<b>If I can make him feel better</b>

276
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:05,634
<b>and end the power struggles
once and for all,</b>

277
00:23:06,968 --> 00:23:08,678
<b>putting my ego aside isn't a big deal.</b>

278
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:15,810
<b>Him being the vice-chairman,</b>

279
00:23:16,436 --> 00:23:19,523
<b>I'd like the actions to be somewhat grand.</b>

280
00:23:19,856 --> 00:23:21,608
<b>What do you have in mind?</b>

281
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:24,945
<b>I'd like to test the waters,</b>

282
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:27,656
<b>but I haven't seen him around lately.</b>

283
00:23:28,615 --> 00:23:30,158
<b>Could he have caught on?</b>

284
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:50,637
<b>Weren't you taking a break?</b>

285
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:52,806
<b>I get it.</b>

286
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:57,310
<b>Physically activity clears the mind
when it comes to people like us.</b>

287
00:23:58,895 --> 00:24:00,939
<b>Come on. Let me help you with that.</b>

288
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:34,180
<b>How about another round?</b>

289
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,099
<b>I'm good for many.</b>

290
00:24:36,683 --> 00:24:38,810
<b>Wearing yourself out
won't solve your problems though.</b>

291
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:41,062
<b>Have we been doing a good job?</b>

292
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:45,734
<b>-Of course.
-Then why is it</b>

293
00:24:46,943 --> 00:24:50,238
<b>that I can only remember
their gruesome crimes?</b>

294
00:24:54,909 --> 00:24:56,661
<b>I feel like we're losing.</b>

295
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:00,290
<b>Then we'll find a way to win.</b>

296
00:25:00,373 --> 00:25:03,543
<b>Forget about approvals and justifications.</b>

297
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:07,005
<b>We need something
that'll turn the tables around.</b>

298
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:15,805
<b>Can anyone guess
what I have in this envelope?</b>

299
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:17,807
<b>-Money!
-No, that's not the case.</b>

300
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:21,269
<b>In this envelope are gift vouchers</b>

301

<b>that you can use to consume products
and services provided by Argos.</b>

302
00:25:24,814 --> 00:25:26,399
<b>I see you couldn't trust me.</b>

303
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,277
<b>Let's now welcome Chairwoman Choi Ye-won.</b>

304
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:32,906
<b>Ms. Choi will personally drop
the envelope in the letterbox.</b>

305
00:25:33,114 --> 00:25:35,241
<b>One, two, three.</b>

306
00:25:36,117 --> 00:25:37,744
<b>Please give her a big round of applause!</b>

307
00:25:37,827 --> 00:25:41,623
<b>Envelopes like this will be delivered
to 5,000 disadvantaged families.</b>

308
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:45,168
<b>Please give Ms. Choi
another big round of applause.</b>

309
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:51,424
<b>Next, we'll begin the raffle.
We have many prizes ready today.</b>

310
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:55,303
<b>Green tea, potatoes, and kiwi!</b>

311
00:25:58,056 --> 00:26:00,433
<b>Let's now begin the raffle!</b>

312
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:04,604
<b>-Make it seem like you're guarding me.
-Would you like a box of kiwi?</b>

313
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:05,563
<b>-Yes!
-Yes!</b>

314
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:10,735
<b>What an angel you are.</b>

315
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:13,321
<b>We also do good in this world, you know.</b>

316
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:15,907
<b>Before you speak shit of our blank money,</b>

317
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:19,327
<b>I dare you to take away the envelopes
from the kids who'll receive them.</b>

318
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:22,205
<b>I doubt you called me over to boast.</b>

319
00:26:24,165 --> 00:26:26,918
<b>I'm the only one in the organization
interested in charity.</b>

320
00:26:28,044 --> 00:26:31,756
<b>It's good in a way
since no one bothers to interfere.</b>

321
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:36,344
<b>No one suspects anything either
because I've been at this for a while.</b>

322
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:39,764
<b>It's a smart move.</b>

323
00:26:41,182 --> 00:26:42,934
<b>Why don't we take a walk elsewhere?</b>

324
00:26:48,751 --> 00:26:51,170
<b>It's been a while since I've walked</b>

325
00:26:51,921 --> 00:26:53,214
<b>among a crowd.</b>

326
00:26:54,298 --> 00:26:56,675
<b>I didn't know we were close enough
to share such information.</b>

327
00:26:57,218 --> 00:26:59,553
<b>There were men earlier
eyeing my every move.</b>

328
00:26:59,637 --> 00:27:03,265
<b>I should take precautions
considering I hardly know you.</b>

329
00:27:04,725 --> 00:27:07,269
<b>Well, I'm the type to perform better
under pressure.</b>

330
00:27:08,312 --> 00:27:11,232
<b>Soon I will throw a party
with all the middle bosses.</b>

331
00:27:11,315 --> 00:27:12,817
<b>Hwang Deuk-gu will be there, too.</b>

332
00:27:14,318 --> 00:27:16,153
<b>-The venue?
-My residence.</b>

333
00:27:16,987 --> 00:27:19,782
<b>No one will raise questions
since it's where we normally gathered.</b>

334
00:27:21,617 --> 00:27:24,370
<b>So big names
will be gathered in one place.</b>

335
00:27:25,204 --> 00:27:27,957
<b>-Talk about a top-security event.
-Of course.</b>

336
00:27:30,126 --> 00:27:31,877
<b>A mistake will lead to your death.</b>

337
00:27:32,336 --> 00:27:33,504
<b>Your concern isn't necessary.</b>

338
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:36,841
<b>It's pretty here.</b>

339
00:27:38,008 --> 00:27:38,884
<b>Enjoy the view.</b>

340
00:28:23,888 --> 00:28:26,974
<b><i>Enjoy the night view and
fit me in for a consult tomorrow morning.</i></b>

341
00:28:27,683 --> 00:28:29,226
<b><i>I found the perfect place.</i></b>

342
00:28:36,859 --> 00:28:37,776
<b>You're here.</b>

343
00:28:38,027 --> 00:28:38,903
<b>Hi.</b>

344
00:28:43,199 --> 00:28:45,784
<b>Why did you call me here this morning?</b>

345
00:28:47,119 --> 00:28:47,995
<b>So what's this about?</b>

346
00:28:49,955 --> 00:28:53,417
<b>I wanted to clear my head
and apologize to you.</b>

347
00:28:54,126 --> 00:28:55,419
<b>Apologize for what?</b>

348
00:28:56,629 --> 00:28:57,880
<b>Well,</b>

349
00:28:58,464 --> 00:29:00,341
<b>you and I keep clashing.</b>

350
00:29:01,342 --> 00:29:03,219
<b>We may have the same goal,</b>

351
00:29:03,302 --> 00:29:07,181
<b>but I'm sure it hasn't been easy for you
because of one certain teammate.</b>

352
00:29:08,724 --> 00:29:09,892
<b>I guess you can say that.</b>

353
00:29:11,769 --> 00:29:14,230
<b>But was it necessary to ask me out here</b>

354
00:29:15,522 --> 00:29:16,690
<b>just to tell me that?</b>

355
00:29:17,274 --> 00:29:18,651
<b>What do you really want to say?</b>

356
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:22,238
<b>I've been trying hard not to address this,
but it's easier said than done.</b>

357
00:29:22,321 --> 00:29:23,572
<b>What is?</b>

358
00:29:25,366 --> 00:29:26,575
<b>Ms. Han Tae-yeon.</b>

359
00:29:27,451 --> 00:29:28,869
<b>In order to save her brother,</b>

360
00:29:28,994 --> 00:29:31,580
<b>she bet everything she had
on one detective.</b>

361
00:29:32,122 --> 00:29:34,291
<b>I couldn't help her in any way though.</b>

362
00:29:35,334 --> 00:29:39,088
<b>I'm even partially responsible
for you losing your arm.</b>

363
00:29:41,298 --> 00:29:44,176
<b>You must've known,
so why didn't you say anything?</b>

364
00:29:44,468 --> 00:29:45,469
<b>You</b>

365
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:47,137
<b>did your job</b>

366
00:29:48,514 --> 00:29:50,975
<b>while I only did mine.</b>

367
00:29:52,351 --> 00:29:54,228
<b>I don't want to be
at wits' end thinking about</b>

368
00:29:55,062 --> 00:29:56,313
<b>what couldn't have been helped.</b>

369
00:29:56,897 --> 00:30:00,484
<b>You never bring your personal emotions
to the office, do you?</b>

370
00:30:02,403 --> 00:30:04,321
<b>The outcome wouldn't have changed</b>

371
00:30:05,406 --> 00:30:07,866
<b>-no matter who had taken the case.
-But I</b>

372
00:30:09,576 --> 00:30:10,786
<b>feel sorry</b>

373
00:30:11,954 --> 00:30:13,247
<b>and of course awful.</b>

374
00:30:16,292 --> 00:30:18,377
<b>If only we all face the same direction.</b>

375
00:30:19,545 --> 00:30:22,256
<b>Then no one would have to get hurt.</b>

376
00:30:23,966 --> 00:30:24,967
<b>Probably.</b>

377
00:30:29,096 --> 00:30:30,848
<b>What's with the sudden training session?</b>

378
00:30:31,515 --> 00:30:32,391
<b>Beats me.</b>

379
00:30:32,599 --> 00:30:35,311
<b>Gi-beom will bite our heads off
if we don't show or are late.</b>

380
00:30:37,229 --> 00:30:38,105
<b>Oh...</b>

381
00:30:39,565 --> 00:30:41,442
<b>-Did you receive this text too?
-Yes.</b>

382
00:30:42,651 --> 00:30:45,404
<b>He probably has something to say
but your guess is as good as mine.</b>

383
00:30:49,033 --> 00:30:50,868
<b>There. I see Gi-beom and Tae-woong.</b>

384
00:30:58,876 --> 00:31:01,128
<b>How about a run to get the blood flowing?</b>

385
00:31:02,046 --> 00:31:03,922
<b>Why waste a fine day by the water?</b>

386
00:31:05,883 --> 00:31:08,635
<b>Can I believe that your priority
lies with Rugal then?</b>

387
00:31:09,762 --> 00:31:10,637
<b>That's right.</b>

388
00:31:11,555 --> 00:31:14,141
<b>The make sure you protect it
until the very end.</b>

389
00:31:15,184 --> 00:31:16,060
<b>Of course.</b>

390
00:31:18,771 --> 00:31:19,980
<b>What's taking you so long?</b>

391
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:21,690
<b>Coming!</b>

392
00:31:23,108 --> 00:31:24,109
<b>Did you tell them to come?</b>

393
00:31:24,777 --> 00:31:26,111
<b>Coming!</b>

394
00:31:26,195 --> 00:31:28,781
<b>Why aren't you running at top speed?</b>

395
00:31:29,281 --> 00:31:30,282
<b>Stop slacking off.</b>

396
00:31:31,325 --> 00:31:33,202
<b>We haven't trained together in a while.</b>

397
00:31:33,369 --> 00:31:34,995
<b>Let's make the most of it then.</b>

398
00:31:35,537 --> 00:31:37,581
<b>I'm all warmed up, so let's do this.</b>

399
00:31:37,664 --> 00:31:39,500
<b>-Let's go.
-Let's do this.</b>

400
00:32:02,564 --> 00:32:05,234
<b>The dead skin on your body
has been removed.</b>

401
00:32:05,317 --> 00:32:07,569
<b>It has been replaced by artificial flesh.</b>

402
00:32:07,653 --> 00:32:09,113
<b>And everywhere else?</b>

403
00:32:09,321 --> 00:32:11,949
<b>Fortunately, your organs were unscathed.</b>

404
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:15,619
<b>You might've not made it
had you come back too late.</b>

405
00:32:17,996 --> 00:32:19,456
<b>Of course. You're a doctor, right?</b>

406
00:32:20,666 --> 00:32:23,877
<b>All the cutting and sawing you do
made you seem like a butcher.</b>

407
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:26,547
<b>And also,</b>

408
00:32:26,964 --> 00:32:30,509
<b>if what you're hoping for</b>

409
00:32:30,968 --> 00:32:35,597
<b>is a device
that can outsmart a human being--</b>

410
00:32:35,681 --> 00:32:38,267
<b>-We have to move up the plan.
-Sorry?</b>

411
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:40,769
<b>I'll provide you with anything you need,</b>

412
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,980
<b>so make it happen this time.</b>

413
00:32:43,772 --> 00:32:44,648
<b>Yes, sir.</b>

414
00:32:48,193 --> 00:32:49,570
<b>CHOI YE-WON</b>

415
00:32:50,654 --> 00:32:54,825
<b>Let me start by
cleaning out my house first.</b>

416
00:32:55,868 --> 00:32:57,995
<b>-Does this hurt?
-No.</b>

417
00:32:59,872 --> 00:33:01,165
<b>Then...</b>

418
00:33:03,083 --> 00:33:04,960
<b>That hurts!</b>

419
00:33:05,544 --> 00:33:06,587
<b>Really?</b>

420
00:33:07,463 --> 00:33:09,590
<b>Maybe the wires
weren't connected properly.</b>

421
00:33:10,924 --> 00:33:14,178
<b>Hey, be grateful for this though.</b>

422
00:33:14,303 --> 00:33:16,430
<b>Susan would've been way worse.</b>

423
00:33:16,513 --> 00:33:17,973
<b>-What?
-Jeez,</b>

424
00:33:18,056 --> 00:33:20,434
<b>you're clueless, aren't you?</b>

425
00:33:20,976 --> 00:33:26,023
<b>Gwang-cheol, the devil lives among us!</b>

426
00:33:26,106 --> 00:33:27,483
<b>What? The devil?</b>

427
00:33:27,566 --> 00:33:28,442
<b>That's right.</b>

428
00:33:29,401 --> 00:33:30,277
<b>Don't be ridiculous.</b>

429
00:33:30,861 --> 00:33:32,321
<b>Isn't it weird</b>

430
00:33:32,404 --> 00:33:35,365
<b>how the chief chose Susan over the others</b>

431
00:33:35,449 --> 00:33:38,452
<b>to accompany him at the solitary cell?</b>

432
00:33:38,702 --> 00:33:39,620
<b>You're right.</b>

433
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,538
<b>That is weird.</b>

434
00:33:41,622 --> 00:33:43,707
<b>She's a sweetheart,</b>

435
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:46,126
<b>so I'd think she'd scream in fear.</b>

436
00:33:46,210 --> 00:33:49,046
<b>Don't say that when you know nothing!</b>

437
00:33:50,339 --> 00:33:51,423
<b>Ko Yong-deok</b>

438
00:33:52,424 --> 00:33:54,843
<b>will end up spilling the beans.</b>

439
00:33:54,927 --> 00:33:56,637
<b>It won't be easy.</b>

440
00:33:57,054 --> 00:33:59,139
<b>The man once led a crime organization.</b>

441
00:33:59,723 --> 00:34:01,850
<b>But I've seen her at work.</b>

442
00:34:03,227 --> 00:34:06,522
<b>She cuts, saws, combines,
and assembles people</b>

443
00:34:06,605 --> 00:34:08,315
<b>as if they're toys.</b>

444
00:34:08,398 --> 00:34:10,609
<b>The blood is just too gruesome.</b>

445
00:34:11,443 --> 00:34:13,654
<b>You have no idea
since you were anesthetized.</b>

446
00:34:14,571 --> 00:34:15,739
<b>But I've seen it all.</b>

447
00:34:16,573 --> 00:34:19,993
<b>Her face carried a blank expression,
but she was enjoying it--</b>

448
00:34:21,503 --> 00:34:22,838
<b>Oh, right.</b>

449
00:34:22,921 --> 00:34:25,465
<b>Hi, Susan.</b>

450
00:34:51,191 --> 00:34:52,943
<b>Yes, right here.</b>

451
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:55,279
<b>Thanks, Bradley. That feels better.</b>

452

<b>-Can you double-check?
-Right here.</b>

453
00:35:02,494 --> 00:35:03,620
<b>Right...</b>

454
00:35:06,957 --> 00:35:08,834
<b>I'm scared!</b>

455
00:35:08,917 --> 00:35:11,003
<b>No, I'm terrified!</b>

456
00:35:22,139 --> 00:35:23,849
<b>Sir, you asked for me?</b>

457
00:35:25,142 --> 00:35:26,977
<b>Are you all right, sir?</b>

458
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:28,770
<b>And here I thought you'd never show up.</b>

459
00:35:29,771 --> 00:35:32,649
<b>So what has Hwang been up to lately?</b>

460
00:35:33,317 --> 00:35:35,277
<b>We've been wanting to see him,</b>

461
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:37,154
<b>but he's been off the grid.</b>

462
00:35:37,237 --> 00:35:40,449
<b>Mr. Hwang only keeps
Seol Min-jun by his side these days.</b>

463
00:35:40,532 --> 00:35:41,908
<b>We already heard.</b>

464
00:35:42,743 --> 00:35:44,077
<b>I won't accept silence,</b>

465
00:35:44,161 --> 00:35:45,454
<b>so at least give me something.</b>

466
00:35:46,038 --> 00:35:47,080
<b>Bring me Hwang Deuk-gu</b>

467
00:35:47,164 --> 00:35:49,333
<b>or it'll be over between you and me.</b>

468
00:35:49,416 --> 00:35:51,209
<b>Well, you see...</b>

469
00:35:59,176 --> 00:36:00,969
<b>Boss, you're here!</b>

470
00:36:14,399 --> 00:36:16,026
<b>I see you've been busy...</b>

471
00:36:16,943 --> 00:36:18,570
<b>behind my back.</b>

472
00:36:19,154 --> 00:36:20,197
<b>That's not the case.</b>

473
00:36:20,947 --> 00:36:23,492
<b>In your absence, I'm supposed to--</b>

474
00:36:29,956 --> 00:36:31,249
<b>I see that life goes on for you.</b>

475
00:36:32,542 --> 00:36:35,295
<b>You sure can hold a gaze
for someone who lost everything.</b>

476
00:36:35,379 --> 00:36:37,464
<b>What you took from me doesn't matter.</b>

477
00:36:38,048 --> 00:36:39,800
<b>Without Yong-deok,</b>

478
00:36:39,883 --> 00:36:42,219
<b>you won't be able to do anything
with that address.</b>

479
00:36:42,969 --> 00:36:43,804
<b>What do you mean?</b>

480
00:36:44,930 --> 00:36:47,391
<b>Who cares that you have a weapon</b>

481
00:36:47,641 --> 00:36:49,101
<b>when you don't know how to use it?</b>

482
00:36:50,811 --> 00:36:53,146
<b>You'll never be able to.</b>

483
00:36:55,023 --> 00:36:57,109
<b>Are you implying</b>

484
00:36:57,192 --> 00:36:59,611
<b>that you have
the late chairman hidden somewhere?</b>

485
00:36:59,695 --> 00:37:02,989
<b>If you're that curious,</b>

486
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:05,742
<b>go ahead and dig up his grave.</b>

487
00:37:10,497 --> 00:37:12,040
<b>If I must,</b>

488
00:37:13,333 --> 00:37:14,543
<b>then I will.</b>

489
00:37:15,252 --> 00:37:16,420
<b>What?</b>

490
00:37:34,062 --> 00:37:36,106
<b>What was that all about?</b>

491
00:37:36,189 --> 00:37:39,860
<b>Is there something
that only the two of you know?</b>

492
00:37:39,943 --> 00:37:42,738
<b>It's nothing you need to know,
so forget about it.</b>

493
00:37:58,670 --> 00:38:00,130
<b>Damn it.</b>

494
00:38:00,464 --> 00:38:01,590
<b>Shit.</b>

<b>Around the clock?</b>

<b>There's something only Choi Yong knows.</b>

<b>What do you know about Chairman Ko?</b>

<b>How do I know?</b>

<b>You being in the dark implies
that it's something important though.</b>

526
00:40:42,542 --> 00:40:44,169
<b>It's something big, right?</b>

527
00:40:46,963 --> 00:40:50,675
<b>It seems like he and Hwang Deuk-gu

<b>-Money?
-No, something more than that.</b>

529
00:40:53,845 --> 00:40:55,555
<b>It's something</b>

530
00:40:55,639 --> 00:40:59,017
<b>that could give him control of Argos

<b>Of course not.</b>

535
00:41:17,369 --> 00:41:19,746
<b>No wonder my feet naturally led me here.</b>

536
00:41:19,829 --> 00:41:21,414
<b>So what can I do to help?</b>

537
00:41:22,290 --> 00:41:25,251
<b>Ye-won seems to be making plans

<b>Sounds like we'll be able

00:41:51,361 --> 00:41:53,405
<b>Wait, what the hell?</b>

00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:02,080
<b>-Gi-beom.
-Yes?</b>

541
00:42:02,163 --> 00:42:04,165
<b>-Dr. Oh has been kidnapped.
-What?</b>

542
00:42:04,249 --> 00:42:06,501
<b>Are you sure
it's Director Gu of K Hospital?</b>

543
00:42:07,252 --> 00:42:09,170
<b><i>Yes, it most definitely is him.</i></b>

544
00:42:09,254 --> 00:42:10,547
<b>He called for help</b>

545
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:12,841
<b>and said he knew where Dr. Oh was taken.</b>

546
00:42:12,924 --> 00:42:15,301
<b>Are you saying Director Gu escaped?</b>

547
00:42:15,385 --> 00:42:17,971
<b>He said we needed to rescue him first</b>

548
00:42:18,054 --> 00:42:19,681
<b>since Dr. Oh won't have much time.</b>

549
00:42:19,764 --> 00:42:23,059
<b>I can't be sure of what's going on.</b>

550
00:42:24,144 --> 00:42:25,395
<b>I'll dispatch my men first,</b>

551
00:42:25,478 --> 00:42:28,982
<b>so assemble two teams and
set up a perimeter around the location.</b>

552
00:42:32,235 --> 00:42:36,156
<b>All we have at the moment
is Director Gu's intel.</b>

553
00:42:36,239 --> 00:42:39,200
<b>I doubt there's a security camera
in the parking lot of a closed hospital.</b>

554
00:42:40,035 --> 00:42:42,078
<b>Dr. Oh never installed
a GPS system or a dashcam</b>

555
00:42:42,162 --> 00:42:44,789
<b>in case it could lead anyone
back to headquarters.</b>

556
00:42:44,873 --> 00:42:46,041
<b>Bastards.</b>

557
00:42:46,124 --> 00:42:48,626
<b>How dare they kidnap Dr. Oh.</b>

558
00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:51,046
<b>Can Director Gu be trusted?</b>

559
00:42:51,129 --> 00:42:52,797
<b>We'll have to see for ourselves.</b>

560
00:42:53,923 --> 00:42:57,719
<b>Chief, the fact that
they know about Dr. Oh</b>

561
00:42:58,261 --> 00:42:59,888
<b>might be a danger to our organization.</b>

562
00:43:01,306 --> 00:43:05,727
<b>Exactly. It's why this operation
will shape the course of this war.</b>

563
00:43:05,810 --> 00:43:07,312
<b>You must rescue him.</b>

564
00:43:07,395 --> 00:43:08,521
<b>-Of course.
-Yes, sir.</b>

565
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:17,553
<b>Everybody, stop.</b>

566
00:43:18,221 --> 00:43:19,972
<b>Gi-beom, check our location.</b>

571
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:32,026
<b>Send a signal if you see anything.</b>

572

<b>Hold on. What about me?</b>

573
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:35,488
<b>There could be men hiding.</b>

<b>That's not what I meant.</b>

<b>It's dark and also quiet out here.</b>

580
00:43:48,835 --> 00:43:50,378
<b>Stay off the radio as much as possible</b>

581

582
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:54,215
<b>There's no time to waste, so move out.</b>

583
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:55,299
<b>Got it.</b>

584
00:44:11,774 --> 00:44:12,775

<b>-Are you injured?
-I'm fine.</b>

589
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:32,920
<b>I've been crouching down

591

<b>So where's Dr. Oh?</b>
