<b>You won't have those detectives
in front of your room anymore.</b>

3
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:22,745
<b>I told you already.
Everything is a misunderstanding.</b>

4
00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:24,539
<b>Do say hello...</b>

5
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:26,809
<b>to Detective Ji for me.</b>

6
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:29,410
<b>What about that guy?</b>

7
00:00:30,609 --> 00:00:33,410
<b>He told me everything.</b>

8
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:38,120
<b>That you were falsely blamed
for the last incident.</b>

9
00:00:40,049 --> 00:00:43,289
<b>That you were
deceived by that woman.</b>

10
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:46,090
<b>Ji Hyeong Ju said
something like that?</b>

11
00:00:46,359 --> 00:00:47,859
<b>And he apologized too.</b>

12
00:00:48,929 --> 00:00:50,700
<b>He said he was
also partially responsible.</b>

13
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:23,030
<b>What is this?</b>

14
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:27,870
<b>Hey, Mr. Detective.</b>

15
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:29,500
<b>Bae Jung Tae?</b>

16
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,409
<b>What is this photo?</b>

17
00:01:31,609 --> 00:01:34,439
<b>Let's talk more about it in person.</b>

18
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:37,049
<b>I can only imagine...</b>

19
00:01:37,349 --> 00:01:40,519
<b>how curious you must be
about that photo.</b>

20
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:45,189
<b>I sent it as a token
of my appreciation for your help,</b>

21
00:01:46,019 --> 00:01:47,920
<b>so come before I change my mind.</b>

22
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:49,790
<b>I'll be waiting for you.</b>

23
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,540
<b>What's this?</b>

24
00:02:07,609 --> 00:02:09,409
<b>He's early.</b>

25
00:02:11,209 --> 00:02:14,450
<b>He sure came early.</b>

26
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:31,430

<b>- You must be tired.
- Goodness.</b>

29
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:44,580
<b>It sure is like having a pick-me-up
to catch the culprit.</b>

30
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:47,490
<b>If it wasn't Bae Jung Tae,
it means we're back to ground zero.</b>

31
00:02:48,349 --> 00:02:51,289
<b>We don't even have a suspect now.
Where do we begin investigating?</b>

32
00:02:51,449 --> 00:02:54,319
<b>Let's stop thinking about this
and go catch a movie.</b>

33

<b>- Shall we?
- Should we?</b>

34
00:02:56,719 --> 00:02:58,966
<b>Are there any movies without
dead bodies and detectives?</b>

35
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:01,030
<b>Dead bodies... One second.</b>

36
00:03:04,569 --> 00:03:05,569
<b>What?</b>

37
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:08,439
<b>Yes, all right.</b>

38
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:11,509

<b>Hey, Hyeong Ju.</b>

42
00:03:59,289 --> 00:04:01,659
<b>What happened?
I heard you reported this.</b>

43
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,000
<b>Yes, I came by because
we were going to meet up,</b>

44
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:07,199
<b>then I found him like that.</b>

45
00:04:10,969 --> 00:04:12,069
<b>Let's go inside.</b>

46
00:04:25,579 --> 00:04:28,050
<b>Is something going on?
Why won't you pick up your phone?</b>

47
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:30,625
<b>Mr. Choi Kyung Man's case was
first reported to...</b>

48

<b>one of the police stations in
Makang Police's jurisdiction, right?</b>

<b>Hyeong Ju.</b>

50

<b>Mr. Bae Jung Tae...</b>

51
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,170
<b>died.</b>

52
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:47,699
<b>What?</b>

53
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,269
<b>Hey, why did you come to see him?</b>

54
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,110
<b>Right.</b>

55
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:57,750
<b>Kim Se Rin's case
hasn't been resolved.</b>

56
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:00,279
<b>I was wondering if he knew anything.</b>

57
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,980
<b>And you came at this time?
To his house?</b>

58
00:05:06,019 --> 00:05:08,266
<b>We were about to summon him
for kidnapping and confinement...</b>

59
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:09,865
<b>or as a testifier.</b>

60
00:05:09,889 --> 00:05:12,060
<b>He's way too unpredictable.</b>

61
00:05:12,259 --> 00:05:14,505
<b>I don't know what he was up to,
but he suddenly called me.</b>

62
00:05:14,529 --> 00:05:15,629
<b>That's why...</b>

63
00:05:17,029 --> 00:05:18,230
<b>I decided to come.</b>

64
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,100
<b>I see.</b>

65
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,509
<b>- Sun Ho!
- Yes?</b>

66
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:26,970
<b>You should go.</b>

67
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:41,120
<b>Did you find the culprit?</b>

68
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:43,759
<b>Not yet.</b>

69
00:05:46,189 --> 00:05:49,459
<b>But why did you ask me
about Mr. Choi Kyung Man?</b>

70
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:53,045
<b>Starting with Mr. Choi Kyung Man,
Seo Yeon Soo,</b>

71
00:05:53,069 --> 00:05:55,415
<b>Mr. Cha Jeung Seok, Ms. So Hye In,</b>

72
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:57,240
<b>the delivery man, Se Rin,</b>

73
00:05:59,139 --> 00:06:00,980
<b>and now, Mr. Bae Jung Tae.</b>

74
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,940
<b>Their cases are all within
Makang Police's jurisdiction.</b>

75
00:06:07,449 --> 00:06:09,220
<b>This cannot be a coincidence.</b>

76
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:12,050
<b>All of their deaths...</b>

77
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:14,490
<b>What if they're connected?</b>

78
00:06:16,019 --> 00:06:17,120
<b>How?</b>

79
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:18,560
<b>What if it's a serial killer?</b>

80
00:06:20,389 --> 00:06:22,529
<b>Mr. Choi Kyung Man,
the delivery man,</b>

81
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:24,470
<b>and everyone else
are ordinary people.</b>

82
00:06:25,129 --> 00:06:26,206
<b>Unlike Se Rin's death,</b>

83
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:28,040
<b>their deaths weren't known
to the public.</b>

84
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:32,269
<b>"How did Ms. Lee Shin know
when and where they'd die?"</b>

85
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:35,939
<b>"Why was she interested in us
of all people?"</b>

86
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,379
<b>I checked all the cases,</b>

87
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:40,890
<b>and they all took place...</b>

88
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,649
<b>in the district
of Seoul Makang Police Station.</b>

89
00:06:46,819 --> 00:06:50,319
<b>Do you remember what Ms. Lee said
at the cafe?</b>

90
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:55,629
<b>I was curious...</b>

91
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:59,329
<b>whether fate...</b>

92
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,439
<b>was destined or changeable.</b>

93
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:06,810
<b>That's why I carried out
this experiment.</b>

94
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:08,980
<b>Don't be too scared.</b>

95
00:07:09,139 --> 00:07:14,750
<b>I still have hope
that you can change your fates.</b>

96
00:07:15,579 --> 00:07:17,620
<b>If their deaths were accidental,</b>

97
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,519
<b>it's impossible to change
their fates.</b>

98
00:07:21,089 --> 00:07:23,790
<b>But if there's a serial killer,
then it's different.</b>

99
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:26,129
<b>If we catch the killer,</b>

100
00:07:26,629 --> 00:07:28,860
<b>we can change our fates.</b>

101
00:07:30,329 --> 00:07:31,699
<b>So what if...</b>

102
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:36,175
<b>we were all murdered...</b>

103
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:37,769
<b>by someone?</b>

104
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:46,850
<b>What if that's why she chose us?</b>

105
00:07:52,089 --> 00:07:53,189
<b>Hyeong Ju?</b>

106
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:57,360
<b>Was what I said too ridiculous?</b>

107
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:03,660
<b>No, I'm just a bit flustered.</b>

108
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,800
<b>I'll dig deeper.</b>

109
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,139
<b>I'm sure I'll find a lead...</b>

110
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:12,839
<b>through Bae Jung Tae's case.</b>

111
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:55,179
<b>I've scheduled your appointment.</b>

112
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,389
<b>Come to the hospital by 12 p.m.
the day after tomorrow.</b>

113
00:08:58,889 --> 00:08:59,866
<b>Thanks.</b>

114
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:02,519
<b>The professor helped out
more than I did.</b>

115
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:04,690
<b>You should say thanks.</b>

116
00:09:04,889 --> 00:09:07,429
<b>Okay. I'll see you then.</b>

117
00:09:27,419 --> 00:09:29,059
<b>The cause of death
was excessive bleeding.</b>

118
00:09:29,179 --> 00:09:31,320
<b>He was stabbed
through his left lung.</b>

119
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:34,395
<b>Judging by the stab wound,
I believe it was a knife...</b>

120
00:09:34,419 --> 00:09:36,466
<b>that was 3cm thick and 10cm long.</b>

121
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:38,889
<b>After stabbing him,
the killer twisted the blade.</b>

122
00:09:40,629 --> 00:09:41,830
<b>Darn it.</b>

123
00:09:42,299 --> 00:09:44,176
<b>There were neither signs
of forced entry...</b>

124
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:47,200
<b>or physical altercation.
Do you think he knew the killer?</b>

125
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:51,840
<b>He was murdered merely 12 hours
after our men stopped watching him.</b>

126
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:54,809
<b>I believe the killer
had been watching him.</b>

127
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,586
<b>Are there any key suspects?</b>

128
00:09:56,610 --> 00:10:00,080
<b>He borrowed money and was a gambler.
I'm sure we can come up with a list.</b>

129
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:01,895
<b>Can you think of anyone
in particular?</b>

130
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:04,220
<b>You knew him the best
among all of us.</b>

131
00:10:06,889 --> 00:10:07,990
<b>I'm not sure.</b>

132
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:16,759
<b>All right.
Look into his rap sheet...</b>

133
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:18,899
<b>and see if you can narrow down
the suspect.</b>

134
00:10:19,169 --> 00:10:22,515
<b>Since it happened at his house,
check his belongings...</b>

135
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:23,740
<b>and PF list once again.</b>

136
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,316
<b>Ask around about him...</b>

137
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:29,009
<b>and check the CCTV footages
around his house.</b>

138
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:31,379
<b>You have until our meeting
this evening.</b>

139
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:34,950
<b>There's... There's a serial killer?</b>

140
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:38,625
<b>Are you saying the one
who murdered Mr. Bae Jung Tae...</b>

141
00:10:38,649 --> 00:10:40,289
<b>killed Se Rin as well?</b>

142
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:43,289
<b>This is just my speculation.</b>

143
00:10:47,659 --> 00:10:49,860
<b>What did Detective Ji say?</b>

144
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:53,676
<b>He said he's going to investigate...</b>

145

<b>Wait. Isn't this Mr. Bae Jung Tae?</b>

<b>He's early.</b>

<b>No, they're still working

<b>The forensics team

160

163

<b>Did you lose them?</b>

164
00:12:12,379 --> 00:12:13,826
<b>I think I dropped them

- We didn't find this...</b>

- Yes, sir.</b>

- Ga Hyeon is in danger.</b>

310
00:26:04,339 --> 00:26:05,626
<b>That jerk will kill her too.</b>

311
00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:06,956
<b>That jerk? What are you saying?</b>

312
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:08,255
<b>The one who killed Bae Jung Tae.</b>

313
00:26:08,279 --> 00:26:09,750
<b>He already made a move.</b>

314
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:11,255
<b>I'm sure he did this.</b>

315
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:12,995
<b>He's going to kill Ga Hyeon too!</b>

316
00:26:13,019 --> 00:26:14,995
<b>You need to speak in a language
I can understand.</b>

317
00:26:15,019 --> 00:26:17,059
<b>Why would he kill Ga Hyeon?</b>

318
00:26:40,009 --> 00:26:41,150
<b>Where's Ga Hyeon?</b>

319
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:43,896
<b>Why are you looking for her here?</b>

320
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:46,750
<b>Zian Clinic was the last place
her phone signal went off.</b>

321
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:48,250
<b>Really?</b>

322
00:26:49,289 --> 00:26:50,960
<b>I haven't even seen her.</b>

323
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:52,490
<b>Stop lying.</b>

00:26:53,059 --> 00:26:55,559
<b>Who's the culprit?
Where is Ga Hyeon?</b>

<b>You need to

353

<b>He said I didn't do anything right.</b>

<b>You said you didn't want to

<b>So why do I have to be fired?</b>

<b>I'm sorry, Seung Min.</b>

<b>I showed off to everyone that...</b>

00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:39,289
<b>I became the manager

<b>Hey, stop.</b>

00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:40,710
<b>Ga Hyeon, are you okay?</b>

<b>Are you hurt?</b>

<b>You're under emergency arrest

<b>- Wait, Detective, no.
- You may consult an attorney.</b>

<b>- I was electrocuted...
- You may plead the Fifth.</b>

391
00:31:56,759 --> 00:31:58,259
<b>I was attacked by her.</b>

392
00:32:01,029 --> 00:32:03,269
<b>What if I didn't know
who Ms. Son was?</b>

393
00:32:04,269 --> 00:32:07,140
<b>Samson? Samson is Ms. Son.</b>

394
00:32:07,339 --> 00:32:10,255
<b>- What?
- Then please do take care of this.</b>

395
00:32:10,279 --> 00:32:11,640
<b>Ga... Ga Hyeon.</b>

396
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:17,356
<b>Ji Han was about to reveal
who Samson is.</b>

397
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:18,426
<b>That's how far I got.</b>

398
00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:20,450
<b>So who is Samson?</b>

399
00:32:20,619 --> 00:32:22,936
<b>That brings me to my point.
Before we go in,</b>

400
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,059
<b>can you tell me about the identity?</b>

401
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,089
<b>Ms. Son is her manager.</b>

402
00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:29,700
<b>Why did she suddenly bring that up?</b>

403
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:32,946
<b>Mr. Koo Seung Min was fired?</b>

404
00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:35,716
<b>Yes, he received bribes
from event companies...</b>

405
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:38,099
<b>by using her fan signing event
and promotion event.</b>

406
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:41,539
<b>Those companies disclosed it to us
when the events got canceled.</b>

407
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:46,126
<b>Can you find out
Mr. Koo Seung Min's number?</b>

408
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:49,750
<b>His phone hasn't moved
to another area for an hour.</b>

409
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:52,000
<b>He's at Makang Bridge,
the way that heads to Sancheon.</b>

410
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:07,500
<b>Ko Jae Young was the one
who sent me that voice recording?</b>

411
00:33:09,299 --> 00:33:12,970
<b>Does that mean
he was at the scene of his murder?</b>

412
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:14,839
<b>How?</b>

413
00:33:16,039 --> 00:33:17,480
<b>We'll have to find out.</b>

414
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,180
<b>"We should trust each other."</b>

415
00:33:26,119 --> 00:33:27,390
<b>You said that to me,</b>

416
00:33:27,589 --> 00:33:29,390
<b>yet you suspected I was the culprit?</b>

417
00:33:30,589 --> 00:33:31,660
<b>Come on.</b>

418
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:35,230
<b>Think about how I had to
get this forensically analyzed.</b>

419
00:33:35,329 --> 00:33:37,259
<b>They said this wasn't forged,</b>

420
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:40,470
<b>- so I got suspicious...
- I should thank Koo Seung Min.</b>

421
00:33:40,730 --> 00:33:42,946
<b>- He helped me get vindicated.
- It's not like that.</b>

422
00:33:42,970 --> 00:33:45,000
<b>It's thanks to my theory.</b>

423
00:33:45,339 --> 00:33:47,640
<b>The real culprit is a serial killer.</b>

424
00:33:49,109 --> 00:33:50,680
<b>But you were with me...</b>

425
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:53,555
<b>when Mr. Cha Jeung Seok
and Ms. So Hye In...</b>

426
00:33:53,579 --> 00:33:55,285
<b>- were presumed to have died.
- So...</b>

427
00:33:55,309 --> 00:33:58,619
<b>That's why you aren't the culprit.</b>

428
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:02,490
<b>To be honest,</b>

429
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,190
<b>I wanted to do that to trust you.</b>

430
00:34:07,859 --> 00:34:11,500
<b>There aren't many people...</b>

431
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,500
<b>whom we can trust.</b>

432
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:17,175
<b>Oh, it's only because
there aren't many of us left.</b>

433
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:19,409
<b>I guess I'm grateful
that you still trust me.</b>

434
00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:22,639
<b>- I'm sorry. I'm...
- Wait.</b>

435
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:24,909
<b>I think your theory is right.</b>

436
00:34:25,949 --> 00:34:27,050
<b>A serial killer.</b>

437
00:34:27,909 --> 00:34:31,320
<b>There was a weird photo at the scene
of Bae Jung Tae's murder.</b>

438
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:44,429
<b>He took photos and left evidence.</b>

439
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:48,900
<b>And then, he left them
at Bae Jung Tae's house?</b>

440
00:34:49,330 --> 00:34:52,869
<b>Why would the killer do that?</b>

441
00:35:10,689 --> 00:35:11,789
<b>Where's the USB?</b>

442
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:16,090
<b>Here.</b>

443
00:35:19,759 --> 00:35:22,375
<b>I reported it to the chief.</b>

444
00:35:22,399 --> 00:35:23,429
<b>What did he say?</b>

445
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:25,500
<b>What do you think?
He said the same thing I said.</b>

446
00:35:26,969 --> 00:35:28,116
<b>How could you assume
that this is a serial killing...</b>

447
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:30,415
<b>merely with those six photos?</b>

448
00:35:30,439 --> 00:35:31,756
<b>That's why we should investigate.</b>

449
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:35,256
<b>Hyeong Ju, have you ever seen
a serial killing like this...</b>

450
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,210
<b>during the past seven years
on our team?</b>

451
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:40,920
<b>The victims' genders, age group,
occupations,</b>

452
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,090
<b>places of residence, or the MO.</b>

453
00:35:43,489 --> 00:35:45,790
<b>What kind of serial killing
has no similarities?</b>

454
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:47,659
<b>Well...</b>

455
00:35:49,659 --> 00:35:52,176
<b>Perhaps, the killer
feels pleasure...</b>

456
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,775
<b>in how his disguises are good...</b>

457
00:35:53,799 --> 00:35:55,700
<b>and in how he fools the police well.</b>

458
00:35:56,069 --> 00:35:58,245
<b>Based on the voice recording,
the killer is a detective.</b>

459
00:35:58,269 --> 00:35:59,245
<b>You should call
the Seoul Metropolitan...</b>

460
00:35:59,269 --> 00:36:00,309
<b>- Police Agency...
- First,</b>

<b>focus on summoning

<b>Ko Jae Young sent this?</b>

- I had spotted someone suspicious,</b>

<b>if he connected the killer

<b>Some witnesses switched

<b>And a witness testified

have been working together?</b>

766
00:56:24,329 --> 00:56:26,230
<b>She went through the reset with me.</b>

767
00:56:28,329 --> 00:56:30,099
<b>And the names you saw
in my notes...</b>

768
00:56:30,630 --> 00:56:32,569
<b>They all underwent the reset.</b>

769
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:35,569
<b>Even the people who died?</b>

770
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:37,309
<b>Yes.</b>

771
00:56:39,410 --> 00:56:41,180
<b>Someone out there is killing us.</b>

772
00:56:42,210 --> 00:56:46,150
<b>I thought whoever killed
Bae Jung Tae would kill Ga Hyeon...</b>

773
00:56:46,750 --> 00:56:47,849
<b>because of our connection.</b>

774
00:56:50,220 --> 00:56:51,819
<b>Koo Seung Min isn't the culprit.</b>

775
00:56:53,559 --> 00:56:55,890
<b>But there's still a murderer
who's trying to kill us.</b>

776
00:57:58,650 --> 00:57:59,990
<b>Can you pull over?</b>

777
00:58:08,630 --> 00:58:10,406
<b>(Choi Young Woong isn't
the only one that must be silenced.)</b>

778
00:58:10,430 --> 00:58:12,270
<b>(Unless you want this to go viral,
contact me.)</b>

779
00:58:13,099 --> 00:58:14,416
<b>- Let go of the sneakers.
- Throw it.</b>

780
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:15,716
<b>- Does it hurt? Does it?
- Get up.</b>

781
00:58:15,740 --> 00:58:17,140
<b>- Min Ho, does it hurt?
- Hey.</b>

782
00:58:17,369 --> 00:58:19,269
<b>- Go ahead. Do it.
- Does it hurt?</b>

00:58:19,609 --> 00:58:20,839
<b>Hook your leg.</b>

784
00:58:31,390 --> 00:58:32,390
<b>Who on earth are you?</b>

785
00:58:34,420 --> 00:58:36,589
<b>You told Detective Park
about the reset?</b>

786
00:58:38,630 --> 00:58:39,660
<b>What did he say?</b>

787
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:42,460
<b>It's the same reaction we had
when we heard about the reset.</b>

788
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:46,539
<b>But...</b>

789
00:58:47,599 --> 00:58:49,170
<b>he said he'll just believe me.</b>

790
00:58:50,740 --> 00:58:52,769
<b>He said a lot of the cases
were solved when he did.</b>

791
00:58:56,910 --> 00:58:58,650
<b>He'll just believe you.</b>

792
00:59:00,079 --> 00:59:01,480
<b>That's nice.</b>

793
00:59:02,420 --> 00:59:03,720
<b>Of course.</b>

794
00:59:04,150 --> 00:59:07,559
<b>As someone who's been suspected,
I'm the most grateful to hear that.</b>

795
00:59:12,190 --> 00:59:13,529
<b>You know what?</b>

796
00:59:14,859 --> 00:59:16,869
<b>I still don't regret
that I did the reset.</b>

797
00:59:19,329 --> 00:59:21,670
<b>It's like a nightmare.
And it's still tough.</b>

798
00:59:23,970 --> 00:59:25,970
<b>Even if I have to go
through the same thing,</b>

799
00:59:27,609 --> 00:59:30,329
<b>as long as I get to save someone
who will believe me unconditionally,</b>

800
00:59:32,049 --> 00:59:33,480
<b>I'll make the same decision.</b>

801
00:59:34,849 --> 00:59:36,750
<b>You might want to undergo the reset,</b>

802
00:59:37,789 --> 00:59:39,349
<b>but it's only possible
if you survive.</b>

803
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:41,460
<b>Of course, we'll survive...</b>

804
00:59:41,759 --> 00:59:43,289
<b>because I'll catch the culprit.</b>

805
00:59:53,740 --> 00:59:57,039
<b>What a surprise.
You played along today.</b>

806
00:59:59,039 --> 01:00:00,039
<b>Darn it.</b>

807
01:00:03,279 --> 01:00:04,480
<b>Where is it?</b>

808
01:01:12,380 --> 01:01:14,549
<b>(Young Woong and Se Rin,
our 1st day together)</b>

809
01:01:22,420 --> 01:01:23,490
<b>This is...</b>

810
01:01:50,950 --> 01:01:52,150
<b>Look at him smiling.</b>

811
01:01:55,259 --> 01:01:56,930
<b>Don't they look familiar?</b>

812
01:02:10,509 --> 01:02:11,869
<b>Detective Park.</b>

813
01:02:26,619 --> 01:02:28,859
<b>Did you think I was Hyeong Ju?</b>

814
01:02:32,029 --> 01:02:33,059
<b>Darn it.</b>

815
01:02:33,630 --> 01:02:36,559
<b>I didn't kill him.
Someone else killed him.</b>

816
01:02:44,470 --> 01:02:46,140
<b>That means you know
who the culprit is.</b>

817
01:02:46,569 --> 01:02:47,740
<b>I...</b>

818
01:02:49,609 --> 01:02:51,210
<b>saw with my own eyes.</b>

819
01:02:53,079 --> 01:02:54,549
<b>You finally found out who it was.</b>

820
01:02:56,349 --> 01:02:57,789
<b>But you won't have a chance to talk.</b>

821
01:02:58,619 --> 01:02:59,619
<b>Darn it.</b>

<b>(365: Repeat the Year)</b>

823

<b>How long have you been deceiving me?</b>

824
01:03:34,319 --> 01:03:36,706
<b>I'll go. It's more useful
than you'd think.</b>

825
01:03:36,730 --> 01:03:39,666
<b>If you just kill him,
that's too merciful.</b>

826
01:03:39,690 --> 01:03:43,176
<b>She underwent a reset

<b>I'm sorry for putting you
in pain again.</b>

828
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:46,646
<b>Does it mean you witnessed the act?</b>

829
01:03:46,670 --> 01:03:49,845
<b>Making him suffer in pain

<b>I really hope I'm next.</b>

832
01:03:55,009 --> 01:03:57,880
<b>I'll catch the culprit,
