12

- And I found the child...</b>

<b>who was buried in the mountains.</b>

105

<b>Then I moved the remains

106

<b>Do you expect me to believe that?</b>

<b>I'm only telling you the facts.</b>

<b>It's up to you to believe it or not.</b>

<b>All right, let's say that's true.</b>

113
00:14:03,586 --> 00:14:06,879
<b>Then why... Why did you do it?</b>

114
00:14:08,507 --> 00:14:11,183
<b>You dug up a buried child...</b>

115
00:14:11,284 --> 00:14:13,318
<b>then wrapped it up in a box...</b>

116
00:14:13,695 --> 00:14:16,171
<b>and buried it again in
the cathedral. Why?</b>

117
00:14:17,734 --> 00:14:20,692
<b>Did you form a meaningful
relationship with Hwa Young?</b>

118

<b>Or did she ask that as a last

<b>You killed her. Didn't you?</b>

<b>I felt bad for the child.</b>

121
00:14:32,597 --> 00:14:34,006
<b>You felt bad?</b>

122
00:14:36,164 --> 00:14:38,266
<b>I guess you came up with
some sort of a story.</b>

123
00:14:38,644 --> 00:14:40,242
<b>But who would believe you?</b>

124
00:14:44,109 --> 00:14:46,578
<b>You killed a woman when you were 15.</b>

125
00:14:47,539 --> 00:14:49,758
<b>Do you want me to read
your criminal records again?</b>

126

<b>You killing that girl back then...</b>

127
00:14:55,367 --> 00:14:56,930
<b>is also a fact, isn't it?</b>

128
00:15:00,023 --> 00:15:02,023
<b>- I don't know about that.
- You don't know?</b>

129
00:15:08,844 --> 00:15:10,509
<b>I have a question.</b>

130
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:14,211
<b>Why did you ring the neighbor's

131
00:15:16,663 --> 00:15:17,796
<b>The neighbor's bell?</b>

132
00:15:19,843 --> 00:15:21,671
<b>I pressed a doorbell?</b>

133
00:15:31,477 --> 00:15:34,733
<b>But what does that bell have
anything to do with the sock?</b>

134
00:15:34,803 --> 00:15:37,453
<b>You pressed the bell then
waved the sock.</b>

135
00:15:38,016 --> 00:15:40,939
<b>Someone like you wouldn't have
pressed that bell by accident.</b>

136
00:15:41,234 --> 00:15:43,234
<b>Tell me why you set up a witness.</b>

137

<b>Sir.</b>

138

141
00:16:35,752 --> 00:16:38,797
<b>I don't care whether it's the DNA
or the fingerprints.</b>

142
00:16:39,594 --> 00:16:42,568

hide them. You're good at that.</b>

143
00:16:43,148 --> 00:16:46,500
<b>But why did you do it this time?</b>

144
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:49,766
<b>Why?</b>

145
00:16:51,211 --> 00:16:54,279
<b>Should we call a press conference

<b>Are you trying to be my enemy?</b>

150

<b>Why do people play the victim...</b>

<b>when they are the ones at fault?</b>

152

<b>That woman killed her own child

<b>No.</b>

00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:33,197
<b>The energy produced by the heart
in one hour is...</b>

307
00:30:33,231 --> 00:30:35,127
<b>equivalent to lifting a person
of 75 kg...</b>

308
00:30:35,151 --> 00:30:38,069
<b>to the top
of a three-floor building.</b>

309
00:30:39,166 --> 00:30:43,007
<b>A heart failure rate is lower
than an ultra-precision machine.</b>

310
00:30:47,045 --> 00:30:48,079
<b>Bovie.</b>

311
00:31:01,125 --> 00:31:03,761
<b>A heart weighs 350 to 600 grams.</b>

312
00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:05,292
<b>The heart is located...</b>

313
00:31:06,729 --> 00:31:09,367
<b>at the center of the chest...</b>

314
00:31:09,537 --> 00:31:10,797
<b>at the front.</b>

315
00:31:11,669 --> 00:31:14,616
<b>It's shaped like a cone
between the two lungs.</b>

316
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,941
<b>It's a piece of muscle
as small as a fist.</b>

317
00:31:17,369 --> 00:31:18,876
<b>The purpose of the heart is...</b>

318
00:31:19,792 --> 00:31:23,514
<b>only to apply pressure
like a piston engine.</b>

319
00:31:24,282 --> 00:31:25,901
<b>The blood
that enters the left ventricle...</b>

320
00:31:25,925 --> 00:31:28,005
<b>through the bicuspid valve
from the left atrium is...</b>

321
00:31:29,592 --> 00:31:31,380
<b>a muscle activity
of the left ventricle...</b>

322
00:31:31,404 --> 00:31:32,624
<b>that opens the aorta valve.</b>

323
00:31:33,024 --> 00:31:35,493
<b>It rises to the aorta
flowing throughout the body.</b>

324
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:41,933
<b>The human genes are still active
for 24 hours after death.</b>

325
00:31:42,934 --> 00:31:45,536
<b>The heart still beats
even during brain death.</b>

326
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:47,801
<b>A heart is...</b>

327
00:31:48,011 --> 00:31:50,527
<b>To me, a heart is a gift.</b>

328
00:31:50,551 --> 00:31:52,119
<b>To me,</b>

329
00:31:53,177 --> 00:31:54,278
<b>a heart is a machine.</b>

<b>(Episode 12)</b>

331

00:32:12,619 --> 00:32:14,329
<b>immunosuppressive drug

333
00:32:14,353 --> 00:32:16,687
<b>one can experience abnormalities
of heart beat, respiration,</b>

334
00:32:16,711 --> 00:32:18,747
<b>and even end up in death.
Don't you know?</b>

335
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:21,560
<b>Because of the substance
in grape fruit,</b>

336
00:32:21,584 --> 00:32:23,418
<b>the effects
of immunosuppressive drug will...</b>

337
00:32:23,451 --> 00:32:25,297
<b>become five to ten times higher,</b>

338
00:32:25,321 --> 00:32:27,344
<b>leading to severe side effects.</b>

339
00:32:27,368 --> 00:32:31,459
<b>How did you know that I had
a heart transplant?</b>

340
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:35,330
<b>Few people would be unaware of that
as a medical student.</b>

341
00:32:37,068 --> 00:32:40,101
<b>The article of your interview was
translated into five languages.</b>

<b>The first to get the transplant from
a death-row convict 18 years ago.</b>

00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:50,045
<b>Oh, gosh.</b>

344
00:32:50,812 --> 00:32:51,812
<b>By the way,</b>

345
00:32:53,214 --> 00:32:55,283
<b>- I have a gift for you.
- A gift?</b>

346
00:32:56,128 --> 00:32:58,753
<b>I'd figured you'd like old stones
since you like skulls so much.</b>

347
00:33:00,902 --> 00:33:03,658
<b>It's an old stone that flew here
from the universe.</b>

348
00:33:04,846 --> 00:33:07,762
<b>It's a necklace made with meteorite
fallen in Argentine 5,000 years ago.</b>

349
00:33:08,502 --> 00:33:10,170
<b>It's been certified
by the observatory...</b>

350
00:33:10,411 --> 00:33:11,666
<b>so it's got to be real.</b>

351
00:33:12,567 --> 00:33:14,269
<b>It's shining
although it's just a stone.</b>

352
00:33:14,866 --> 00:33:16,786
<b>It'll amaze you
because the color keeps changing.</b>

353
00:33:16,938 --> 00:33:17,939
<b>Why don't you try it on?</b>

<b>He only dates girls

<b>I want to ask you something.</b>

356
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:49,020
<b>What do you think about women

357
00:33:49,204 --> 00:33:50,305
<b>Surgery scars?</b>

358
00:33:51,283 --> 00:33:53,243
<b>A medical student would
have nothing against that.</b>

359
00:33:54,867 --> 00:33:56,611
<b>Isn't it done yet?</b>

360
00:33:57,526 --> 00:33:58,526
<b>It's done now.</b>

361
00:34:00,578 --> 00:34:02,650
<b>Are you feeling cold?
Why are you shivering?</b>

362
00:34:04,921 --> 00:34:06,082
<b>Isn't it obvious?</b>

363
00:34:06,106 --> 00:34:08,608
<b>I'm allowing someone to touch
my neck.</b>

364
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:10,831
<b>That's not it.</b>

365
00:34:11,005 --> 00:34:14,662
<b>I mean I'm allowing someone to touch
my body. That's also not it.</b>

366
00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:16,830
<b>I'll go now.</b>

367
00:34:43,788 --> 00:34:44,893
<b>What are you doing?</b>

368
00:34:52,147 --> 00:34:55,355
<b>It's 50 cm tall and assumed to be
less than 2 months old.</b>

369
00:34:55,397 --> 00:34:57,372
<b>The gender is unverifiable.</b>

370
00:35:00,173 --> 00:35:02,310
<b>The baby had to shut it's eyes
by the time...</b>

371
00:35:02,544 --> 00:35:04,145
<b>it could meet it's mother's eyes.</b>

372
00:35:08,386 --> 00:35:09,484
<b>Are you done now?</b>

373
00:35:10,214 --> 00:35:13,033
<b>This baby didn't even start
to get teeth.</b>

374
00:35:13,057 --> 00:35:15,223
<b>We got the DNA results
for this baby remains.</b>

375
00:35:16,057 --> 00:35:18,489
<b>It's the biological child of Lim
from Pureun Studio Apartment.</b>

376
00:35:18,513 --> 00:35:19,755
<b>And Chun Jong Bum is...</b>

377
00:35:20,422 --> 00:35:22,342
<b>the suspect for the murder case
of Lim Hwa Young.</b>

378

<b>I could send you the records of the
case investigation if you'd like.</b>

379
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,834
<b>Did you say Chun Jong Bum?</b>

380
00:35:35,124 --> 00:35:38,713
<b>Isn't it the most dangerous thing
to specify a suspect...</b>

381
00:35:38,746 --> 00:35:41,482
<b>when you are under investigation?</b>

382
00:35:45,019 --> 00:35:46,120
<b>Why are you...</b>

383
00:35:46,892 --> 00:35:48,156
<b>giving him a chance?</b>

384
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:53,804
<b>You shoudn't do that to a guy like
Chun Jong Bum.</b>

385
00:35:53,828 --> 00:35:57,298
<b>Sometimes beasts live among humans
and have the look of a human being.</b>

386
00:35:57,339 --> 00:35:58,600
<b>They're hiding their instincts.</b>

387
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:03,037
<b>Those beasts will bite a person off
if there's the slightest chance.</b>

388
00:36:03,671 --> 00:36:06,975
<b>Murder is what happens
within that chance,</b>

389
00:36:07,491 --> 00:36:08,776
<b>not in a broad daylight.</b>

390
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:13,081
<b>I can no longer have
those beasts hurt my people...</b>

391
00:36:13,353 --> 00:36:14,849
<b>after they get this chance.</b>

392
00:36:15,183 --> 00:36:18,186
<b>That chance may seem to be little,
but my father...</b>

393
00:36:23,411 --> 00:36:24,726
<b>Prosecutor,</b>

394
00:36:25,456 --> 00:36:27,462
<b>why do you always lose your temper
before me?</b>

395
00:36:30,298 --> 00:36:31,766
<b>I never lost my temper.</b>

396
00:36:32,267 --> 00:36:33,684
<b>I'll ask you again.</b>

397
00:36:33,761 --> 00:36:36,042
<b>Why are you always concerned
about me while you are angry?</b>

398
00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:39,707
<b>- Concerned?
- You're being concerned about me.</b>

399
00:36:41,577 --> 00:36:42,644
<b>Let's stop here.</b>

400
00:36:46,851 --> 00:36:47,949
<b>Geez.</b>

401
00:36:51,519 --> 00:36:53,588
<b>(Model demonstration)</b>

402
00:36:59,452 --> 00:37:01,929
<b>Did you separate the bones

403
00:37:02,897 --> 00:37:04,966
<b>You're the best at this job.</b>

404
00:37:05,567 --> 00:37:07,568
<b>Did you handle the bones well?</b>

405
00:37:10,006 --> 00:37:11,646
<b>Oh, Chun Jong Bum.</b>

406
00:37:12,352 --> 00:37:14,375
<b>I'll be there soon. Bye.</b>

407
00:37:15,143 --> 00:37:17,378
<b>I happened to overhear
your conversation, unwillingly.</b>

408
00:37:17,564 --> 00:37:19,447
<b>Would my bones and flesh
be seperated now?</b>

409
00:37:20,063 --> 00:37:21,582
<b>What brings you here?</b>

410
00:37:21,649 --> 00:37:24,519
<b>- I live nearby.
- Oh, really? Where is it?</b>

411
00:37:29,209 --> 00:37:31,192
<b>This is your house?</b>

412
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:33,594
<b>No, it's the rooftop house

<b>Lady Sabin!</b>

<b>When you're feeling lonely,

<b>When you're feeling blue,

416
00:37:50,578 --> 00:37:54,482
<b>When you're feeling lonely,

<b>Come to see me</b>

418
00:38:02,757 --> 00:38:04,992
<b>It's good to see you again.</b>

419
00:38:07,044 --> 00:38:10,398
<b>Did you say the kid's name was

420
00:38:15,621 --> 00:38:17,982
<b>Do you like salmon or something

<b>Hey. Put that knife down, right now.</b>

422
00:38:19,975 --> 00:38:22,987
<b>I raised my child with this knife.</b>

423

<b>If you hold up a knife, looking

<b>who will think you're

<b>People will think you're a defect

<b>going to kill your wife

<b>A defect?</b>

<b>An ex-convict?</b>

429
00:38:37,484 --> 00:38:38,559
<b>A defect.</b>

430
00:38:39,476 --> 00:38:40,628
<b>An ex-convict.</b>

431
00:38:49,183 --> 00:38:50,805
<b>I didn't kill someone,</b>

432
00:38:51,636 --> 00:38:53,174
<b>but it was attempted murder.</b>

433
00:38:55,965 --> 00:38:59,290
<b>Why are you talking so much,

<b>I shall change the location

<b>Between attempted murder...</b>

<b>and jerks who betray

<b>who is worse off?</b>

442
00:39:24,106 --> 00:39:25,973
<b>- Should I be frank?
- Be honest with me.</b>

443
00:39:26,913 --> 00:39:29,143
<b>I think it's neck and neck.</b>

444

<b>I should tear you two to shreds
and quarter you.</b>

445

<b>But I think playing
with people's minds is...</b>

446
00:39:38,253 --> 00:39:41,289
<b>a bit more unlikeable, personally.</b>

447

<b>- That's right.
- Why you...</b>

<b>Tell me who is more of a jerk.</b>

<b>- I want to ask you something.
- Go ahead.</b>

454

<b>Did you give up trying to murder

00:40:05,158 --> 00:40:06,981
<b>You must've made a plan
for your murder.</b>

457
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,984
<b>Didn't you feel despondent
after you'd given up?</b>

458
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:12,220
<b>Amen.</b>

459
00:40:13,322 --> 00:40:15,967
<b>Everyone who can hear shall
hear him.</b>

460
00:40:15,991 --> 00:40:19,269
<b>Jong Bum, you're like
a forensic psychologist.</b>

461
00:40:19,293 --> 00:40:21,573
<b>You're my type of guy,
both the way you look...</b>

462
00:40:21,597 --> 00:40:23,341
<b>and the way you talk.</b>

463
00:40:23,365 --> 00:40:26,334
<b>Everyone who can hear shall
hear him.</b>

464
00:40:26,910 --> 00:40:30,771
<b>You're pretending to know even when
you don't know, you jerk.</b>

465
00:40:31,506 --> 00:40:32,506
<b>You jerk.</b>

466
00:40:33,341 --> 00:40:35,576
<b>Help yourself.</b>

467
00:41:12,004 --> 00:41:14,582
<b>Jong Bum, aren't you going to tell
me to come inside?</b>

468
00:41:15,326 --> 00:41:16,728
<b>I came here because I missed you.</b>

469
00:41:16,752 --> 00:41:18,252
<b>Don't you think you've done enough?</b>

470
00:41:32,942 --> 00:41:34,101
<b>Look at this place.</b>

471
00:41:34,582 --> 00:41:36,137
<b>How could you live here?</b>

472
00:41:36,545 --> 00:41:39,707
<b>You really must be
a different breed from me.</b>

473
00:41:40,537 --> 00:41:43,321
<b>I couldn't live a day in this place.</b>

474
00:41:43,345 --> 00:41:45,543
<b>If Dad found out you came here,</b>

475
00:41:46,382 --> 00:41:47,782
<b>he'll be really angry.</b>

476
00:41:48,465 --> 00:41:49,465
<b>To me?</b>

477
00:41:50,151 --> 00:41:51,452
<b>He'll be angry at you.</b>

478
00:42:03,452 --> 00:42:06,801
<b>You should hang those in your room.
Don't you think?</b>

479
00:42:07,904 --> 00:42:08,904
<b>Why?</b>

480
00:42:09,503 --> 00:42:11,439
<b>Did you leave it
so you could return?</b>

481
00:42:31,905 --> 00:42:33,427
<b>Drink it, brother.</b>

482
00:42:34,123 --> 00:42:35,403
<b>If you don't drink your juice...</b>

483
00:42:35,833 --> 00:42:37,809
<b>Mom would be disappointed in you.</b>

484
00:42:37,833 --> 00:42:39,000
<b>His brother?</b>

485
00:42:42,696 --> 00:42:45,373
<b>If I don't drink it, you would be
disappointed not mom.</b>

486
00:42:45,982 --> 00:42:47,112
<b>Why don't you drink it?</b>

487
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:50,032
<b>You should have a taste
of something you made.</b>

488
00:42:50,224 --> 00:42:51,224
<b>What?</b>

489
00:42:51,749 --> 00:42:53,180
<b>You drank it even though you knew?</b>

490
00:42:54,911 --> 00:42:57,052
<b>We can't become a family...</b>

491
00:42:57,301 --> 00:42:59,133
<b>because you're spiteful like that.</b>

492
00:43:00,005 --> 00:43:01,220
<b>I feel bad for you.</b>

493
00:43:01,455 --> 00:43:03,124
<b>You even ate detergent...</b>

494
00:43:03,514 --> 00:43:05,326
<b>just so you could stay at our house?</b>

495
00:43:05,819 --> 00:43:07,428
<b>I don't have to drink it anymore.</b>

496
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,030
<b>Take all of it with you.</b>

497
00:43:11,277 --> 00:43:14,235
<b>I guess we're not family anymore.</b>

498
00:43:24,089 --> 00:43:25,112
<b>Who is it?</b>

499
00:43:25,406 --> 00:43:26,447
<b>Hello.</b>

500
00:43:26,778 --> 00:43:28,983
<b>I'm Jong Bum's little brother.</b>

501
00:43:30,774 --> 00:43:32,653
<b>Jong Bum, I'll be going now.</b>

502
00:43:34,321 --> 00:43:35,489
<b>Oh, right.</b>

503
00:43:40,925 --> 00:43:44,265
<b>Mom told me to tell you to come
to the charity party this weekend.</b>

504
00:43:58,408 --> 00:44:01,125
<b>My uncle told me to give it to you
because the heating here is bad...</b>

505
00:44:01,149 --> 00:44:02,817
<b>due to construction.</b>

506
00:44:15,439 --> 00:44:16,464
<b>Don't touch it.</b>

507
00:44:17,948 --> 00:44:19,200
<b>I told you not to touch it.</b>

508
00:44:58,339 --> 00:44:59,440
<b>Are you stupid?</b>

509
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:01,142
<b>You shouldn't have...</b>

510
00:45:01,613 --> 00:45:04,821
<b>taken anything if you knew
someone meddled with it.</b>

511
00:45:04,845 --> 00:45:06,263
<b>If you didn't want that...</b>

512
00:45:06,495 --> 00:45:08,292
<b>you should have splashed
it in his face.</b>

513
00:45:08,316 --> 00:45:10,317
<b>Your little brother is doing this
to you!</b>

514
00:45:11,456 --> 00:45:14,188
<b>You should have at least told your
family. Who drinks this?</b>

515
00:45:18,062 --> 00:45:19,160
<b>I'm warning you.</b>

516
00:45:20,774 --> 00:45:21,962
<b>Don't come any closer.</b>

517
00:45:24,475 --> 00:45:25,475
<b>Why did you do it?</b>

518
00:45:27,128 --> 00:45:29,614
<b>Answer me. Why did you drink it
even though you knew?</b>

519
00:45:29,638 --> 00:45:31,605
<b>- Because I needed to be there.
- There?</b>

520
00:45:31,717 --> 00:45:33,396
<b>That was the only place
I could go to.</b>

521
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:41,200
<b>Go.</b>

522
00:45:43,818 --> 00:45:44,818
<b>Why?</b>

523
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:49,200
<b>Because you were a juvenile criminal
or because you're a psychopath?</b>

524
00:45:49,323 --> 00:45:50,323
<b>So...</b>

525
00:45:50,835 --> 00:45:52,555
<b>is that why your family's doing
this to you?</b>

526
00:45:57,465 --> 00:45:59,934
<b>Even though you can't feel...</b>

527
00:46:01,173 --> 00:46:02,904
<b>my anger, sadness, or hardship...</b>

528
00:46:03,124 --> 00:46:05,105
<b>you can analyze and predict them.</b>

529
00:46:06,198 --> 00:46:09,109
<b>That's what people call
cold empathy.</b>

530
00:46:20,944 --> 00:46:23,357
<b>All of your anger,
sadness, and hardship,</b>

531
00:46:24,302 --> 00:46:25,559
<b>I can feel them.</b>

532
00:46:27,554 --> 00:46:28,554
<b>That's...</b>

533
00:46:29,444 --> 00:46:31,165
<b>what people call hot empathy.</b>

534
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:34,935
<b>So there is no one in this world...</b>

535
00:46:36,371 --> 00:46:40,608
<b>who can't empathize
with another's pain.</b>

536
00:46:46,413 --> 00:46:47,413
<b>Go away.</b>

537
00:47:33,761 --> 00:47:35,930
<b>I'd go see that woman
even if I die.</b>

538
00:47:37,004 --> 00:47:39,348
<b>I'm going to meet that woman
even if I die.</b>

539
00:48:20,881 --> 00:48:23,833
<b>You don't look well.
What's wrong?</b>

540
00:48:24,786 --> 00:48:26,580
<b>I have something on my mind.</b>

541
00:48:29,536 --> 00:48:33,120
<b>Su Hyuk, your mate for this lifetime
is Sang Ah.</b>

542
00:48:33,465 --> 00:48:35,098
<b>She's you're meant-to-be.</b>

543
00:48:35,123 --> 00:48:37,504
<b>You have to protect her...</b>

544
00:48:38,150 --> 00:48:41,261
<b>- if something bad happens to her.
- Did you two plan this?</b>

545
00:48:43,309 --> 00:48:46,033
<b>A relationship so close that hurts
in the past life...</b>

546
00:48:46,189 --> 00:48:48,802
<b>will just graze you
in the present life.</b>

547
00:48:49,239 --> 00:48:52,246
<b>But a bad relationship
in your past life...</b>

548
00:48:52,270 --> 00:48:55,840
<b>will come back to untie that knot.</b>

549
00:48:56,262 --> 00:48:58,786
<b>So just...</b>

550
00:48:58,926 --> 00:49:01,458
<b>be nice and loving to each other.</b>

551
00:49:01,482 --> 00:49:03,817
<b>Su Hyuk, you heard her.</b>

552
00:49:05,356 --> 00:49:07,187
<b>You need to be good to me.</b>

553
00:49:10,708 --> 00:49:13,027
<b>So you're okay with us being bad
in the past life?</b>

554
00:49:15,809 --> 00:49:16,809
<b>Here.</b>

555
00:49:17,583 --> 00:49:19,777
<b>I started making string bracelets...</b>

556
00:49:19,801 --> 00:49:22,903
<b>because of a female osteology
professor, who's a regular here,</b>

557
00:49:23,215 --> 00:49:25,906
<b>but this is doing great as a hobby.</b>

558
00:49:29,551 --> 00:49:33,547
<b>If this was a ring, I would have
today's date engraved on it.</b>

559
00:49:34,247 --> 00:49:37,351
<b>Right, Mom? What a pity.</b>

560
00:49:50,664 --> 00:49:53,497
<b>I will put the ring that the dead
couldn't let go even after death...</b>

561
00:49:53,535 --> 00:49:55,326
<b>on his bride's finger.</b>

562
00:50:00,231 --> 00:50:03,777
<b>- Where are you?
- In the autopsy room, why?</b>

563
00:50:03,911 --> 00:50:05,036
<b>I'll be there.</b>

564
00:50:07,130 --> 00:50:09,334
<b>Geez.</b>

565
00:50:12,512 --> 00:50:14,901
<b>Hey, mister.</b>

566
00:50:14,926 --> 00:50:18,325
<b>Why are you beating again?</b>

567
00:50:18,855 --> 00:50:20,074
<b>Why?</b>

568
00:50:43,762 --> 00:50:46,903
<b>You're disturbing my leisure time
on the weekends.</b>

569
00:50:47,395 --> 00:50:49,275
<b>I'll leave right away
after I hand this to you.</b>

570
00:50:53,060 --> 00:50:54,228
<b>This is...</b>

571
00:50:54,864 --> 00:50:57,012
<b>We found six bodies related to the
Byun Sung Hoon case...</b>

572
00:50:57,036 --> 00:50:59,066
<b>and he'll be put on trial soon.</b>

573
00:50:59,785 --> 00:51:01,714
<b>You can return the ring to
its owner.</b>

574
00:51:04,278 --> 00:51:05,559
<b>I'll be on my way.</b>

575
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:08,043
<b>Hey.</b>

576
00:51:08,809 --> 00:51:10,809
<b>Since you're here already
let's go together.</b>

577
00:51:13,629 --> 00:51:15,949
<b>We should return the ring together.</b>

578
00:51:17,965 --> 00:51:24,958
<b>(Old Future)</b>

579
00:51:26,793 --> 00:51:28,862
<b>(Old Future)</b>

580
00:51:54,309 --> 00:51:55,520
<b>Mister.</b>

581
00:51:57,731 --> 00:51:59,778
<b>Do you use this stamp...</b>

582
00:51:59,803 --> 00:52:01,771
<b>in this bookstore?</b>

583
00:52:01,795 --> 00:52:03,063
<b>("Old Future")</b>

584
00:52:03,309 --> 00:52:04,731
<b>Not anymore.</b>

585
00:52:04,950 --> 00:52:07,700
<b>We used to use it a long time ago.</b>

586
00:52:10,668 --> 00:52:12,574
<b>Then,</b>

587
00:52:12,598 --> 00:52:15,042
<b>how long have you run
this book store?</b>

588
00:52:15,471 --> 00:52:18,712
<b>It's been about 30 years.</b>

589
00:52:19,668 --> 00:52:21,769
<b>After the former owner died,</b>

590
00:52:21,793 --> 00:52:23,895
<b>his daughter died.</b>

591
00:52:24,492 --> 00:52:26,012
<b>I took over after that.</b>

592
00:52:26,627 --> 00:52:27,888
<b>A daughter?</b>

593
00:52:27,990 --> 00:52:31,325
<b>You must've known
the daughter well.</b>

594
00:52:31,350 --> 00:52:32,934
<b>She's already dead.</b>

595
00:52:33,667 --> 00:52:38,565
<b>I went to her funeral too
30 years ago.</b>

596
00:52:39,598 --> 00:52:42,502
<b>- She's dead.
- Yes.</b>

597
00:52:43,317 --> 00:52:44,771
<b>I knew this would happen.</b>

598
00:52:45,090 --> 00:52:47,490
<b>Did you think you'd meet her
if you came here without notice?</b>

599
00:53:00,442 --> 00:53:01,770
<b>How can they look...</b>

600
00:53:02,689 --> 00:53:04,817
<b>that much alike?</b>

601
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:14,020
<b>But it seems like
time has stopped here.</b>

602
00:53:14,370 --> 00:53:16,011
<b>That's possible.</b>

603
00:53:16,503 --> 00:53:18,272
<b>There haven't been...</b>

604
00:53:18,552 --> 00:53:20,926
<b>any new books for 30 years.</b>

605
00:53:21,488 --> 00:53:22,918
<b>I want to keep it that way...</b>

606
00:53:23,510 --> 00:53:25,278
<b>until the day I die.</b>

607
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:36,129
<b>This book has been out of print
but here it is.</b>

608
00:53:38,254 --> 00:53:40,527
<b>There are theses here too.
Oh, my goodness.</b>

609
00:53:43,082 --> 00:53:44,941
<b>Go ahead and choose a book.</b>

610
00:53:44,965 --> 00:53:47,614
<b>I'll buy you a book today.</b>

611
00:53:48,822 --> 00:53:51,230
<b>Aren't you here
to look for the owner of the ring?</b>

612
00:54:07,688 --> 00:54:08,722
<b>(Resurrection)</b>

613
00:54:12,246 --> 00:54:13,637
<b>I'll take this.</b>

614
00:54:23,105 --> 00:54:24,161
<b>It's raining.</b>

615
00:54:26,895 --> 00:54:28,333
<b>The books will get wet.</b>

616
00:54:37,481 --> 00:54:38,961
<b>Do you like the rain?</b>

617
00:54:38,985 --> 00:54:41,504
<b>Everything that falls
from the sky is beautiful.</b>

618
00:54:42,121 --> 00:54:45,058
<b>It's beautiful,
but the cherry blossom will fall.</b>

619
00:54:46,026 --> 00:54:48,458
<b>Did you see the big cherry blossom
tree in front of the NFS?</b>

620
00:54:49,336 --> 00:54:51,932
<b>I really wanted to take a picture
this spring.</b>

621
00:54:53,340 --> 00:54:55,396
<b>That tree fades the latest.</b>

622
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:57,207
<b>Pardon?</b>

623
00:54:57,231 --> 00:54:59,635
<b>I said that the tree fades
at the latest.</b>

624
00:55:01,176 --> 00:55:03,684
<b>Do you like cherry blossoms?</b>

625
00:55:13,036 --> 00:55:14,833
<b>Wait here while I get the car.</b>

626
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:20,395
<b>I got...</b>

627
00:55:20,645 --> 00:55:23,762
<b>a heart transplant
from a death-row convict.</b>

628
00:55:24,304 --> 00:55:28,335
<b>Maybe that's why my heart pounds
in fear whenever I see you.</b>

629
00:55:30,670 --> 00:55:34,150
<b>But I get confused sometimes
whether my heart is pounding...</b>

630
00:55:34,174 --> 00:55:36,747
<b>because of my feelings
or because of him.</b>

631
00:55:38,262 --> 00:55:41,426
<b>Can I hold your hand just once?</b>

632
00:55:42,004 --> 00:55:45,652
<b>I want to know whether it's pounding
because of me or him.</b>

633
00:55:46,478 --> 00:55:47,997
<b>Frankly speaking,</b>

634
00:55:48,021 --> 00:55:51,258
<b>my heart was pounding
since the first time I saw you.</b>

635
00:55:51,723 --> 00:55:52,801
<b>Pardon?</b>

636
00:56:05,379 --> 00:56:07,841
<b>Why? Wasn't it enough?</b>

637
00:56:08,981 --> 00:56:10,710
<b>Can I do something else
if it's not enough?</b>

638
00:56:35,559 --> 00:56:38,572
<b>You're a medical school professor.
Don't you have experiment ethics?</b>

639
00:56:39,778 --> 00:56:42,909
<b>I'm a bit...</b>

640
00:56:43,613 --> 00:56:45,473
<b>It's not like
there's something wrong with me,</b>

641
00:56:45,498 --> 00:56:47,833
<b>but why does my heart pound
whenever I see you?</b>

642
00:56:47,981 --> 00:56:50,980
<b>I've never felt my heart pounding
in my life...</b>

643
00:56:51,004 --> 00:56:52,170
<b>because of a man.</b>

644
00:56:52,194 --> 00:56:56,156
<b>I may have a strong sense
of experimentation.</b>

645
00:57:13,558 --> 00:57:14,558
<b>(internal medicine)</b>

646
00:58:01,981 --> 00:58:05,025
<b>It was the first day
I felt someone else's pain.</b>

647
00:58:06,292 --> 00:58:07,394
<b>And...</b>

648
00:58:34,316 --> 00:58:35,597
<b>This is crazy.</b>

649
00:59:05,902 --> 00:59:08,497
<b>I've developed feelings
for this woman...</b>

650
00:59:09,621 --> 00:59:11,191
<b>who has accepted my dark side.</b>

651
00:59:46,493 --> 00:59:47,928
<b>(Born Again)</b>

652
00:59:50,105 --> 00:59:51,097
<b>I see it.</b>

653
00:59:51,121 --> 00:59:54,613
<b>You see other people's wounds,
but you don't seem to see yours.</b>

654
00:59:54,775 --> 00:59:57,303
<b>I'm happy I didn't make you regret.</b>

655
00:59:57,328 --> 01:00:00,340
<b>You shouldn't get hurt
because I like you.</b>

656
01:00:01,207 --> 01:00:04,477
<b>Love? If you give it
yet you don't get it back,</b>

657
01:00:04,609 --> 01:00:06,513
<b>your love becomes an obsession.</b>

658
01:00:06,926 --> 01:00:09,249
<b>Cain became the first murderer
of the human race.</b>

659
01:00:12,445 --> 01:00:14,257
<b>Oh, no. Prosecutor!</b>
