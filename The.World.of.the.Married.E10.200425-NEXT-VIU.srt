<b>Let me go.</b>

3
00:01:06,992 --> 00:01:09,393
<b>I can't do that. I already saw what you did.</b>

4
00:01:11,293 --> 00:01:12,332
<b>I said let me go.</b>

5
00:01:12,332 --> 00:01:14,033
<b>Can you tell me why you did this?</b>

6
00:01:14,033 --> 00:01:15,332
<b>Why do you care?</b>

7
00:01:16,102 --> 00:01:17,332
<b>What's going on?</b>

8
00:01:19,832 --> 00:01:22,343
<b>- Is this your car, sir? - Yes.</b>

9
00:01:26,472 --> 00:01:29,143
<b>Hey, aren't you Dr. Ji's son?</b>

10
00:01:33,683 --> 00:01:35,423
<b>- Hey, wait... - It's okay.</b>

11
00:01:36,582 --> 00:01:37,653
<b>Don't bother.</b>

12
00:01:38,552 --> 00:01:39,623
<b>Excuse me.</b>

13
00:01:41,623 --> 00:01:42,722
<b>But may I ask who you are?</b>

14
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:48,763
<b>What kind of emotion do you think is left between those two?</b>

15
00:01:49,302 --> 00:01:50,802
<b>Hatred? Resentment?</b>

16
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:53,433
<b>Is it something along those lines?</b>

17
00:01:53,972 --> 00:01:57,373
<b>It could be an obsession, pity,</b>

18
00:01:57,912 --> 00:01:59,612
<b>or affection.</b>

19
00:01:59,813 --> 00:02:01,082
<b>But I can't quite tell yet.</b>

20
00:02:02,082 --> 00:02:06,313
<b>One person needs to break down in order for it to be clear.</b>

21
00:02:07,483 --> 00:02:09,322
<b>If there's any flame left,</b>

22
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:13,153
<b>we should pour more gasoline to check.</b>

23
00:02:14,363 --> 00:02:17,363
<b>I just want my daughter to be happy.</b>

24
00:02:17,792 --> 00:02:19,792
<b>Must you really see this through?</b>

25
00:02:21,662 --> 00:02:24,102
<b>Even though you don't know what might happen?</b>

26
00:02:24,672 --> 00:02:27,003
<b>Don't you also want to check?</b>

27
00:02:28,403 --> 00:02:31,773
<b>From what I know, you're very fond of Dr. Ji.</b>

28
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:36,382
<b>You're mistaken.</b>

29
00:02:38,613 --> 00:02:40,852
<b>I don't have any personal feelings for her.</b>

30
00:02:41,253 --> 00:02:43,222
<b>All I did was make her feel comfortable around me...</b>

31
00:02:43,322 --> 00:02:45,493
<b>so she would engage more in counseling.</b>

32
00:02:48,993 --> 00:02:50,093
<b>That's quite unexpected.</b>

33
00:02:50,692 --> 00:02:54,403
<b>That's how I can find out what she's really thinking.</b>

34
00:03:07,412 --> 00:03:10,642
<b>Do you know how it feels to loathe someone?</b>

35
00:03:11,253 --> 00:03:14,253
<b>You just can't stand seeing that person around you.</b>

36
00:03:14,352 --> 00:03:16,053
<b>Either that person needs to die, or you need to die.</b>

37
00:03:16,722 --> 00:03:18,892
<b>One person needs to disappear in order for the hatred to end.</b>

38
00:03:19,322 --> 00:03:21,892
<b>I don't know about others, but I know exactly what you mean.</b>

39
00:03:23,292 --> 00:03:24,662
<b>What you're feeling right now...</b>

40
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:28,033
<b>is love.</b>

41
00:03:28,632 --> 00:03:29,702
<b>Shut your mouth.</b>

42
00:03:31,373 --> 00:03:35,843
<b>Do you think I'm anything like you?</b>

43
00:04:02,102 --> 00:04:04,132
<b>Dad, how do I look?</b>

44
00:04:04,403 --> 00:04:06,533
<b>Son, you look amazing.</b>

45
00:04:06,732 --> 00:04:09,102
<b>Gosh, who do you take after?</b>

46
00:04:09,102 --> 00:04:10,202
<b>I take after Mom.</b>

47
00:04:11,873 --> 00:04:13,012
<b>Mom's here.</b>

48
00:04:13,713 --> 00:04:17,113
<b>- You look beautiful. - You're so pretty.</b>

49
00:04:19,853 --> 00:04:21,223
<b>I'm one lucky guy.</b>

50
00:04:23,282 --> 00:04:24,282
<b>My goodness.</b>

51
00:04:25,553 --> 00:04:27,522
<b>Okay, let's start the shoot.</b>

52
00:04:27,762 --> 00:04:30,563
<b>- Isn't she gorgeous? - Gosh, stop it.</b>

53
00:04:30,723 --> 00:04:33,332
<b>What? It's true. You're beautiful.</b>

54
00:04:34,092 --> 00:04:36,863
<b>Gosh, you're being so corny. Stop it, Dad.</b>

55
00:04:36,863 --> 00:04:39,233
<b>Okay, fine. My goodness.</b>

56
00:04:40,933 --> 00:04:43,072
<b>But seriously. You look really pretty.</b>

57
00:04:51,613 --> 00:04:52,753
<b>What are you doing here again?</b>

58
00:04:59,392 --> 00:05:00,592
<b>Where do you think you're going?</b>

59
00:05:01,993 --> 00:05:03,563
<b>If you have something to say, we can talk outside.</b>

60
00:05:22,413 --> 00:05:23,782
<b>Is it okay...</b>

61
00:05:25,113 --> 00:05:27,253
<b>if your wife finds out that you keep coming here?</b>

62
00:05:27,712 --> 00:05:29,923
<b>How long are you going to harass me like this?</b>

63
00:05:32,253 --> 00:05:34,793
<b>All I want is to live comfortably in my hometown.</b>

64
00:05:34,793 --> 00:05:36,123
<b>Is that too much to ask?</b>

65
00:05:36,123 --> 00:05:37,723
<b>That's what I want to ask.</b>

66
00:05:38,032 --> 00:05:39,962
<b>You're the one who's harassing me.</b>

67
00:05:53,442 --> 00:05:54,683
<b>What were you watching?</b>

68
00:05:58,212 --> 00:05:59,712
<b>You're the best.</b>

69
00:06:02,282 --> 00:06:03,322
<b>I love you.</b>

70
00:06:22,272 --> 00:06:23,642
<b>Did you not throw this away yet?</b>

71
00:06:24,072 --> 00:06:25,873
<b>Do you watch it whenever you can?</b>

72
00:06:27,473 --> 00:06:28,543
<b>Don't tell me...</b>

73
00:06:29,882 --> 00:06:32,582
<b>you were hoping I'd come back to you.</b>

74
00:06:35,753 --> 00:06:38,022
<b>Just the sight of you makes me uncontrollably angry.</b>

75
00:06:39,623 --> 00:06:41,053
<b>Thanks to you, I have a prior for assault...</b>

76
00:06:41,053 --> 00:06:44,022
<b>and had a restraining order keeping me from my only son!</b>

77
00:06:44,733 --> 00:06:46,392
<b>It still makes my blood boil.</b>

78
00:06:47,902 --> 00:06:50,303
<b>What are you imagining about me?</b>

79
00:06:51,233 --> 00:06:53,532
<b>And what are you expecting from me by coming here...</b>

80
00:06:55,603 --> 00:06:56,873
<b>at this hour?</b>

81
00:07:03,142 --> 00:07:04,782
<b>Just be honest.</b>

82
00:07:05,782 --> 00:07:08,582
<b>Ask. Beg. Tell me what you want from me.</b>

83
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:24,632
<b>Although that won't change anything.</b>

84
00:07:30,003 --> 00:07:31,642
<b>I don't know what I may do...</b>

85
00:07:34,043 --> 00:07:36,043
<b>if you keep resisting.</b>

86
00:07:38,452 --> 00:07:39,782
<b>So I beg you...</b>

87
00:07:45,692 --> 00:07:47,392
<b>please disappear from my life.</b>

88
00:07:52,092 --> 00:07:53,663
<b>I'll be fine if you're gone.</b>

89

<b>Look at these pictures.</b>

93
00:08:27,032 --> 00:08:29,663
<b>We're perfect, don't you think?</b>

94
00:08:31,433 --> 00:08:32,603
<b>Without you,</b>

<b>(A World of Married Couple)</b>

<b>I'm glad you're here. Good thinking.</b>

98

<b>Our success rate is just as high as most hospitals in Seoul.</b>

99

<b>It isn't too late, is it?</b>

100
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:07,302
<b>Obviously, it's not early.</b>

101
00:09:08,142 --> 00:09:10,943
<b>We'll know the details once we run some tests,</b>

102

<b>but we have a pretty good success rate with harder cases.</b>

<b>You know stress decreases your chances, right?</b>

104
00:09:23,922 --> 00:09:26,922
<b>First, shall we begin with the basic tests?</b>

105
00:09:27,093 --> 00:09:28,193
<b>Sure.</b>

106
00:09:36,003 --> 00:09:37,603
<b>How long must we wait?</b>

107
00:09:37,662 --> 00:09:40,973
<b>My appointment was for a while ago. Why won't you check?</b>

<b>I have a dentist appointment.</b>

<b>- I don't have time. - What's going on?</b>

<b>I was late because I wasn't feeling well this morning.</b>

<b>I understand. It's because you have a lot on your mind.</b>

<b>I'll be careful.</b>

<b>Why are you staring at me? Do you need to say something?</b>

139

<b>I thought it over, and I think you're right.</b>

140
00:11:37,382 --> 00:11:39,693
<b>What matters most to me right now is Joon Young.</b>

141
00:11:40,453 --> 00:11:41,693
<b>Which gets me to my point.</b>

142

<b>What do you think about being the associate director?</b>

<b>If you'd take on the role,</b>

<b>I'd be able to step down without worry.</b>

<b>I like things the way they are.</b>

146

<b>It wouldn't help the hospital much.</b>

<b>Someone who's more zealous than I am should do it.</b>

148

<b>Are you really not interested?</b>

149
00:12:13,152 --> 00:12:14,863
<b>No, I'm not.</b>

150
00:12:30,272 --> 00:12:31,402
<b>Is everything okay?</b>

151
00:12:31,843 --> 00:12:33,343
<b>There are a few more to go.</b>

152

<b>Maybe we should've come sooner.</b>

153

<b>You would've worried less then.</b>

154

<b>It's okay. I'm not worried.</b>

155
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:44,782
<b>Even if we can't get pregnant...</b>

156
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:50,062
<b>I'll be grateful to you.</b>

157
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:57,603
<b>Mr. Son Je Hyuk, come in.</b>

158
00:12:58,432 --> 00:12:59,632
<b>I'll be quick.</b>

159
00:13:58,162 --> 00:14:00,132
<b>- Have a nice day. - Thank you.</b>

160
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:22,723
<b>(Phone, Min Hyun Seo)</b>

161
00:14:33,162 --> 00:14:36,162
<b>The person you have reached is not available.</b>

162
00:14:38,132 --> 00:14:39,233
<b>Hyun Seo.</b>

163
00:14:40,103 --> 00:14:42,642
<b>I'm worried, so please text me at least.</b>

164
00:14:42,672 --> 00:14:45,012
<b>(Hyun Seo. I'm worried, so please text me at least.)</b>

165
00:14:59,723 --> 00:15:01,152
<b>I'm stepping out for an hour.</b>

166
00:15:01,152 --> 00:15:02,422
<b>Adjust my appointments for me.</b>

167
00:15:02,863 --> 00:15:03,993
<b>- Sorry? - Sorry?</b>

168
00:15:06,392 --> 00:15:09,062
<b>Why does she have so many personal matters?</b>

169
00:15:09,603 --> 00:15:11,833
<b>Women can never keep their personal lives...</b>

170
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:14,073
<b>out of the workplace when anything happens.</b>

171
00:15:14,573 --> 00:15:16,302
<b>Seriously.</b>

172
00:15:16,443 --> 00:15:18,642
<b>- Oh my gosh. - You don't mean "women",</b>

173
00:15:18,843 --> 00:15:20,772
<b>but Sun Woo.</b>

174
00:15:21,373 --> 00:15:25,253
<b>It's unfair if you lump us all together.</b>

175
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:36,863
<b>- Please wait a few minutes. - Okay.</b>

176
00:15:47,373 --> 00:15:48,802
<b>Ms. Ko Ye Rim.</b>

177
00:15:49,672 --> 00:15:52,873
<b>They're ready for Ms. Ko Ye Rim. Did she go somewhere?</b>

178
00:15:52,973 --> 00:15:54,243
<b>I'll look for her.</b>

179
00:16:28,243 --> 00:16:30,083
<b>I told you not to come looking for me.</b>

180
00:16:30,882 --> 00:16:31,983
<b>You met with Park In Kyu,</b>

181
00:16:33,152 --> 00:16:34,253
<b>didn't you?</b>

182
00:16:35,823 --> 00:16:37,253
<b>Don't try to fool me.</b>

183
00:16:42,823 --> 00:16:44,562
<b>I changed my number...</b>

184
00:16:45,062 --> 00:16:46,562
<b>and tried to hide.</b>

185
00:16:47,792 --> 00:16:49,802
<b>Somehow he found me again and showed up.</b>

186
00:16:52,973 --> 00:16:53,973
<b>Hyun Seo.</b>

187
00:16:55,542 --> 00:16:56,973
<b>Do you need me to help you?</b>

188
00:17:03,542 --> 00:17:06,753
<b>He can't find out I'm seeing you.</b>

189
00:17:08,852 --> 00:17:10,052
<b>Hurry and leave.</b>

190
00:17:10,782 --> 00:17:12,792
<b>Also, don't ever come looking for me again.</b>

191
00:17:26,572 --> 00:17:28,673
<b>I thought you were going to the washroom. What are you doing?</b>

192
00:17:32,473 --> 00:17:34,572
<b>Who is that? Is that Dr. Ji?</b>

193
00:17:35,483 --> 00:17:36,643
<b>What brought her here?</b>

194
00:17:38,552 --> 00:17:39,953
<b>Is it her day off?</b>

195
00:17:44,383 --> 00:17:47,423
<b>What was that? Is she going to ignore us now?</b>

196
00:17:51,463 --> 00:17:52,592
<b>Sure.</b>

197
00:17:53,362 --> 00:17:56,163
<b>We can meet there before we head over to Da Kyung's together.</b>

198
00:17:56,802 --> 00:17:59,332
<b>Okay. Bye now.</b>

199
00:18:01,602 --> 00:18:05,342
<b>Your dad cannot go a day without seeing Jenny.</b>

200
00:18:06,772 --> 00:18:09,512
<b>We better ask your helper to prepare dinner.</b>

201
00:18:09,983 --> 00:18:12,612
<b>I should call Tae Oh to come home early too.</b>

202
00:18:12,683 --> 00:18:13,683
<b>Okay.</b>

203
00:18:13,683 --> 00:18:15,983
<b>We'll escort you to the massage room.</b>

204
00:18:18,483 --> 00:18:20,723
<b>This person asked for you, Hyun Seo.</b>

205
00:18:21,223 --> 00:18:22,423
<b>- Hey, - Yes?</b>

206
00:18:22,423 --> 00:18:23,522
<b>- you lost weight. - Yes.</b>

207
00:18:23,522 --> 00:18:26,792
<b>Don't go on a diet. Please give me a strong massage today.</b>

208
00:18:26,792 --> 00:18:27,832
<b>I need a strong one.</b>

209
00:18:47,612 --> 00:18:48,983
<b>Aren't you going to escort me?</b>

210
00:18:52,753 --> 00:18:53,923
<b>Please follow me.</b>

211
00:20:21,272 --> 00:20:22,743
<b>- Did you try calling? - Yes.</b>

212
00:20:22,743 --> 00:20:24,413
<b>- Did you look everywhere? - Yes.</b>

213
00:20:24,913 --> 00:20:26,753
<b>Where did she go?</b>

214
00:20:26,753 --> 00:20:27,883
<b>What's the matter?</b>

215
00:20:28,653 --> 00:20:29,883
<b>Did something happen?</b>

216
00:20:30,423 --> 00:20:31,552
<b>Well...</b>

217
00:20:37,062 --> 00:20:38,963
<b>It's Je Hyuk and Ye Rim.</b>

218
00:20:39,292 --> 00:20:42,262
<b>They came to get consultation and tests done for infertility.</b>

219
00:20:42,262 --> 00:20:45,772
<b>Then Ye Rim suddenly disappeared without a word.</b>

220
00:20:46,633 --> 00:20:47,802
<b>She disappeared suddenly?</b>

221
00:20:55,413 --> 00:20:57,582
<b>Gosh, she won't pick up.</b>

222
00:21:07,792 --> 00:21:09,423
<b>Where did she go?</b>

223
00:21:11,963 --> 00:21:13,993
<b>- What is it? - What are you doing?</b>

224
00:21:14,993 --> 00:21:16,332
<b>If you're free, do you want to grab some drinks?</b>

225
00:21:17,133 --> 00:21:19,633
<b>No, not today.</b>

226
00:21:21,032 --> 00:21:22,203
<b>Why not? Are you busy?</b>

227
00:21:25,643 --> 00:21:27,913
<b>I'm a little dazed right now.</b>

228
00:21:28,342 --> 00:21:29,512
<b>Let's talk later.</b>

229
00:21:53,673 --> 00:21:54,832
<b>Good work.</b>

230
00:21:55,403 --> 00:21:57,072
<b>Since when did you start working here?</b>

231
00:22:04,943 --> 00:22:07,753
<b>Were you still in contact with Ji Sun Woo?</b>

232
00:22:09,622 --> 00:22:11,352
<b>Did she tell you...</b>

233
00:22:12,322 --> 00:22:13,693
<b>I'm a member here?</b>

234
00:22:16,223 --> 00:22:18,393
<b>I worked here for a bit over a year.</b>

235
00:22:19,332 --> 00:22:21,663
<b>It took me a while to get my license.</b>

236
00:22:23,332 --> 00:22:25,772
<b>I heard recently that you moved back to Gosan.</b>

237
00:22:28,072 --> 00:22:30,342
<b>I didn't think I'd run into you here.</b>

238
00:22:32,003 --> 00:22:33,842
<b>Do you still report to her...</b>

239
00:22:35,483 --> 00:22:37,413
<b>about what I do?</b>

240
00:22:40,413 --> 00:22:41,552
<b>Are you nervous?</b>

241
00:22:46,292 --> 00:22:47,322
<b>No.</b>

242
00:22:49,062 --> 00:22:50,062
<b>Why?</b>

243
00:22:50,923 --> 00:22:52,693
<b>I heard you got married,</b>

244
00:22:54,362 --> 00:22:56,463
<b>but you don't look happy for some reason.</b>

245
00:22:58,633 --> 00:22:59,703
<b>I guess I can understand.</b>

246
00:23:00,633 --> 00:23:02,403
<b>A man who cheated once...</b>

247
00:23:03,542 --> 00:23:05,072
<b>will most likely cheat again.</b>

248
00:23:18,893 --> 00:23:20,552
<b>"And some very big snakes..."</b>

249
00:23:20,552 --> 00:23:22,993
<b>"and meat-eating fish live in the river."</b>

250
00:23:24,122 --> 00:23:25,463
<b>That's it for today's class.</b>

251
00:23:25,463 --> 00:23:27,262
<b>Now everybody, don't forget about your homework...</b>

252
00:23:27,262 --> 00:23:28,393
<b>that's due tomorrow.</b>

253
00:23:28,393 --> 00:23:31,733
<b>That's a one-page essay on the Amazon. All right?</b>

254
00:23:33,673 --> 00:23:37,173
<b>I'm not taking anything late, so make sure you do it. Okay?</b>

255
00:23:37,503 --> 00:23:38,943
<b>Everybody, have a nice day.</b>

256
00:23:38,943 --> 00:23:42,072
<b>- Have a nice day. - Have a nice day.</b>

257
00:23:45,012 --> 00:23:47,052
<b>(Yoon No Eul)</b>

258
00:23:57,193 --> 00:23:59,862
<b>Lee Joon Young, I need to talk to you.</b>

259
00:24:03,133 --> 00:24:04,133
<b>What?</b>

260
00:24:06,072 --> 00:24:07,403
<b>Are they dating?</b>

261
00:24:08,673 --> 00:24:09,772
<b>Maybe they really are.</b>

262
00:24:13,072 --> 00:24:14,812
<b>- What's going on? - What is this?</b>

263
00:24:14,812 --> 00:24:15,943
<b>Are you two dating?</b>

264
00:24:18,683 --> 00:24:19,883
<b>Did you see that?</b>

265
00:24:20,713 --> 00:24:22,622
<b>Will they become the first couple in our class?</b>

266
00:24:23,052 --> 00:24:26,352
<b>Why do you care if I steal and do stupid things?</b>

267
00:24:26,693 --> 00:24:27,923
<b>What you're doing...</b>

268
00:24:28,822 --> 00:24:30,022
<b>has lots to do with me.</b>

269
00:24:30,993 --> 00:24:33,633
<b>You shouldn't do that even if other people do it.</b>

270
00:24:33,993 --> 00:24:36,233
<b>You should tell Hae Kang the truth...</b>

271
00:24:37,233 --> 00:24:38,933
<b>and promise you'll never do it again.</b>

272
00:24:41,532 --> 00:24:43,602
<b>Just go and tell him I stole it.</b>

273
00:24:44,403 --> 00:24:46,612
<b>I don't care, so do what you want.</b>

274
00:24:48,772 --> 00:24:49,812
<b>Hey.</b>

275
00:24:51,012 --> 00:24:52,112
<b>Darn it.</b>

276
00:24:56,322 --> 00:24:57,852
<b>It's because of people like you...</b>

277
00:24:58,923 --> 00:25:00,552
<b>I get blamed too.</b>

278
00:25:01,653 --> 00:25:03,622
<b>Because of troublemakers like you,</b>

279
00:25:04,193 --> 00:25:06,592
<b>kids of divorced parents are criticized.</b>

280
00:25:09,733 --> 00:25:11,503
<b>Do you have to make it that obvious?</b>

281
00:25:30,622 --> 00:25:31,622
<b>Lee Joon Young.</b>

282
00:25:34,352 --> 00:25:35,393
<b>Do you...</b>

283
00:25:37,423 --> 00:25:38,822
<b>have something going on with Yoon No Eul?</b>

284
00:25:40,163 --> 00:25:41,393
<b>No way.</b>

285
00:25:41,393 --> 00:25:43,562
<b>Are you two really dating?</b>

286
00:25:43,703 --> 00:25:44,832
<b>Are you crazy?</b>

287
00:25:45,532 --> 00:25:46,703
<b>Then can you help me?</b>

288
00:25:47,872 --> 00:25:51,003
<b>I like her. Can you help me?</b>

289
00:25:51,503 --> 00:25:53,272
<b>You're closer to her than I am.</b>

290
00:25:57,282 --> 00:25:58,713
<b>Jenny is making me curry.</b>

291
00:26:00,483 --> 00:26:04,022
<b>Of course, I came home early since your parents are coming.</b>

292
00:26:04,352 --> 00:26:05,453
<b>Where are you?</b>

293

<b>I'm almost home, and my parents will arrive soon.</b>

294

<b>I'll see you soon.</b>

295
00:26:14,233 --> 00:26:15,292
<b>Okay.</b>

296
00:26:18,302 --> 00:26:20,403
<b>Jenny, your mom is almost here.</b>

297
00:26:22,302 --> 00:26:24,602
<b>Make me curry. I'm starving.</b>

298
00:26:25,042 --> 00:26:28,173
<b>Yum. Yum.</b>

299
00:26:28,943 --> 00:26:31,883
<b>What? That can't be your mom.</b>

300
00:26:32,413 --> 00:26:34,082
<b>Let's go see who's here.</b>

301
00:26:34,282 --> 00:26:35,723
<b>Come on.</b>

302
00:26:42,522 --> 00:26:45,733
<b>(Front door)</b>

<b>(Front door)</b>

304
00:27:27,403 --> 00:27:29,003
<b>Did he pick up or not?</b>

305
00:27:33,443 --> 00:27:34,643
<b>What are you doing here?</b>

306
00:27:36,143 --> 00:27:37,383
<b>How dare you come here?</b>

<b>I'm also sick and tired of doing this.</b>

<b>So hurry up and give me what you promised.</b>

310

<b>Okay?</b>

311

<b>Was someone here?</b>

316
00:29:27,993 --> 00:29:31,163
<b>Yes, he wanted me to subscribe to a newspaper, and I said no.</b>

317
00:29:32,062 --> 00:29:35,062
<b>Who reads newspapers these days? He's wasting his time.</b>

318
00:29:35,292 --> 00:29:36,403
<b>Right, honey?</b>

319
00:29:38,832 --> 00:29:40,173
<b>I'm going to get changed.</b>

320
00:29:41,233 --> 00:29:42,302
<b>Okay.</b>

321
00:29:56,983 --> 00:29:59,693
<b>My goodness, look at her eating chicken.</b>

322
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:01,653
<b>She eats so well.</b>

323
00:30:02,493 --> 00:30:03,562
<b>Look at you.</b>

324
00:30:04,762 --> 00:30:07,562
<b>Have another sip of water. Drink it slowly.</b>

325
00:30:08,062 --> 00:30:09,332
<b>There we go.</b>

326
00:30:09,862 --> 00:30:12,133
<b>Da Kyung, you should eat, too.</b>

327
00:30:13,003 --> 00:30:14,102
<b>Okay.</b>

328
00:30:17,572 --> 00:30:19,173
<b>- Do you need something? - No.</b>

329
00:30:19,512 --> 00:30:23,342
<b>I'll look after Jenny. You should eat comfortably.</b>

330
00:30:24,483 --> 00:30:27,753
<b>Jenny, let's eat outside so your mommy can eat.</b>

331
00:30:27,753 --> 00:30:29,552
<b>- Come on. - Go on.</b>

332
00:30:30,582 --> 00:30:31,683
<b>- There we go. - My goodness.</b>

333
00:30:31,983 --> 00:30:34,622
<b>Your dad never helped me look after you.</b>

334
00:30:34,993 --> 00:30:37,493
<b>Tae Oh is very considerate when it comes to stuff like this.</b>

335
00:30:38,393 --> 00:30:40,332
<b>- Enjoy your meal. - Okay.</b>

336
00:30:40,733 --> 00:30:43,003
<b>Jenny, let's go play.</b>

337
00:30:43,933 --> 00:30:45,163
<b>Come on.</b>

338
00:30:45,163 --> 00:30:47,703
<b>- She's adorable. Look at her. - This way?</b>

339
00:30:47,802 --> 00:30:49,102
<b>Let's go.</b>

340
00:31:04,423 --> 00:31:06,193
<b>About Tae Oh...</b>

341
00:31:07,493 --> 00:31:10,993
<b>It looks like he still keeps in touch with Dr. Ji.</b>

342
00:31:12,993 --> 00:31:14,393
<b>Yes, I know.</b>

343
00:31:15,362 --> 00:31:17,362
<b>Tae Oh tells me everything.</b>

344
00:31:17,933 --> 00:31:20,973
<b>He always tells me what it's about.</b>

345
00:31:22,703 --> 00:31:24,203
<b>And that doesn't bother you?</b>

346
00:31:25,443 --> 00:31:28,173
<b>Their son lives with her, so I should understand.</b>

347
00:31:28,943 --> 00:31:31,743
<b>I expected that much when we decided to move back here.</b>

348
00:31:35,082 --> 00:31:36,223
<b>What is it?</b>

349
00:31:37,253 --> 00:31:39,022
<b>Are you worried because of her?</b>

350
00:31:42,253 --> 00:31:43,792
<b>I'm not bothered by her.</b>

351
00:31:45,062 --> 00:31:46,663
<b>So you shouldn't be bothered by her either.</b>

352
00:31:48,163 --> 00:31:50,903
<b>I trust Tae Oh, and things are fine between us.</b>

353
00:31:53,832 --> 00:31:57,602
<b>Do you remember what I told you when I let you marry him?</b>

354
00:31:59,443 --> 00:32:03,542
<b>I told you that you're always free to come back if you're not happy.</b>

355
00:32:08,713 --> 00:32:11,582
<b>Yes, of course. I remember.</b>

356
00:32:19,393 --> 00:32:20,532
<b>Dad.</b>

357
00:32:21,832 --> 00:32:23,433
<b>You know I love you, right?</b>

358
00:32:24,933 --> 00:32:26,072
<b>No, not really.</b>

<b>I'm sorry to call you at such a late hour.</b>

361

<b>Can you withdraw 10,000 dollars in cash...</b>

362

<b>from the emergency fund tomorrow?</b>

<b>Yes.</b>

00:33:21,453 --> 00:33:22,723
<b>Have it ready before you get off work.</b>

365
00:33:53,193 --> 00:33:54,622
<b>Would you also like a glass?</b>

366
00:33:55,653 --> 00:33:56,762
<b>Sure.</b>

367
00:34:24,182 --> 00:34:25,323
<b>Someone told me...</b>

368

<b>that once a cheater is always a cheater.</b>

369

<b>I bet you've also heard of that.</b>

370

<b>Does that...</b>

<b>How about you?</b>

373

<b>What we had wasn't just a fling.</b>

<b>It doesn't matter what people say.</b>

<b>We both know they're wrong.</b>

376

<b>Don't let them hurt you like that.</b>

377

<b>It hurts to see you upset like this.</b>

<b>You're right.</b>

379

<b>I was always proud of our love.</b>

380

<b>But why now?</b>

381
00:35:35,122 --> 00:35:36,963
<b>We're even married now.</b>

382
00:35:40,162 --> 00:35:43,332
<b>So I don't get why I'm so bothered by that saying.</b>

383
00:35:47,602 --> 00:35:49,173
<b>I don't care what other people say.</b>

384

<b>It's just that I can't stop thinking about it.</b>

385

<b>Will you be named the associate director soon?</b>

<b>Where did you hear that?</b>

404

<b>It's our job to visit hospitals.</b>

00:45:18,330 --> 00:45:20,060
<b>doesn't belong near my daughter.</b>

473
00:45:23,330 --> 00:45:27,200
<b>With this, I no longer have a line I cannot cross either.</b>

474
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:30,410
<b>Since I must protect my son and myself.</b>

475
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:36,410
<b>You know Gosan is in the palm of my hand.</b>

476
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:41,180
<b>It would be best for you to do as I say.</b>

477
00:46:00,170 --> 00:46:02,870
<b>- Dr. Ji. - Hello, ma'am.</b>

478
00:46:03,140 --> 00:46:04,440
<b>What brings you here?</b>

479
00:46:04,810 --> 00:46:06,670
<b>You're clearly not here to golf.</b>

480
00:46:07,540 --> 00:46:09,410
<b>I came to see someone.</b>

481
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:12,410
<b>I heard the news from Dr. Kong.</b>

482
00:46:13,250 --> 00:46:15,780
<b>I heard you're resigning from your associate director position.</b>

483
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:18,720
<b>Yes.</b>

484
00:46:20,990 --> 00:46:22,190
<b>I'll get going.</b>

485
00:46:22,190 --> 00:46:25,560
<b>I feel sorry for you since you had to leave after working so hard,</b>

486
00:46:26,590 --> 00:46:29,600
<b>but you should let work stay at work.</b>

487
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:33,400
<b>It doesn't look good for him...</b>

488
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:35,270
<b>to be seen with a divorced woman at a bar late at night.</b>

489
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:38,340
<b>It could damage his dignity.</b>

490
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:40,340
<b>People might think it's indecent,</b>

491
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:43,140
<b>and I feel humiliated by it too.</b>

492
00:47:11,610 --> 00:47:13,980
<b>He withdrew 10,000 dollars in cash from the emergency fund.</b>

493
00:47:15,140 --> 00:47:16,280
<b>How much is it in total?</b>

494
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:18,080
<b>Up to now, he took 40,000 dollars.</b>

495
00:47:43,370 --> 00:47:46,270
<b>The person you have reached is not available.</b>

496
00:47:46,270 --> 00:47:47,510
<b>(Wifey)</b>

497
00:47:47,510 --> 00:47:49,010
<b>(Where are you? What's wrong?)</b>

498
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:51,680
<b>At least tell me the reason.</b>

499
00:47:52,180 --> 00:47:53,250
<b>Why are you...</b>

500
00:47:55,580 --> 00:47:57,920
<b>(At least tell me the reason. Why are you...)</b>

501
00:48:04,930 --> 00:48:09,630
<b>(Wifey)</b>

502
00:48:12,030 --> 00:48:15,800
<b>The person you have reached is not available.</b>

503
00:48:25,650 --> 00:48:26,710
<b>Darn it.</b>

504
00:48:52,610 --> 00:48:55,410
<b>Joy. Where is Joy?</b>

505
00:48:56,740 --> 00:48:58,210
<b>She quit.</b>

506
00:48:58,280 --> 00:48:59,380
<b>She doesn't work here anymore.</b>

507
00:49:34,550 --> 00:49:35,650
<b>How...</b>

508
00:49:57,170 --> 00:49:58,640
<b>(Lee Tae Oh)</b>

509
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:11,090
<b>I told you to be good to your wife, didn't I?</b>

510
00:50:17,090 --> 00:50:18,390
<b>What are you talking about?</b>

511
00:50:20,930 --> 00:50:22,030
<b>Joy...</b>

512
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:24,930
<b>has a temper, doesn't she?</b>

513
00:50:27,340 --> 00:50:28,440
<b>What is this?</b>

514
00:50:30,740 --> 00:50:32,170
<b>Is this your doing?</b>

515
00:50:34,580 --> 00:50:36,840
<b>I didn't push you to do anything.</b>

516
00:50:37,350 --> 00:50:39,150
<b>She wanted to date,</b>

517
00:50:39,750 --> 00:50:42,550
<b>so I was reminded of you and gave her a tip.</b>

518
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:45,690
<b>I didn't think you'd fall for the trap so easily.</b>

519
00:50:46,590 --> 00:50:48,490
<b>Don't blame me for being a fool.</b>

520
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:51,760
<b>This happened...</b>

521
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:54,860
<b>because you're a jerk.</b>

522
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:55,190
<b>How do you know Chairman Yeo?</b>

523
00:51:59,290 --> 00:52:00,530
<b>Come inside to talk.</b>

524
00:52:11,870 --> 00:52:13,040
<b>Do you want some tea?</b>

525
00:52:13,470 --> 00:52:14,910
<b>I said, how do you know him?</b>

526
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:19,380
<b>- Did you eat dinner? - What did you conspire with him?</b>

527
00:52:22,150 --> 00:52:23,520
<b>He asked me for a favor,</b>

528
00:52:25,050 --> 00:52:26,390
<b>so I'm consulting him.</b>

529
00:52:31,930 --> 00:52:33,330
<b>What did he ask you for?</b>

530
00:52:35,730 --> 00:52:37,570
<b>Did he ask you to do a psychiatric evaluation on me?</b>

531
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:40,200
<b>Were you promised the associate director's position?</b>

532
00:52:41,670 --> 00:52:43,270
<b>How can you call yourself a doctor?</b>

533
00:52:43,270 --> 00:52:44,770
<b>This might sound strange,</b>

534
00:52:46,110 --> 00:52:47,840
<b>but I did it for you.</b>

535
00:52:54,850 --> 00:52:57,720
<b>I had to find out what Chairman Yeo was thinking.</b>

536
00:52:58,390 --> 00:53:00,620
<b>He's someone who can threaten you anytime.</b>

537
00:53:05,060 --> 00:53:06,230
<b>You're crazy.</b>

538
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:09,630
<b>Stop fighting them back when they provoke you.</b>

539
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:15,270
<b>How can you say that after stabbing me in the back?</b>

540
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:16,740
<b>I don't care about the position.</b>

541
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:18,340
<b>I'll step down when the time comes.</b>

542
00:53:19,140 --> 00:53:20,640
<b>It can't be helped at the moment...</b>

543
00:53:21,110 --> 00:53:22,540
<b>since I have to convince Chairman Yeo.</b>

544
00:53:24,380 --> 00:53:25,780
<b>I have to protect you.</b>

545
00:53:27,820 --> 00:53:28,920
<b>I believed you.</b>

546
00:53:32,490 --> 00:53:35,560
<b>That's why I showed everything inside me without hesitation.</b>

547
00:53:38,490 --> 00:53:39,930
<b>But how could you sell me off?</b>

548
00:53:41,430 --> 00:53:43,000
<b>You're not a doctor!</b>

549
00:53:46,570 --> 00:53:48,670
<b>Don't you ever get close to my son again.</b>

550
00:54:10,020 --> 00:54:11,260
<b>(Son)</b>

551
00:54:14,300 --> 00:54:15,500
<b>Yes, Joon Young.</b>

552
00:54:16,260 --> 00:54:17,330
<b>When are you coming home?</b>

553
00:54:17,730 --> 00:54:19,200
<b>I'm almost home.</b>

554
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:21,070
<b>Is everything okay?</b>

555
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:23,570
<b>I think something happened...</b>

556
00:54:24,570 --> 00:54:25,770
<b>at Ye Rim's house.</b>

557
00:54:29,010 --> 00:54:30,080
<b>Calm down.</b>

558
00:54:30,810 --> 00:54:32,910
<b>Please, listen to me.</b>

559
00:54:34,850 --> 00:54:37,350
<b>Ye Rim. Please, Ye Rim.</b>

560
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:39,050
<b>Why are they fighting?</b>

561
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:41,360
<b>- What's going on? - My goodness.</b>

562
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:42,420
<b>Please stop.</b>

563
00:54:43,060 --> 00:54:44,160
<b>Stop doing this.</b>

564
00:54:46,490 --> 00:54:47,600
<b>Please stop.</b>

565
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:51,170
<b>I think the man wronged her.</b>

566
00:55:01,710 --> 00:55:02,810
<b>Ye Rim.</b>

567
00:55:03,940 --> 00:55:06,910
<b>Please. Let's talk about it.</b>

568
00:55:07,420 --> 00:55:10,480
<b>I'll send the divorce papers to your office when they're ready.</b>

569
00:55:14,490 --> 00:55:15,590
<b>Honey.</b>

570
00:55:21,100 --> 00:55:22,200
<b>Honey.</b>

571
00:55:24,570 --> 00:55:25,600
<b>Honey.</b>

572
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:28,500
<b>Honey.</b>

573
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:33,510
<b>Ye Rim.</b>

574
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:39,350
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

575
00:55:44,090 --> 00:55:45,490
<b>I was out of my mind.</b>

576
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:49,220
<b>Please don't do this.</b>

577
00:55:50,260 --> 00:55:52,690
<b>Let's talk face to face.</b>

578
00:55:56,900 --> 00:55:58,000
<b>I'm sorry about everything...</b>

579
00:56:13,110 --> 00:56:14,620
<b>What's going on?</b>

580
00:56:16,550 --> 00:56:18,720
<b>What did you do to make her so angry?</b>

581
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:27,560
<b>It was Tae Oh.</b>

582
00:56:29,030 --> 00:56:30,330
<b>Tae Oh did this.</b>

583
00:56:33,070 --> 00:56:34,500
<b>I know what I did was wrong.</b>

584
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:37,100
<b>But it was a trap.</b>

585
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:40,240
<b>I fell for his trap.</b>

586
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:43,540
<b>What are you talking about? I don't get what you're saying.</b>

587
00:56:43,540 --> 00:56:44,610
<b>He was the one...</b>

588
00:56:46,010 --> 00:56:47,580
<b>who made her seduce me...</b>

589
00:56:47,750 --> 00:56:50,450
<b>and gave her Ye Rim's number so she could send her photos...</b>

590
00:56:50,990 --> 00:56:52,020
<b>of us in bed together.</b>

591
00:56:53,250 --> 00:56:55,120
<b>It was all part of his plan.</b>

592
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:05,230
<b>You never know what he might do to you.</b>

593
00:57:06,570 --> 00:57:07,870
<b>So you'd better be prepared.</b>

594
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:11,440
<b>If you don't want to be in my shoes, you'd better stay alert.</b>

595
00:57:12,570 --> 00:57:13,610
<b>That jerk...</b>

596
00:57:17,210 --> 00:57:18,280
<b>has gone nuts.</b>

597
00:57:25,350 --> 00:57:26,990
<b>I don't know what I may do...</b>

598
00:57:28,690 --> 00:57:30,620
<b>if you keep resisting.</b>

599
00:57:33,630 --> 00:57:34,830
<b>So I beg you...</b>

600
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:42,300
<b>please disappear from my life.</b>

601
00:58:16,300 --> 00:58:19,510
<b>What brings you here? You didn't even call.</b>

602
00:58:22,310 --> 00:58:23,510
<b>Today's your day off, isn't it?</b>

603
00:58:24,810 --> 00:58:25,850
<b>Let's go.</b>

604
00:58:28,580 --> 00:58:29,750
<b>Go where?</b>

605
00:58:30,650 --> 00:58:31,820
<b>You'll see.</b>

606
00:58:35,790 --> 00:58:36,790
<b>Come on.</b>

607
00:58:39,730 --> 00:58:40,790
<b>Careful.</b>

608
00:58:58,910 --> 00:59:01,950
<b>Pick one. Choose what you want.</b>

609
00:59:03,580 --> 00:59:04,750
<b>Okay.</b>

610
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:11,790
<b>They're all so pretty. I don't know which one to choose.</b>

611
00:59:19,070 --> 00:59:20,100
<b>How about this one?</b>

612
00:59:22,370 --> 00:59:25,040
<b>- Can we take a look at this one? - Sure. That's a great choice.</b>

613
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:26,070
<b>Yes.</b>

614
00:59:36,020 --> 00:59:38,190
<b>- Hyun Seo, give me your hand. - What?</b>

615
00:59:38,750 --> 00:59:41,660
<b>- Try it on. - Oh, okay.</b>

616
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:51,730
<b>What do you think?</b>

617
00:59:52,230 --> 00:59:54,600
<b>I think it's pretty. Do you like it?</b>

618
00:59:56,140 --> 00:59:58,210
<b>- Yes, it's pretty. - Right?</b>

619
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:03,410
<b>But it looks too expensive.</b>

620
01:00:08,180 --> 01:00:09,950
<b>(872 dollars, 1,102 dollars)</b>

621
01:00:11,550 --> 01:00:13,390
<b>We'll take this one.</b>

622
01:00:13,790 --> 01:00:14,860
<b>Okay.</b>

623
01:00:17,060 --> 01:00:19,290
<b>Do you know how much this costs?</b>

624
01:00:20,890 --> 01:00:22,900
<b>I can afford this much.</b>

625
01:00:24,260 --> 01:00:26,870
<b>After we check your size, you can come back for it in a week.</b>

626
01:00:27,530 --> 01:00:28,800
<b>- Just a second. - Okay.</b>

627
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:30,470
<b>Wait.</b>

628
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:33,540
<b>This is going to be our wedding ring.</b>

629

<b>Here are the test results.</b>

632
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:04,870
<b>Oh, dear. I was right. You have the flu.</b>

633
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:08,910
<b>I'll prescribe you some medicine. You should get some good rest.</b>

634
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:13,050
<b>No wonder I felt so tired and lethargic.</b>

635
01:01:13,250 --> 01:01:15,450
<b>Would you like an IV?</b>

636
01:01:15,450 --> 01:01:17,690
<b>No, it's not that bad.</b>

637
01:01:19,290 --> 01:01:20,320
<b>By the way,</b>

638
01:01:20,790 --> 01:01:23,120
<b>did you hear about Ye Rim and her husband?</b>

639
01:01:24,790 --> 01:01:27,360
<b>The entire neighborhood's been talking about them.</b>

640
01:01:28,260 --> 01:01:30,130
<b>She even put the house up for sale.</b>

641
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:34,870
<b>I guess she's going to get a divorce and leave Gosan.</b>

642
01:01:38,570 --> 01:01:39,810
<b>I didn't know that.</b>

643
01:01:40,610 --> 01:01:42,840
<b>Getting a divorce isn't always the right answer.</b>

644
01:01:43,710 --> 01:01:45,280
<b>Young people these days...</b>

645
01:01:45,910 --> 01:01:49,120
<b>think of divorce so easily.</b>

646
01:01:51,820 --> 01:01:54,620
<b>Maybe she finds it meaningless to hold onto a broken marriage.</b>

647
01:01:54,790 --> 01:01:57,520
<b>It's not easy to live as a divorced woman.</b>

648
01:01:58,030 --> 01:02:00,490
<b>People get suspicious the moment you have a drink...</b>

<b>with your boss outside of work.</b>

650
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:06,770
<b>People are still quite biased.</b>

651
01:02:07,230 --> 01:02:10,440
<b>I'm sure you know that better than anyone.</b>

652
01:02:52,380 --> 01:02:53,750
<b>Two years ago,</b>

653
01:02:57,120 --> 01:02:59,850
<b>I should've accepted that our marriage was over.</b>

654
01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:06,660
<b>I tried so hard to make it work, but it was just an empty shell.</b>

655
01:03:10,130 --> 01:03:11,700
<b>I remember...</b>

656
01:03:11,700 --> 01:03:13,570
<b>proudly telling you that I'm going to protect my family.</b>

657
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:17,870
<b>But look what happened.</b>

658
01:03:19,340 --> 01:03:20,940
<b>I shouldn't have...</b>

659
01:03:24,610 --> 01:03:27,180
<b>gotten the two of you involved between me and Tae Oh.</b>

660
01:03:29,220 --> 01:03:30,620
<b>I feel so sorry.</b>

661
01:03:34,150 --> 01:03:35,960
<b>I don't know what to say.</b>

662
01:03:36,920 --> 01:03:38,460
<b>Now that it's over,</b>

663
01:03:41,700 --> 01:03:42,830
<b>I finally realize...</b>

664
01:03:44,130 --> 01:03:45,870
<b>that I wasn't holding onto our marriage...</b>

665
01:03:48,340 --> 01:03:50,900
<b>out of love. I was just being obstinate.</b>

666
01:03:53,370 --> 01:03:55,440
<b>I learned that it's useless to be obsessed...</b>

667
01:03:56,010 --> 01:03:58,110
<b>and that it only worsens your pain.</b>

<b>Sun Woo.</b>

669
01:04:03,050 --> 01:04:04,280
<b>You should also...</b>

670
01:04:07,450 --> 01:04:08,960
<b>stop thinking about Tae Oh.</b>

671
01:04:10,820 --> 01:04:13,030
<b>Free yourself from him.</b>

672
01:04:14,030 --> 01:04:15,930
<b>Just forget about everything and leave this place.</b>

673
01:04:16,900 --> 01:04:19,470
<b>Who cares if he wants revenge? Just don't interact with him.</b>

674
01:04:20,230 --> 01:04:22,100
<b>But you're still here fighting back.</b>

675
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:24,570
<b>And that just seems like an obsession to me.</b>

676
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:35,780
<b>What's marriage?</b>

677
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:39,020
<b>And what's divorce?</b>

678
01:04:42,590 --> 01:04:45,260
<b>Some people stay married...</b>

679
01:04:46,060 --> 01:04:48,500
<b>even though they know it's an empty shell.</b>

680
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:51,200
<b>On the other hand, I let go.</b>

681
01:04:52,430 --> 01:04:53,830
<b>We're no longer together.</b>

682
01:04:54,770 --> 01:04:56,170
<b>So I don't get...</b>

683
01:04:58,310 --> 01:04:59,740
<b>why we can't be free from each other.</b>

684
01:04:59,740 --> 01:05:01,410
<b>It's not like that with everyone.</b>

685
01:05:02,180 --> 01:05:03,510
<b>That's all on you.</b>

686
01:05:05,580 --> 01:05:08,180
<b>If you keep fighting each other, this will never end.</b>

687
01:05:08,680 --> 01:05:09,820
<b>I personally think...</b>

688
01:05:10,580 --> 01:05:13,350
<b>you're no different from Tae Oh.</b>

689
01:05:29,100 --> 01:05:30,370
<b>Take it.</b>

690
01:05:39,050 --> 01:05:40,180
<b>What's this?</b>

691
01:05:41,010 --> 01:05:44,550
<b>Will it be enough if I give you this much money every month?</b>

692
01:05:46,050 --> 01:05:49,660
<b>You can quit working here whenever you want.</b>

693
01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:53,530
<b>I'm capable of making a living for you.</b>

694
01:05:56,330 --> 01:05:58,200
<b>What do you think? Do you see a future with us now?</b>

695
01:06:01,100 --> 01:06:04,400
<b>Isn't this enough to impress you?</b>

696
01:06:09,710 --> 01:06:12,110
<b>May I ask what kind of a job you got?</b>

697
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:15,080
<b>Why are you asking that?</b>

698
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:16,780
<b>Don't you trust me?</b>

699
01:06:20,650 --> 01:06:22,990
<b>Where are you staying?</b>

700
01:06:38,540 --> 01:06:40,040
<b>(Min Hyun Seo)</b>

<b>In Kyu came to see me.</b>

702
01:06:51,320 --> 01:06:52,490
<b>Are you okay?</b>

703
01:06:54,390 --> 01:06:56,290
<b>He has a lot of money.</b>

704
01:06:57,020 --> 01:07:00,790
<b>I think your suspicions were right.</b>

705
01:07:04,060 --> 01:07:05,800
<b>Do you know where he is right now?</b>

706
01:07:29,890 --> 01:07:31,190
<b>Can we talk?</b>

707
01:07:38,390 --> 01:07:39,790
<b>That's quite the scar.</b>

708
01:07:42,290 --> 01:07:44,060
<b>It wouldn't have scarred...</b>

709

710

<b>Did you see a doctor?</b>

711
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:54,200
<b>Say what you came to say.</b>

712

<b>I don't feel like talking to you.</b>

<b>How much did Tae Oh order you to do?</b>

<b>Did he say to threaten me until I leave this town?</b>

721
01:08:31,910 --> 01:08:32,980
<b>Or did he say...</b>

722
01:08:37,280 --> 01:08:38,380
<b>to kill me?</b>

723

<b>Have you no fear?</b>

01:08:50,730 --> 01:08:51,900
<b>Should I...</b>

<b>- finish what I couldn't do before? - How much did he promise you?</b>

<b>- Was it worth your future? - What gibberish.</b>

<b>I'm asking if it was worth your future.</b>

<b>Who are you to talk about my future?</b>

<b>You're the reason I went to jail!</b>

<b>for the things that you do.</b>

<b>Didn't you learn from experience?</b>

<b>Do you think Tae Oh will take care of you for life?</b>

<b>We're stunned too.</b>

<b>I don't know.</b>

<b>I think she was moving to another city.</b>
