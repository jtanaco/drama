<b>Heaven and earth will pass away,

2
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:19,243
<b>No one knows about that day or hour,</b>

3
00:00:19,898 --> 00:00:22,279
<b>not even the Son, but only...</b>

4
00:00:22,627 --> 00:00:26,016
<b>(Episode 15)</b>

5
00:00:26,097 --> 00:00:27,097
<b>That book.</b>

6
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:30,654
<b>That book is wrong.</b>

7
00:00:30,821 --> 00:00:32,289
<b>Bring me my book.</b>

8
00:00:32,718 --> 00:00:35,836
<b>Not that crappy copy,
bring my real book.</b>

9
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:36,971
<b>The contents are the same.</b>

10
00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:38,896
<b>No, then this wouldn't have
happened!</b>

11
00:00:38,962 --> 00:00:40,230
<b>Bring me my book now.</b>

12
00:00:40,601 --> 00:00:43,066
<b>If you're not deceiving me...</b>

13
00:00:44,109 --> 00:00:46,619
<b>Then what?</b>

14
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:48,687
<b>Are you saying...</b>

15
00:00:48,972 --> 00:00:51,241
<b>I was the fool?</b>

16
00:00:51,408 --> 00:00:53,443
<b>It has to be either you or me.</b>

17
00:00:53,953 --> 00:00:55,288
<b>You know where it is, and...</b>

18
00:00:55,313 --> 00:00:57,313
<b>I would never deceive you!</b>

19
00:00:57,781 --> 00:00:59,550
<b>I deceive no one!</b>

20
00:01:01,531 --> 00:01:03,053
<b>My father also...</b>

21
00:01:03,632 --> 00:01:05,109
<b>didn't lie to me.</b>

22
00:01:05,522 --> 00:01:06,485
<b>So...</b>

23
00:01:06,509 --> 00:01:10,227
<b>bring me the real book from Sang Ho.</b>

24
00:01:11,281 --> 00:01:13,664
<b>Were you memorizing the same things
with Hee Jung?</b>

25
00:01:15,303 --> 00:01:17,041
<b>Have you ever checked with her?</b>

26
00:01:23,203 --> 00:01:25,275
<b>My father did not lie to me.</b>

27
00:01:28,203 --> 00:01:29,980
<b>He would never...</b>

28
00:01:42,766 --> 00:01:44,995
<b>Not even the Son, but only...</b>

29
00:01:45,601 --> 00:01:47,631
<b>the Father knows.</b>

30
00:01:47,863 --> 00:01:51,805
<b>Holy wound and blessed pain.</b>

31
00:01:55,109 --> 00:01:58,408
<b>Please allow me to give
my testimony at tomorrow's service.</b>

32
00:01:58,542 --> 00:01:59,820
<b>Did you...</b>

33
00:01:59,844 --> 00:02:02,664
<b>experience something
in the meantime?</b>

34
00:02:02,688 --> 00:02:04,078
<b>Seven times...</b>

35
00:02:04,581 --> 00:02:05,983
<b>for the last two years.</b>

36
00:02:06,917 --> 00:02:10,265
<b>Pastor Seo's deep faith in
the miracle of resurrection was...</b>

37
00:02:10,836 --> 00:02:12,556
<b>indeed a special experience.</b>

38
00:02:12,756 --> 00:02:15,281
<b>So special that I want to share with
the believers of New Life Church...</b>

39
00:02:15,305 --> 00:02:17,561
<b>No, with everyone in this world.</b>

40
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:20,156
<b>Stop beating around the bush,
and say it clearly.</b>

41
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:21,992
<b>The stigmata serial murder.</b>

42
00:02:22,399 --> 00:02:24,768
<b>Holy wound and blessed pain.</b>

43
00:02:24,883 --> 00:02:26,306
<b>It's what Pastor Seo said
every time...</b>

44
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:28,135
<b>he pierced
through the hands of the victims.</b>

45
00:02:28,238 --> 00:02:31,673
<b>It's also what I always heard
after I got the cane in the past.</b>

46
00:02:34,678 --> 00:02:37,481
<b>I will stop your son.</b>

47
00:02:37,748 --> 00:02:38,815
<b>Instead,</b>

48
00:02:39,149 --> 00:02:41,985
<b>the present you were planning
to give to your daughter,</b>

49
00:02:42,621 --> 00:02:44,697
<b>- give it to me.
- No way.</b>

50
00:02:44,721 --> 00:02:47,401
<b>Do you mean the land
for the house of prayer to be built?</b>

51
00:02:47,425 --> 00:02:49,593
<b>We should at least
give and take that much...</b>

52
00:02:51,336 --> 00:02:53,336
<b>to establish trust between us.</b>

53
00:02:59,484 --> 00:03:02,105
<b>It's not enough.</b>

54
00:03:02,246 --> 00:03:04,741
<b>You should risk your life...</b>

55
00:03:05,133 --> 00:03:07,844
<b>for me to trust you. Am I wrong?</b>

56
00:03:11,081 --> 00:03:12,282
<b>I'm doing it tomorrow.</b>

57
00:03:15,141 --> 00:03:18,255
<b>I'll take care of it.
Stop worrying and just wait.</b>

58
00:03:33,117 --> 00:03:35,238
<b>I'll give you the land
as we promised.</b>

59
00:03:35,648 --> 00:03:38,542
<b>You should hold on to it well
until I get it back.</b>

60
00:03:40,281 --> 00:03:43,480
<b>No one knows about that day or hour,</b>

61
00:03:43,847 --> 00:03:47,195
<b>not even the angels in heaven,
nor the Son...</b>

62
00:03:47,219 --> 00:03:48,452
<b>But only...</b>

63
00:03:49,469 --> 00:03:51,098
<b>the Father knows.</b>

64
00:03:51,122 --> 00:03:52,589
<b>Don't you worry.</b>

65
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:56,804
<b>From now on, we're
in a symbiotic relationship.</b>

66
00:03:56,828 --> 00:04:00,530
<b>I'm going to hide it in the way...</b>

67
00:04:01,098 --> 00:04:03,300
<b>that only I can find it.</b>

68
00:04:07,687 --> 00:04:11,007
<b>Sang Ho had two private meetings
with Pastor Kwon.</b>

69
00:04:11,541 --> 00:04:13,644
<b>And after that,</b>

70
00:04:14,678 --> 00:04:16,655
<b>the land where we planned
to build the house of prayer...</b>

71
00:04:16,679 --> 00:04:18,415
<b>went to Sang Ho.</b>

72
00:04:19,312 --> 00:04:22,119
<b>It was a land with a great view
of the ocean.</b>

73
00:04:23,211 --> 00:04:25,211
<b>Hee Jung loved it.</b>

74
00:04:28,025 --> 00:04:29,392
<b>Drink this.</b>

75
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:40,414
<b>Pastor Kwon must have had a weakness
seized upon Sang Ho.</b>

76
00:04:40,438 --> 00:04:41,448
<b>For instance,</b>

77
00:04:41,472 --> 00:04:43,921
<b>one of his children was
a serial killer...</b>

78
00:04:43,945 --> 00:04:46,094
<b>that made a huge stir.</b>

79
00:04:46,343 --> 00:04:49,757
<b>Sang Ho must have gotten the land
for keeping it a secret.</b>

80
00:04:49,781 --> 00:04:50,947
<b>I didn't know.</b>

81
00:04:51,048 --> 00:04:52,849
<b>I didn't know about their deal
at the time.</b>

82
00:04:53,116 --> 00:04:55,351
<b>This is what the pastor told me.</b>

83
00:04:55,477 --> 00:04:57,120
<b>That he and Sang Ho are...</b>

84
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,320
<b>in a symbiotic relationship.</b>

85
00:04:59,601 --> 00:05:01,191
<b>He also said in that deal...</b>

86
00:05:01,525 --> 00:05:03,927
<b>that he'll hide it
where only he knows.</b>

87
00:05:04,394 --> 00:05:07,330
<b>Then he made that special gospel.</b>

88
00:05:07,698 --> 00:05:09,843
<b>He said that that book is...</b>

89
00:05:09,867 --> 00:05:13,180
<b>a map to reveal Sang Ho's sins.</b>

90
00:05:13,204 --> 00:05:15,906
<b>Do you know when the private
meetings were at least roughly?</b>

91
00:05:16,106 --> 00:05:17,274
<b>Roughly?</b>

92
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:21,570
<b>On July 11th, 2000.</b>

93
00:05:22,112 --> 00:05:24,112
<b>The second one was on August 2nd.</b>

94
00:05:27,551 --> 00:05:28,685
<b>(7th murder, July 9th, 2000)</b>

95
00:05:31,354 --> 00:05:33,023
<b>(8th murder, August 1st, 2000)</b>

96
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,404
<b>What happened
to Sang Won after that?</b>

97
00:05:37,428 --> 00:05:40,764
<b>Pastor Kwon had a small building
he was planning to give me.</b>

98
00:05:41,734 --> 00:05:44,067
<b>He suddenly gave it to Hee Jung,</b>

99
00:05:45,135 --> 00:05:48,572
<b>and let Sang Won live
on the top floor.</b>

100
00:05:48,939 --> 00:05:51,359
<b>- For 20 years?
- Yes.</b>

101
00:05:51,383 --> 00:05:52,810
<b>So he was imprisoned.</b>

102
00:05:52,835 --> 00:05:55,002
<b>And you and Hee Jung were
monitoring him.</b>

103
00:05:55,452 --> 00:05:56,646
<b>Am I correct?</b>

104
00:05:57,939 --> 00:05:59,749
<b>We should go now.</b>

105
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,268
<b>Do you trust me?</b>

106
00:06:18,668 --> 00:06:20,770
<b>I can still reach out for someone
I don't trust.</b>

107
00:06:36,871 --> 00:06:38,866
<b>Hee Jung must have threatened
Sang Ho...</b>

108
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:41,057
<b>that she'll find the book
and reveal his sins.</b>

109
00:06:44,203 --> 00:06:45,203
<b>Here.</b>

110
00:06:45,228 --> 00:06:46,930
<b>Let's talk while drinking tea.</b>

111
00:06:47,726 --> 00:06:48,808
<b>Sure.</b>

112
00:06:50,393 --> 00:06:51,619
<b>Look at that.</b>

113
00:06:51,643 --> 00:06:54,504
<b>He was so healthy
like he was going to live forever.</b>

114
00:06:55,272 --> 00:06:57,184
<b>Why don't you two...</b>

115
00:06:57,208 --> 00:07:00,563
<b>get your hearts checked
for any problems.</b>

116
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:01,811
<b>Thanks.</b>

117
00:07:01,841 --> 00:07:03,669
<b>I'll have it tested as you said.</b>

118
00:07:03,693 --> 00:07:06,149
<b>- Good.
- Sang Ho.</b>

119
00:07:07,023 --> 00:07:09,000
<b>We should finish our deal now.</b>

120
00:07:09,024 --> 00:07:09,663
<b>"We"?</b>

121
00:07:09,687 --> 00:07:11,875
<b>The evidence of your sins
that you promised to give back...</b>

122
00:07:11,899 --> 00:07:13,899
<b>when the statute of limitations
expired.</b>

123
00:07:14,605 --> 00:07:18,071
<b>Sadly, Sang Won's sins disappeared.</b>

124
00:07:18,095 --> 00:07:20,430
<b>But your sins gained immortality.</b>

125
00:07:22,566 --> 00:07:24,711
<b>Are you saying you'll pay me?</b>

126
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:28,315
<b>Instead, I should get my hotel back
which was supposed to be mine.</b>

127
00:07:28,339 --> 00:07:30,437
<b>I'll only take the market price
for the land.</b>

128
00:07:30,461 --> 00:07:32,553
<b>No, I want the interest too.</b>

129
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:35,867
<b>You still have One Life Foundation
when you lose the hotel.</b>

130
00:07:37,848 --> 00:07:40,727
<b>Deacon Jang, you don't know...</b>

131
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:42,963
<b>where my sins are, right?</b>

132
00:07:42,987 --> 00:07:44,831
<b>I also know about the map that...</b>

133
00:07:44,855 --> 00:07:46,556
<b>Deacon Jang!</b>

134
00:07:48,039 --> 00:07:50,860
<b>You should see
how Sang Won is doing.</b>

135
00:07:51,161 --> 00:07:52,863
<b>Right. I forgot.</b>

136
00:08:04,774 --> 00:08:06,469
<b>She asked for the hotel?</b>

137
00:08:06,676 --> 00:08:07,878
<b>That's huge.</b>

138
00:08:08,126 --> 00:08:11,086
<b>What would Sang Ho have thought
when he was blackmailed?</b>

139
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:13,650
<b>Wasn't Sang Won the one
who killed Hee Jung?</b>

140
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:14,994
<b>Right.</b>

141
00:08:15,018 --> 00:08:16,898
<b>She was murdered brutally...</b>

142
00:08:16,922 --> 00:08:19,222
<b>by the serial killer
who stayed in hiding for 20 years.</b>

143
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:21,591
<b>Then I got involved.</b>

144
00:08:21,825 --> 00:08:24,238
<b>Because of Sang Won,
Hee Jung's death was...</b>

145
00:08:24,262 --> 00:08:25,862
<b>considered another stigmata murder.</b>

146
00:08:26,296 --> 00:08:28,656
<b>All the other possibilities were
ruled out in the beginning.</b>

147
00:08:32,695 --> 00:08:35,672
<b>There are a lot of blind spots
in that area.</b>

148
00:08:35,855 --> 00:08:38,375
<b>Yes, if someone decided to,</b>

149
00:08:39,328 --> 00:08:41,328
<b>one could come and go
without being seen.</b>

150
00:08:42,499 --> 00:08:43,953
<b>Jang Ki Ho.</b>

151
00:08:43,977 --> 00:08:46,516
<b>If I knew you'd be trouble,</b>

152
00:08:50,086 --> 00:08:52,989
<b>should I have kept Hee Jung alive?</b>

153
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:58,772
<b>I was waiting for death
without a name...</b>

154
00:08:58,796 --> 00:09:00,597
<b>in that locked room.</b>

155
00:09:01,022 --> 00:09:02,648
<b>You came in like an angel,</b>

156
00:09:02,672 --> 00:09:05,268
<b>saved my life,
and granted me your name.</b>

157
00:09:05,735 --> 00:09:08,438
<b>You have always been the owner
of my soul since then.</b>

158
00:09:09,031 --> 00:09:10,340
<b>But then,</b>

159
00:09:10,427 --> 00:09:13,623
<b>I let the seeds of distrust
of you and let them...</b>

160
00:09:13,648 --> 00:09:15,345
<b>encroach on my soul.</b>

161
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:19,554
<b>My pupil who used to be loyal.</b>

162
00:09:19,578 --> 00:09:23,336
<b>- Father.
- My won who used to be faithful.</b>

163
00:09:24,344 --> 00:09:26,589
<b>I want to rip out my heart...</b>

164
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:29,659
<b>and go back.</b>

165
00:09:30,359 --> 00:09:33,863
<b>What do you want me to do?</b>

166
00:09:35,335 --> 00:09:37,624
<b>Punish corrupted Hee Jung...</b>

167
00:09:37,648 --> 00:09:39,648
<b>for suppressing
the grace of salvation.</b>

168
00:09:39,744 --> 00:09:40,845
<b>And...</b>

169
00:09:42,038 --> 00:09:43,884
<b>complete the number eight
of salvation...</b>

170
00:09:43,908 --> 00:09:46,309
<b>to show the whole world
the miracle of resurrection.</b>

171
00:09:47,899 --> 00:09:50,493
<b>I cannot complete the miracle...</b>

172
00:09:51,195 --> 00:09:53,249
<b>with the death
of corrupted Hee Jung.</b>

173
00:09:53,431 --> 00:09:55,967
<b>Then Father,</b>

174
00:09:56,119 --> 00:09:58,154
<b>let me punish her...</b>

175
00:09:58,325 --> 00:10:00,325
<b>to make up for your humiliation.</b>

176
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:02,859
<b>I give you permission.</b>

177
00:10:21,695 --> 00:10:23,346
<b>Pastor Seo.</b>

178
00:10:23,913 --> 00:10:25,913
<b>You should open the windows
for some fresh air.</b>

179
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,556
<b>But he was pierced
for our transgressions,</b>

180
00:10:35,365 --> 00:10:40,029
<b>he was crushed for our iniquities.</b>

181
00:10:42,194 --> 00:10:47,470
<b>The punishment that brought us
peace was upon him.</b>

182
00:10:47,871 --> 00:10:55,278
<b>The punishment that brought us
peace was upon him.</b>

183
00:11:00,617 --> 00:11:05,755
<b>And with his stripes, we are healed.</b>

184
00:11:21,304 --> 00:11:24,517
<b>You've always looked at me like that
since we first met.</b>

185
00:11:24,808 --> 00:11:28,021
<b>So even if you haven't
threatened me,</b>

186
00:11:28,045 --> 00:11:29,045
<b>yes.</b>

187
00:11:30,133 --> 00:11:32,348
<b>You would end up like this
by me someday.</b>

188
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:34,428
<b>The way you look at me is...</b>

189
00:11:34,452 --> 00:11:36,779
<b>very similar to that of the one
who abandoned me.</b>

190
00:11:37,454 --> 00:11:40,202
<b>Don't get me wrong. I'm just talking
about the way you look at me.</b>

191
00:11:40,226 --> 00:11:43,259
<b>My mom was quite a beauty
unlike you.</b>

192
00:11:44,294 --> 00:11:45,628
<b>You know, I take a lot after her.</b>

193
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:57,440
<b>You're dying like the women
who were killed by Father.</b>

194
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:00,353
<b>One of them lost her life
in less than half an hour.</b>

195
00:12:00,377 --> 00:12:02,378
<b>He stabbed too deep.</b>

196
00:12:02,812 --> 00:12:04,981
<b>But it'll take a while for you...</b>

197
00:12:06,608 --> 00:12:08,428
<b>because I didn't want to end it
too soon.</b>

198
00:12:08,452 --> 00:12:09,485
<b>How do you like it?</b>

199
00:12:10,976 --> 00:12:15,063
<b>The map that has the location
where my secret has been hidden.</b>

200
00:12:15,469 --> 00:12:17,060
<b>Ki Ho went to find it, right?</b>

201
00:12:18,406 --> 00:12:19,596
<b>It's time to open your mouth.</b>

202
00:12:22,109 --> 00:12:24,234
<b>Oh, right.</b>

203
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:26,970
<b>There's no use of screaming.</b>

204
00:12:27,437 --> 00:12:28,437
<b>You know that, right?</b>

205
00:12:34,008 --> 00:12:35,111
<b>Where is it?</b>

206
00:12:35,426 --> 00:12:36,946
<b>If I die,</b>

207
00:12:38,406 --> 00:12:40,890
<b>it'll be revealed
to the whole world.</b>

208
00:12:42,539 --> 00:12:45,031
<b>You said the same thing
when you started threatening me.</b>

209
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:46,390
<b>But you know what?</b>

210
00:12:47,655 --> 00:12:49,726
<b>Father told me everything.</b>

211
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:53,273
<b>Kwon Jae Chun, the old geezer,
never trusted you guys...</b>

212
00:12:53,297 --> 00:12:55,365
<b>and didn't show it to you at all.</b>

213
00:12:55,665 --> 00:12:58,768
<b>He said none of you guys know
where it is.</b>

214
00:13:03,476 --> 00:13:04,641
<b>Ki Ho,</b>

215
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:07,510
<b>no.</b>

216
00:13:08,178 --> 00:13:10,480
<b>My faithful brother must have...</b>

217
00:13:11,055 --> 00:13:15,251
<b>laid his hands upon the map by now.</b>

218
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:18,755
<b>What do you think will happen
if I die?</b>

219
00:13:20,182 --> 00:13:23,259
<b>The world will know about your sins.</b>

220
00:13:24,124 --> 00:13:29,732
<b>Then, you'll be put behind bars
for good.</b>

221
00:13:29,899 --> 00:13:34,604
<b>Just like little Sang Ho...</b>

222
00:13:35,641 --> 00:13:39,275
<b>who couldn't get outside on his own.</b>

223
00:13:41,633 --> 00:13:42,845
<b>What?</b>

224
00:13:53,765 --> 00:13:56,125
<b>So that means...</b>

225
00:13:56,559 --> 00:13:59,062
<b>you're not the only one
who can read the map.</b>

226
00:14:33,078 --> 00:14:34,608
<b>What are you thinking?</b>

227
00:14:34,632 --> 00:14:37,700
<b>Kwon Jae Chun's
dead son and daughter.</b>

228
00:14:37,867 --> 00:14:42,696
<b>And his only alive son, Ki Ho.</b>

229
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,974
<b>He might show up...</b>

230
00:14:45,174 --> 00:14:47,587
<b>because he might've learned
that I have the book.</b>

231
00:14:47,611 --> 00:14:49,612
<b>When will you think about us?</b>

232
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:56,235
<b>I won't. You're already mine.</b>

233
00:15:04,929 --> 00:15:07,764
<b>As long as you trust me
and remain unwavering,</b>

234
00:15:08,255 --> 00:15:09,835
<b>we're safe.</b>

235
00:15:09,859 --> 00:15:12,535
<b>How can we trust you
when you're so swayed?</b>

236
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:18,336
<b>Time is running out.</b>

237
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:20,443
<b>And now that I'm a grown-up,</b>

238
00:15:22,345 --> 00:15:23,980
<b>I can take care of it by myself.</b>

239
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:25,680
<b>Did you look into it?</b>

240
00:15:25,704 --> 00:15:27,280
<b>Until two years ago,
the Suncheon branch...</b>

241
00:15:27,304 --> 00:15:29,304
<b>of New Life Church had been located
at the site.</b>

242
00:15:29,452 --> 00:15:32,288
<b>They disbanded the branch
when they sold the land.</b>

243
00:15:32,455 --> 00:15:35,702
<b>Can you check if Pastor Kwon went
there before it was torn down?</b>

244
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:37,360
<b>- Sure.
- Thanks.</b>

245
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,594
<b>Young Jin.</b>

246
00:15:39,742 --> 00:15:41,281
<b>- Yes?
- You know...</b>

247
00:15:41,305 --> 00:15:44,177
<b>we fumble around most of the time
until we solve cases.</b>

248
00:15:44,201 --> 00:15:46,936
<b>- What is it you want to say?
- This is just what we do.</b>

249
00:15:47,937 --> 00:15:50,072
<b>- Just work.
- You're right.</b>

250
00:15:51,297 --> 00:15:54,010
<b>It's just work. It clears my head.</b>

251
00:15:55,656 --> 00:15:56,867
<b>Thank you.</b>

252
00:16:06,499 --> 00:16:08,191
<b>Can I hit the road now?</b>

253
00:16:09,889 --> 00:16:11,360
<b>Where are we headed for?</b>

254
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:16,199
<b>I'll get off the wrong track now,</b>

255
00:16:18,201 --> 00:16:20,002
<b>and start working properly
back there.</b>

256
00:16:33,049 --> 00:16:35,117
<b>- Anything weird?
- Yes.</b>

257
00:16:35,184 --> 00:16:38,454
<b>We found a clear footprint
above the buried body.</b>

258
00:16:38,505 --> 00:16:40,733
<b>It's the product of a premium
hand-made brand with only one store.</b>

259
00:16:40,757 --> 00:16:42,184
<b>The size is 270 mm.</b>

260
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:44,137
<b>- Get the customer list.
- Okay.</b>

261
00:16:44,161 --> 00:16:46,043
<b>So it's not the same as the one
we found in the container.</b>

262
00:16:46,067 --> 00:16:48,231
<b>- No.
- It's suspicious.</b>

263
00:16:49,141 --> 00:16:50,720
<b>It's fishy.</b>

264
00:16:54,626 --> 00:16:57,306
<b>- I'll make a call. Excuse me.
- Sure.</b>

265
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:01,611
<b>- Yes, Ms. Cha.
- How is everything there?</b>

266
00:17:01,778 --> 00:17:03,663
<b>Nothing special. Did you find it?</b>

267
00:17:03,687 --> 00:17:05,281
<b>No. I'll explain when I get there.</b>

268
00:17:06,289 --> 00:17:07,550
<b>What about Eun Ho?</b>

269
00:17:07,671 --> 00:17:10,068
<b>He's walking pretty well
holding onto the wall.</b>

270
00:17:10,092 --> 00:17:11,597
<b>I want to talk to her.</b>

271
00:17:11,621 --> 00:17:12,989
<b>He wants to talk to you.</b>

272
00:17:14,656 --> 00:17:16,669
<b>- Are you all right?
- Yes.</b>

273
00:17:16,693 --> 00:17:18,138
<b>You sound tired.</b>

274
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:20,306
<b>Of course.
I stayed up all night long.</b>

275
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:22,175
<b>But you're driving now.</b>

276
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:24,544
<b>- Get some rest first.
- I can deal with it.</b>

277
00:17:24,568 --> 00:17:26,079
<b>Is that guy with you?</b>

278
00:17:26,103 --> 00:17:28,838
<b>You don't need to worry.
Go back and continue working.</b>

279
00:17:30,008 --> 00:17:31,951
<b>- Is it Eun Ho?
- Yes.</b>

280
00:17:31,975 --> 00:17:34,510
<b>I've wanted to know
what kind of person you are.</b>

281
00:17:38,881 --> 00:17:42,118
<b>I found it in Eun Ho's ward.
It was attached under the bed.</b>

282
00:17:44,653 --> 00:17:46,589
<b>I feel uncomfortable.</b>

283
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:50,860
<b>Eun Ho and I have been friends
for seven years.</b>

284
00:17:51,006 --> 00:17:54,597
<b>You're 20 years older than him.
Do you think that's right?</b>

285
00:17:54,747 --> 00:17:56,532
<b>To be frank,</b>

286
00:17:56,732 --> 00:17:59,178
<b>you only keep in touch with him
to feel superior to me.</b>

287
00:17:59,202 --> 00:18:01,383
<b>I'm a good adult.
What kind of mother is that?</b>

288
00:18:01,407 --> 00:18:02,948
<b>Don't you say that to yourself?</b>

289
00:18:02,972 --> 00:18:04,617
<b>Am I wrong? Why?</b>

290
00:18:04,641 --> 00:18:06,375
<b>Why do you think...</b>

291
00:18:07,151 --> 00:18:07,987
<b>Stop.</b>

292
00:18:08,011 --> 00:18:10,413
<b>Let go of me.</b>

293
00:18:11,683 --> 00:18:13,182
<b>I was very curious...</b>

294
00:18:13,282 --> 00:18:16,218
<b>about what you said to Eun Ho's mom
outside the ward...</b>

295
00:18:16,519 --> 00:18:18,521
<b>because her attitude changed
totally afterward.</b>

296
00:18:18,788 --> 00:18:21,234
<b>You can say
whatever you want to me...</b>

297
00:18:21,258 --> 00:18:23,259
<b>because you're no one to me.</b>

298
00:18:23,659 --> 00:18:26,362
<b>But watch your mouth
in front of your son.</b>

299
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:28,598
<b>You're his mother.</b>

300
00:18:29,131 --> 00:18:31,667
<b>No matter how kind and friendly
someone is,</b>

301
00:18:31,834 --> 00:18:33,703
<b>that person can never replace you.</b>

302
00:18:35,178 --> 00:18:37,016
<b>That's what parents are
to their kids.</b>

303
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,822
<b>But Eun Ho had his mom
by his side.</b>

304
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:43,805
<b>How could you take care of him
for seven years?</b>

305
00:18:43,829 --> 00:18:45,481
<b>You just heard it.</b>

306
00:18:46,088 --> 00:18:48,918
<b>Eun Ho and I are friends.</b>

307
00:18:50,234 --> 00:18:53,864
<b>He talked to me and worried about me
first.</b>

308
00:18:54,207 --> 00:18:56,124
<b>I just did
what I was supposed to do,</b>

309
00:18:58,367 --> 00:19:00,329
<b>but he called me a hero.</b>

310
00:19:00,663 --> 00:19:03,238
<b>I was lonely,
but I was fine with it.</b>

311
00:19:03,799 --> 00:19:05,559
<b>But I realized this
after Eun Ho got injured.</b>

312
00:19:07,162 --> 00:19:08,804
<b>That I haven't been lonely.</b>

313
00:19:17,543 --> 00:19:20,182
<b>Eun Ho, can you come here
by yourself?</b>

314
00:19:20,354 --> 00:19:21,751
<b>I'll try.</b>

315
00:19:32,114 --> 00:19:34,430
<b>- It's tough, isn't it?
- A little.</b>

316
00:19:34,864 --> 00:19:36,976
<b>Still, I'm happy.
I wish I could run.</b>

317
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,235
<b>We should play soccer
after you recover.</b>

318
00:19:39,835 --> 00:19:42,505
<b>What about Felony Crime Section One
versus Class 2-2?</b>

319
00:19:42,578 --> 00:19:44,540
<b>- Sounds good.
- Before that,</b>

320
00:19:45,171 --> 00:19:46,942
<b>let's eat breakfast first.
I'm hungry.</b>

321

<b>What are you doing here?
Didn't you go to school?</b>

322
00:19:53,954 --> 00:19:55,084
<b>It's Saturday.</b>

323
00:19:55,718 --> 00:19:58,297
<b>- Right. Did you have breakfast?
- No.</b>

324

<b>Tell me whatever you want.
It's on me today.</b>

325
00:20:00,508 --> 00:20:05,015
<b>I met Eun Ho's mother on our way,
and she gave us this gimbap.</b>

326
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:06,039
<b>What about her?</b>

327
00:20:06,362 --> 00:20:07,714
<b>She said she'd have
some hangover soup.</b>

328
00:20:07,738 --> 00:20:10,176
<b>- Is your mom a good cook?
- No.</b>

329
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,077
<b>That was flat.</b>

330
00:20:11,101 --> 00:20:12,378
<b>Eun Ho is good at cooking.</b>

331
00:20:12,402 --> 00:20:14,847
<b>Because my mom is too busy to cook.</b>

332
00:20:14,871 --> 00:20:15,982
<b>I have to do it.</b>

333
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:18,518
<b>Let's have a pork belly party
at the rooftop of my house later.</b>

334

<b>The room isn't spacious,

<b>Are you in?</b>

336
00:20:22,331 --> 00:20:24,624
<b>- What about you, Min Sung?
- I will if I can.</b>

337
00:20:24,648 --> 00:20:27,583
<b>If I can make it,
I'll bring beef or lobster.</b>

338
00:20:29,819 --> 00:20:31,899
<b>You're annoying, but I hope
you can make it for sure.</b>

339

<b>- Let's eat and go back to work.
- Okay.</b>

340
00:20:37,994 --> 00:20:39,172
<b>Do you work on weekends too?</b>

341
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:42,942
<b>We work 24 hours

<b>Isn't it cool?</b>

343
00:20:45,058 --> 00:20:46,312

344
00:20:48,843 --> 00:20:49,874

<b>We have to go back to the office.
All right, let's eat.</b>

<b>I've chosen to be on the side

<b>Will you also have a chance

<b>Eun Ho, make sure you wake up.</b>

358

<b>- Yes.

- Thank you for your hard work.</b>

<b>Don't mention it. It's our duty.</b>

<b>You're the one

<b>It felt like

<b>But now I'm excited
before opening it.</b>

375
00:22:33,824 --> 00:22:35,644
<b>I wonder who's here...</b>

376
00:22:35,978 --> 00:22:37,618
<b>and what they will
talk about with Eun Ho.</b>

00:28:19,923 --> 00:28:23,525
<b>I would've saved him
even if I'd known he was a bad man.</b>

460
00:28:33,427 --> 00:28:35,237
<b>I got the list of buyers.</b>

461
00:28:35,562 --> 00:28:37,237
<b>I sorted them out
in alphabetical order.</b>

462
00:28:40,999 --> 00:28:42,044
<b>Wait.</b>

463
00:28:42,156 --> 00:28:43,606
<b>- There we go.
- Is it Oh Doo Seok?</b>

464
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:46,058
<b>Yes. "Oh Doo Seok, 270."</b>

465
00:28:46,082 --> 00:28:48,894
<b>The sole of his shoe is the same
as the mark found at the site.</b>

466
00:28:48,918 --> 00:28:50,696
<b>It's strange
how things are going so smoothly.</b>

467
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:53,422
<b>He isn't an amateur,
so why did he leave a trace?</b>

468
00:28:55,006 --> 00:28:56,388
<b>- Welcome.
- We're back.</b>

469
00:28:56,412 --> 00:28:57,559
<b>We're back.</b>

470
00:28:58,861 --> 00:29:00,963
<b>- Aren't you going to report?
- You found it.</b>

471
00:29:03,591 --> 00:29:05,418
<b>We found the man
who snatched Eun Ho's backpack.</b>

472
00:29:05,442 --> 00:29:07,947
<b>I'm guessing it's a familiar name
this time again.</b>

473
00:29:07,971 --> 00:29:10,082
<b>It's Baek Sang Ho's secretary,
Oh Doo Seok.</b>

474
00:29:10,106 --> 00:29:11,707
<b>We got his name too.</b>

475
00:29:22,834 --> 00:29:24,273
<b>- Yes.
- The footprint and the snatcher...</b>

476
00:29:24,297 --> 00:29:25,878
<b>both indicate Oh Doo Seok.</b>

477
00:29:26,285 --> 00:29:30,192
<b>- What about our colleagues?
- They're waiting for your order.</b>

478
00:29:33,095 --> 00:29:34,640
<b>(Cha Young Jin)</b>

479
00:29:34,664 --> 00:29:37,276
<b>Team One, protect Ki Ho
and reinforce the investigation.</b>

480
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:39,211
<b>Team Two, you're going
to the hotel with me.</b>

481
00:29:39,235 --> 00:29:40,435
<b>- All right, move.
- Okay.</b>

482
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:46,174
<b>(Oh Doo Seok)</b>

483
00:29:47,209 --> 00:29:48,510
<b>Follow me.</b>

484
00:30:03,427 --> 00:30:05,360
<b>This place has high security.</b>

485
00:30:05,703 --> 00:30:08,163
<b>The police will come at night.</b>

486
00:30:08,762 --> 00:30:10,432
<b>- I see.
- Put this on.</b>

487
00:30:10,468 --> 00:30:12,772
<b>In case of emergency,
press this button...</b>

488
00:30:12,796 --> 00:30:15,631
<b>to let us know where you are
and come for you.</b>

489
00:30:21,156 --> 00:30:22,838
<b>Here. Open your mouth.</b>

490
00:30:28,265 --> 00:30:29,378
<b>Good.</b>

491
00:30:33,757 --> 00:30:36,686
<b>It's more accurate
when it's dried properly.</b>

492
00:30:37,475 --> 00:30:39,021
<b>I have a question.</b>

493
00:30:39,255 --> 00:30:42,168
<b>What happens if you can't tell
whose DNA it is?</b>

494
00:30:42,192 --> 00:30:43,759
<b>Simply put,</b>

495
00:30:44,193 --> 00:30:45,461
<b>we've been given false hope.</b>

496
00:31:23,925 --> 00:31:26,045
<b>- Hello.
- You remember me, right?</b>

497
00:31:26,069 --> 00:31:27,403
<b>Of course.</b>

498
00:31:27,945 --> 00:31:30,324
<b>We're getting this place
completely remodeled.</b>

499
00:31:30,348 --> 00:31:31,607
<b>It's a bit messy.</b>

500
00:31:31,774 --> 00:31:33,542
<b>You started the construction
quite urgently.</b>

501
00:31:33,876 --> 00:31:35,455
<b>It was planned a long time ago.</b>

502
00:31:35,479 --> 00:31:37,346
<b>I saw a picture of your friend...</b>

503
00:31:37,622 --> 00:31:39,190
<b>and a red phone.</b>

504
00:31:40,683 --> 00:31:43,219
<b>I saw them in the study
on the tenth floor of the hotel.</b>

505
00:31:43,352 --> 00:31:45,698
<b>- Is the tenth floor part of it?
- Of course.</b>

506
00:31:45,722 --> 00:31:47,476
<b>We're changing everything...</b>

507
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:50,336
<b>so that we won't even remember
the traces of the past.</b>

508
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,727
<b>It'll be all new.</b>

509
00:31:52,161 --> 00:31:54,497
<b>By the way, what brings you here?</b>

510
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:56,909
<b>I'm here to see Mr. Oh Doo Seok.</b>

511
00:31:56,933 --> 00:31:58,234
<b>But his phone is off.</b>

512
00:31:58,301 --> 00:32:01,147
<b>Is he in the hotel,
or is he with Chairman Baek?</b>

513
00:32:01,171 --> 00:32:02,796
<b>Is this because of Ko Eun Ho's fall?</b>

514
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:04,884
<b>Will your answer change
according to my reason?</b>

515
00:32:04,908 --> 00:32:06,108
<b>No.</b>

516
00:32:06,748 --> 00:32:10,446
<b>Actually, I'm pretty anxious
about Manager Oh.</b>

517
00:32:10,724 --> 00:32:13,669
<b>He disappeared two days ago.
And before that,</b>

518
00:32:13,693 --> 00:32:16,536
<b>he asked me to get him
a huge amount of money.</b>

519
00:32:16,966 --> 00:32:19,342
<b>- So did you give him the money?
- No, not yet.</b>

520
00:32:19,427 --> 00:32:22,426
<b>He's probably waiting for my call.
He told me his new number...</b>

521
00:32:22,685 --> 00:32:24,685
<b>and asked me to give him a call.</b>

522
00:32:24,904 --> 00:32:25,971
<b>Give me the number.</b>

523
00:32:25,995 --> 00:32:29,498
<b>I think I can only cooperate
if you tell me what it's about.</b>

524
00:32:29,522 --> 00:32:31,497
<b>I remember you cooperated...</b>

525
00:32:31,521 --> 00:32:33,144
<b>so willingly until now...</b>

526
00:32:33,168 --> 00:32:35,613
<b>to the point where we thought
we should have come to you first.</b>

527
00:32:35,637 --> 00:32:37,897
<b>Skip all these meaningless
gestures,</b>

528
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:39,802
<b>and give me the number.</b>

529
00:32:49,495 --> 00:32:51,213
<b>- Locate him now.
- Yes, ma'am.</b>

530
00:32:52,576 --> 00:32:54,340
<b>I hope you will cooperate...</b>

531
00:32:54,364 --> 00:32:57,278
<b>with us to the end
and not be moved with compassion.</b>

532
00:32:57,302 --> 00:32:58,788
<b>Don't you worry about that.</b>

533
00:32:59,076 --> 00:33:02,497
<b>I'm trying to separate from him.</b>

534
00:33:09,935 --> 00:33:10,966
<b>Wait.</b>

535
00:33:12,584 --> 00:33:13,646
<b>Mr. Han.</b>

536
00:33:15,341 --> 00:33:16,986
<b>- I'll drive.
- Pardon?</b>

537
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:19,928
<b>You guys stayed up all night.
Get some sleep on the way.</b>

538
00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:21,210
<b>Give me the key.</b>

539
00:33:27,879 --> 00:33:29,524
<b>(Sang Ho)</b>

540
00:33:33,202 --> 00:33:34,982
<b>- Hello?
- How did it go?</b>

541
00:33:35,051 --> 00:33:36,895
<b>I couldn't find anything
in Young Jin's house.</b>

542
00:33:36,919 --> 00:33:40,168
<b>But I found some of the residences
of the ginseng diggers in that town.</b>

543
00:33:40,193 --> 00:33:41,193
<b>I'm on my way there.</b>

544
00:33:41,242 --> 00:33:43,869
<b>Don't be sad thinking
that I always put you up...</b>

545
00:33:43,893 --> 00:33:45,549
<b>to the hardest jobs.</b>

546
00:33:45,573 --> 00:33:47,951
<b>You know that you'll be getting
the biggest reward, right?</b>

547
00:33:48,125 --> 00:33:50,125
<b>You saved me when I was dying.</b>

548
00:33:50,405 --> 00:33:53,642
<b>- I've already been rewarded.
- Be careful not to be seen.</b>

549
00:34:02,406 --> 00:34:04,132
<b>(Calling)</b>

550
00:34:08,422 --> 00:34:11,135
<b>- How long do I have to wait?
- It'll get there soon.</b>

551
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:12,230
<b>Hang up.</b>

552
00:34:37,943 --> 00:34:38,974
<b>Wait here.</b>

553
00:34:39,849 --> 00:34:42,162
<b>- What?
- You're our command center.</b>

554
00:34:42,357 --> 00:34:44,529
<b>Right. Don't get hurt.</b>

555
00:34:44,666 --> 00:34:46,104
<b>- That's an order.
- Sure.</b>

556
00:34:46,128 --> 00:34:47,251
<b>- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.</b>

557
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:14,912
<b>There's no sign of him leaving.</b>

558
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,127
<b>How long will it have been
since he escaped?</b>

559
00:35:32,151 --> 00:35:33,338
<b>It hasn't been long.</b>

560
00:35:33,363 --> 00:35:35,603
<b>Why would he have left through here
if it weren't for us?</b>

561
00:35:39,077 --> 00:35:40,231
<b>He must have seen us
through that window.</b>

562
00:35:40,255 --> 00:35:41,335
<b>He's still around here.</b>

563
00:35:45,721 --> 00:35:47,064
<b>Ms. Yoon and Mr. Lee, go that way.</b>

564
00:35:47,088 --> 00:35:48,132
<b>- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.</b>

565
00:36:07,563 --> 00:36:09,103
<b>These are live rounds now.</b>

566
00:37:10,596 --> 00:37:11,748
<b>Ms. Cha.</b>

567
00:37:17,791 --> 00:37:19,424
<b>It's over, Doo Seok.</b>

568
00:37:19,658 --> 00:37:22,089
<b>Over? Since the moment
my kidney was...</b>

569
00:37:22,136 --> 00:37:25,438
<b>replaced by someone else's,
I got an extra life.</b>

570
00:37:29,103 --> 00:37:30,877
<b>Ending it this way isn't so bad.</b>

571
00:38:00,137 --> 00:38:02,391
<b>Oh Doo Seok,
I hereby place you under arrest...</b>

572
00:38:02,674 --> 00:38:05,526
<b>for murdering Yoo Pan Sool
and attacking Ko Eun Ho.</b>

573
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:06,757
<b>You have the right to remain silent.</b>

574
00:38:06,781 --> 00:38:08,884
<b>You have the right to stop
answering at any time.</b>

575
00:38:32,455 --> 00:38:33,502
<b>Sang Ho.</b>

576
00:38:34,721 --> 00:38:37,104
<b>- What do we do with Doo Seok?
- I'm not sure.</b>

577
00:38:37,478 --> 00:38:40,204
<b>- What should we do?
- Of course, we have to save him.</b>

578
00:38:40,228 --> 00:38:41,329
<b>Wrong.</b>

579
00:38:45,934 --> 00:38:47,607
<b>What should I do?</b>

580
00:38:48,010 --> 00:38:51,553
<b>- You should listen to what he says.
- Wrong.</b>

581
00:38:52,494 --> 00:38:53,964
<b>Are you going to abandon him?</b>

582
00:38:57,158 --> 00:38:59,689
<b>He abandoned us, okay?</b>

583
00:39:01,002 --> 00:39:02,062
<b>Hee Dong.</b>

584
00:39:04,963 --> 00:39:06,525
<b>What should I do here?</b>

585
00:39:16,291 --> 00:39:18,465
<b>- Abandon him?
- Correct.</b>

586
00:40:19,597 --> 00:40:21,003
<b>Geez.</b>

587
00:40:22,464 --> 00:40:24,160
<b>Doo Seok still remains silent,
right?</b>

588
00:40:24,184 --> 00:40:27,573
<b>Ms. Yoon looks fine, but you should
go home and take some rest.</b>

589
00:40:27,597 --> 00:40:29,018
<b>I'm fine.</b>

590
00:40:29,042 --> 00:40:30,746
<b>We're not fine.</b>

591
00:40:30,770 --> 00:40:33,026
<b>Now I'm scared of you two.</b>

592
00:40:33,050 --> 00:40:34,511
<b>We'll have a meeting.</b>

593
00:40:34,831 --> 00:40:36,136
<b>Go home if you can't take part
properly.</b>

594
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,773
<b>Just go when you can.</b>

595
00:40:38,675 --> 00:40:40,661
<b>- I'll stay.
- Me too.</b>

596
00:40:40,685 --> 00:40:41,760
<b>Let's begin.</b>

597
00:40:41,784 --> 00:40:43,956
<b>How come no one here listens to me?</b>

598
00:40:44,034 --> 00:40:46,850
<b>He seems to have decided
to take all the blames.</b>

599
00:40:46,886 --> 00:40:49,454
<b>Why are we not getting
the search warrant?</b>

600
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:51,425
<b>Would there be anything left there?</b>

601
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:53,809
<b>The Millennium Hotel is going
through an all-out renovation.</b>

602
00:40:53,995 --> 00:40:56,186
<b>They must've got rid
of the cell phone and photos.</b>

603
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:06,738
<b>How did it go?</b>

604
00:41:06,762 --> 00:41:08,464
<b>We found the fingerprints...</b>

605
00:41:08,541 --> 00:41:11,039
<b>of Ki Ho and Tae Hyung
from the recorder Ki Ho gave us.</b>

606
00:41:11,063 --> 00:41:13,453
<b>We also found two different DNAs
except that of Ki Ho.</b>

607
00:41:13,477 --> 00:41:15,138
<b>One of them matches.</b>

608
00:41:15,216 --> 00:41:16,679
<b>The one from the place

<b>And after that,</b>

752

<b>in the way I believe is right,</b>

753

763
00:50:11,779 --> 00:50:13,100
<b>Yes.</b>

764
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:14,602
<b>What's the occasion?</b>

765
00:50:14,762 --> 00:50:16,461
<b>Let's go. Come out.</b>

766
00:50:16,486 --> 00:50:17,686
<b>Hurry and get ready.</b>

767
00:50:22,855 --> 00:50:24,979
<b>- This is Jang Ki Ho.
- Hello.</b>

768
00:50:28,613 --> 00:50:29,984
<b>Are you at the church now?</b>

769
00:50:30,009 --> 00:50:32,144
<b>Yes, I'm at the headquarter
of New Life Church.</b>

770
00:50:33,557 --> 00:50:34,889
<b>It's Sunday, you know.</b>

771
00:50:35,156 --> 00:50:37,558
<b>There's something
I'd like to tell the world.</b>

772
00:50:38,242 --> 00:50:40,027
<b>Will you come and hear it?</b>

773
00:50:40,361 --> 00:50:42,706
<b>Sang Ho will hear the news
and show up.</b>

774
00:50:42,730 --> 00:50:44,348
<b>That'd be great.</b>

775
00:50:44,372 --> 00:50:46,767
<b>Come so we can have
a cup of tea afterward.</b>

776
00:50:47,201 --> 00:50:49,470
<b>There's a nice set of teacups
in the Pastors' Office.</b>

777
00:50:56,710 --> 00:50:58,646
<b>Uncle, let's go.</b>

778
00:51:25,972 --> 00:51:27,168
<b>(Detective Cha Young Jin)</b>

779
00:51:45,292 --> 00:51:46,824
<b>Hello, pastor.</b>

780
00:51:47,194 --> 00:51:50,264
<b>My hotel is under construction,</b>

781
00:51:50,835 --> 00:51:52,715
<b>so I don't think
I can join the service today...</b>

782
00:51:53,678 --> 00:51:55,709
<b>Deacon Jang Ki Ho is there?</b>

783
00:51:58,457 --> 00:51:59,773
<b>Then I must be there.</b>

784
00:52:03,544 --> 00:52:06,824
<b>Let this message of life
given by the Lord...</b>

785
00:52:06,848 --> 00:52:09,994
<b>become our daily life...</b>

786
00:52:10,018 --> 00:52:11,963
<b>and give us strength.</b>

787
00:52:11,987 --> 00:52:13,497
<b>Let us be full...</b>

788
00:52:13,521 --> 00:52:16,156
<b>of comfort and peace.</b>

789
00:52:16,290 --> 00:52:19,370
<b>Through today's graceful message,</b>

790
00:52:19,394 --> 00:52:20,872
<b>let us overcome...</b>

791
00:52:20,896 --> 00:52:24,632
<b>the problems ahead of us.</b>

792
00:52:32,082 --> 00:52:34,085
<b>(Pastor Kwon Jae Chun)</b>

793
00:52:34,109 --> 00:52:37,745
<b>(Closed)</b>

794
00:52:38,746 --> 00:52:40,881
<b>Now it's time for confession.</b>

795
00:53:08,037 --> 00:53:10,037
<b>I have been born again.</b>

796
00:53:20,214 --> 00:53:22,214
<b>I have been born again.</b>

797
00:53:23,621 --> 00:53:24,735
<b>As you know,</b>

798
00:53:24,759 --> 00:53:28,062
<b>Pastor Kwon Jae Chun founded
our New Life Church.</b>

799
00:53:28,784 --> 00:53:32,032
<b>He died
of an unexpected heart attack.</b>

800
00:53:32,333 --> 00:53:34,601
<b>Recently, my heart also stopped...</b>

801
00:53:34,902 --> 00:53:37,914
<b>on the street
where there was no one.</b>

802
00:53:37,938 --> 00:53:40,075
<b>When I was guided
by the Lord's hands,</b>

803
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:42,828
<b>I saw the sight of my father,
Pastor Kwon Jae Chun.</b>

804
00:53:43,162 --> 00:53:44,841
<b>For the first time in my life,</b>

805
00:53:44,865 --> 00:53:47,800
<b>I shouted out his name all I wanted.</b>

806
00:53:49,626 --> 00:53:51,648
<b>If I followed him then,</b>

807
00:53:51,672 --> 00:53:55,208
<b>I might've met the brothers
who were going to follow me soon.</b>

808
00:53:55,773 --> 00:53:58,321
<b>My non-beating heart was in peace.</b>

809
00:53:58,345 --> 00:53:59,322
<b>But...</b>

810
00:53:59,346 --> 00:54:02,849
<b>it was suddenly grabbed
by two warm hands.</b>

811
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:05,428
<b>Then I heard a young voice...</b>

812
00:54:05,452 --> 00:54:07,320
<b>telling me desperately...</b>

813
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:09,489
<b>to open my eyes...</b>

814
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:11,924
<b>and to breathe again.</b>

815
00:54:12,058 --> 00:54:14,035
<b>At that moment,
my heart started beating again.</b>

816
00:54:14,059 --> 00:54:15,728
<b>My body...</b>

817
00:54:16,062 --> 00:54:17,541
<b>was back...</b>

818
00:54:17,565 --> 00:54:19,232
<b>with intolerable pain.</b>

819
00:54:20,172 --> 00:54:23,569
<b>After returning
from the gate of death,</b>

820
00:54:23,703 --> 00:54:25,605
<b>the first thing I saw was
the face of a boy.</b>

821
00:54:26,306 --> 00:54:28,007
<b>Covered with sweat and tears,</b>

822
00:54:28,241 --> 00:54:31,344
<b>his face seemed relieved
with pure joy.</b>

823
00:54:31,411 --> 00:54:33,223
<b>That was the first sight
of this world...</b>

824
00:54:33,247 --> 00:54:34,714
<b>after coming back to life.</b>

825
00:54:35,261 --> 00:54:37,227
<b>Kindness and sacrifice
without any cost.</b>

826
00:54:37,251 --> 00:54:39,252
<b>The delighted face of the boy.</b>

827
00:54:40,119 --> 00:54:42,689
<b>Then I realized
the true meaning of resurrection.</b>

828
00:54:43,089 --> 00:54:45,692
<b>It's meaningless
to be born again physically.</b>

829
00:54:45,959 --> 00:54:47,637
<b>Only when you're born spiritually,</b>

830
00:54:47,661 --> 00:54:50,463
<b>your groundless pain in life...</b>

831
00:54:50,530 --> 00:54:52,732
<b>can be changed to joy.</b>

832
00:54:53,363 --> 00:54:56,680
<b>Living is from your instinct.</b>

833
00:54:56,704 --> 00:54:59,772
<b>But living a humane life...</b>

834
00:54:59,939 --> 00:55:01,751
<b>is from your nature.</b>

835
00:55:01,775 --> 00:55:05,078
<b>And it'll be your joy.
There isn't any reason to it.</b>

836
00:55:05,774 --> 00:55:07,680
<b>I was away from the church,</b>

837
00:55:07,870 --> 00:55:10,516
<b>and finally for the first time,</b>

838
00:55:13,032 --> 00:55:15,172
<b>I was able to sense
the scent of joy...</b>

839
00:55:15,196 --> 00:55:17,196
<b>from someone else.</b>

840
00:55:18,422 --> 00:55:21,194
<b>Now for the rest of my life,</b>

841
00:55:21,361 --> 00:55:24,130
<b>I plan to experience the joy myself.</b>

842
00:55:24,163 --> 00:55:27,700
<b>I hope you welcome...</b>

843
00:55:27,865 --> 00:55:31,404
<b>your spiritual resurrection
and its joy...</b>

844
00:55:31,747 --> 00:55:33,606
<b>like a miracle, a gift,
or a daily life.</b>

845
00:55:37,229 --> 00:55:38,531
<b>- Amen.
- Amen.</b>

846
00:55:38,555 --> 00:55:39,756
<b>Amen.</b>

847
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:41,814
<b>- Amen.
- Amen.</b>

848
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:48,888
<b>Hey.</b>

849
00:55:49,579 --> 00:55:52,391
<b>What took you so long to show up?</b>

850
00:55:52,563 --> 00:55:54,794
<b>The temporary pastor in charge is...</b>

851
00:55:54,927 --> 00:55:56,696
<b>with the One Life Foundation.</b>

852
00:55:59,365 --> 00:56:01,734
<b>Yoon Hee Seob is in a tough spot.</b>

853
00:56:02,844 --> 00:56:04,481
<b>Anyway,</b>

854
00:56:04,505 --> 00:56:06,505
<b>I'm glad you showed up.</b>

855
00:56:10,176 --> 00:56:11,944
<b>Will you leave us alone?</b>

856
00:56:12,361 --> 00:56:14,390
<b>Look, let's talk outside.</b>

857
00:56:14,414 --> 00:56:16,900
<b>I have nothing to talk about
with you.</b>

858
00:56:16,924 --> 00:56:18,217
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

859
00:56:18,449 --> 00:56:20,426
<b>We raised the kid in the wrong way.</b>

860
00:56:20,450 --> 00:56:23,122
<b>Well, I'll let you two talk then.</b>

861
00:56:27,983 --> 00:56:31,330
<b>Do you want a cup of coffee?
Right, you like sweet coffee.</b>

862
00:56:32,133 --> 00:56:34,400
<b>Your personality has changed.</b>

863
00:56:34,997 --> 00:56:37,733
<b>I guess your sense of fear wasn't
brought back along with your life.</b>

864
00:56:37,757 --> 00:56:39,072
<b>Hey!</b>

865
00:56:39,305 --> 00:56:42,041
<b>Change your preference,
not your personality.</b>

866
00:56:42,108 --> 00:56:43,543
<b>Oh, right.</b>

867
00:56:54,954 --> 00:56:56,255
<b>It was this cup, right?</b>

868
00:57:02,249 --> 00:57:03,249
<b>Here.</b>

869
00:57:04,217 --> 00:57:05,798
<b>I know your preference.</b>

870
00:57:07,066 --> 00:57:08,499
<b>It's your preference...</b>

871
00:57:08,524 --> 00:57:11,124
<b>to decorate a worthless thing
with a flashy and expensive wrapper.</b>

872
00:57:11,993 --> 00:57:13,539
<b>Or is it your nature?</b>

873
00:57:15,675 --> 00:57:17,877
<b>I guess you're mistaken...</b>

874
00:57:18,416 --> 00:57:21,286
<b>that I can't do anything
because there are a lot of people.</b>

875
00:57:22,717 --> 00:57:23,762
<b>Sang Ho.</b>

876
00:57:27,435 --> 00:57:29,333
<b>I'm not scared of you.</b>

877
00:57:29,634 --> 00:57:30,701
<b>Why?</b>

878
00:57:31,535 --> 00:57:33,838
<b>What you desperately want...</b>

879
00:57:34,715 --> 00:57:36,570
<b>is only in my head.</b>

880
00:57:36,770 --> 00:57:39,072
<b>I just need to get rid of the book.
Don't you think so?</b>

881
00:57:43,043 --> 00:57:45,345
<b>You might know
if you have found the numbers.</b>

882
00:57:45,545 --> 00:57:47,847
<b>There are 21 numbers, right?</b>

883
00:57:48,648 --> 00:57:51,261
<b>5, 3, 4, 2, 0, 2</b>

884
00:57:51,285 --> 00:57:54,731
<b>7, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 4, 4,</b>

885
00:57:54,755 --> 00:57:57,657
<b>0, 5, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2.</b>

886
00:58:01,328 --> 00:58:02,395
<b>Right?</b>

887
00:58:02,896 --> 00:58:06,299
<b>But you can't find where your sin is
hidden with these numbers.</b>

888
00:58:13,820 --> 00:58:16,242
<b>What is it that you want?</b>

889
00:58:17,484 --> 00:58:19,832
<b>- The hotel?
- Ko Eun Ho.</b>

890
00:58:21,246 --> 00:58:23,116
<b>- What?
- Eun Ho's safety.</b>

891
00:58:24,426 --> 00:58:26,426
<b>Don't mess with him from now on.</b>

892
00:58:27,354 --> 00:58:29,890
<b>There's no statute of limitations
to my father's deal.</b>

893
00:58:30,156 --> 00:58:32,759
<b>Like your sin, I mean.</b>

894
00:58:33,226 --> 00:58:36,073
<b>So that boy has to be safe
from you forever.</b>

895
00:58:36,097 --> 00:58:37,330
<b>If then,</b>

896
00:58:37,964 --> 00:58:40,066
<b>you'll also be safe forever.</b>

897
00:58:45,396 --> 00:58:48,074
<b>What do you mean,
the statute of limitations?</b>

898
00:58:51,144 --> 00:58:53,504
<b>Lim Hee Jung's case doesn't have
any statute of limitations.</b>

899
00:58:53,647 --> 00:58:56,182
<b>While you were with Cha Young Jin,</b>

900
00:58:57,083 --> 00:58:58,618
<b>what did you two talk about?</b>

901
00:59:01,798 --> 00:59:02,966
<b>I don't know.</b>

902
00:59:08,261 --> 00:59:09,329
<b>Sang Ho.</b>

903
00:59:10,278 --> 00:59:13,400
<b>I don't think
Sang Won killed Hee Jung.</b>

904
00:59:24,827 --> 00:59:26,312
<b>Ki Ho.</b>

905
00:59:26,832 --> 00:59:30,603
<b>You don't know anything about him.</b>

906
00:59:31,051 --> 00:59:32,085
<b>Okay?</b>

907
00:59:33,086 --> 00:59:35,288
<b>Pastor Seo Sang Won...</b>

908
00:59:35,534 --> 00:59:37,457
<b>loved me so much.</b>

909
00:59:39,405 --> 00:59:41,428
<b>What he could do for me.</b>

910
00:59:46,232 --> 00:59:48,601
<b>Don't worry. I won't tell anyone.</b>

911
00:59:49,539 --> 00:59:50,675
<b>Stay away from each other.</b>

912
00:59:57,816 --> 00:59:59,346
<b>Why would you show him this?</b>

913
01:00:02,346 --> 01:00:03,402
<b>Get out.</b>

914
01:00:03,426 --> 01:00:05,762
<b>Is Ki Ho under your protection?</b>

915
01:00:05,786 --> 01:00:06,853
<b>Yes.</b>

916
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:10,056
<b>He has the book, and he's
the only one who can solve the map.</b>

917
01:00:11,777 --> 01:00:12,959
