1
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:10,320
<b>What?</b>

2
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:13,460
<b>Pack up and move back home.</b>

3
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:15,830
<b>But Dad...</b>

4
00:00:16,099 --> 00:00:17,560
<b>You both said it's over.</b>

5
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:21,300
<b>So don't make excuses
about the house price...</b>

6
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,769
<b>and come back home.</b>

7
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:27,186
<b>I never thought of moving back in
after the divorce though.</b>

8
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:29,039
<b>I didn't ask for your opinion.</b>

9
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:30,910
<b>Just move back in.</b>

10
00:00:31,649 --> 00:00:33,326
<b>We let you do what you want...</b>

11
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:34,925
<b>because we thought
you had your life under control,</b>

12
00:00:34,949 --> 00:00:36,750
<b>but all you did was look down on us.</b>

13
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:40,590
<b>Would you have done such a thing
if you respected us?</b>

14
00:00:43,259 --> 00:00:44,560
<b>You have one day.</b>

15
00:00:45,189 --> 00:00:48,060
<b>Pack up your things
and move back home. Got it?</b>

16
00:00:59,939 --> 00:01:01,880
<b>Should I call her?</b>

17
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:10,850
<b>My gosh, what happened?
Did you find your mother?</b>

18
00:01:11,219 --> 00:01:14,489
<b>Yes, she came back home
around dinner time.</b>

19
00:01:16,819 --> 00:01:20,230
<b>Is she all right?
Where on earth was she?</b>

20
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:23,129
<b>I don't know.
She probably got some fresh air.</b>

21
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:25,000
<b>Right.</b>

22
00:01:26,569 --> 00:01:29,215
<b>Couldn't you have at least texted me
when you found out?</b>

23
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:30,939
<b>You know how worried I was.</b>

24
00:01:32,569 --> 00:01:34,069
<b>What on earth do you need those for?</b>

25
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:37,310
<b>It's to pack up my things.</b>

26
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:40,549
<b>I'm moving back home.</b>

27
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:42,480
<b>Dad told me to.</b>

28
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:47,849
<b>I don't have a choice.</b>

29
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,959
<b>You know how scary my dad can be
when he's angry.</b>

30
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:09,079
<b>Let me get your books for you.
You can pack your clothes.</b>

31
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,969
<b>Do you have everything?</b>

32
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:41,979
<b>Think if you've left
anything behind.</b>

33
00:02:42,379 --> 00:02:44,039
<b>I checked and I have everything.</b>

34
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:48,550
<b>We'll sort out the furniture
when we sell the house.</b>

35
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,050
<b>Sure thing.</b>

36
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:00,659
<b>I thought about us while packing up.</b>

37
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:04,729
<b>We had rough moments
over the three and a half years,</b>

38
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,520
<b>but there were
a lot of good times too.</b>

39
00:03:08,569 --> 00:03:09,669
<b>Gyu Jin,</b>

40
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,370
<b>it must've been tough
living with me.</b>

41
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:16,740
<b>The same goes for you too.</b>

42
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:21,750
<b>I nagged about everything
and my mom wasn't the easiest.</b>

43
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:28,289
<b>Are we trying too hard
to part on a good note?</b>

44
00:03:30,189 --> 00:03:31,430
<b>I mean what I said.</b>

45
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:33,759
<b>I was sorry.</b>

46
00:03:34,729 --> 00:03:35,960
<b>And thank you.</b>

47
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,500
<b>Sure. We'll go back to
being good colleagues now.</b>

48
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,169
<b>You know I'm an outcast
at the hospital.</b>

49
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,909
<b>I'm counting on you to tell me
where they switched meetings to.</b>

50
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:51,955
<b>Or I guess I could ask
my former brother-in-law.</b>

51
00:03:51,979 --> 00:03:54,150
<b>He's clumsier than he seems.</b>

52
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:55,959
<b>You're better off
trusting me with it.</b>

53
00:03:56,949 --> 00:03:59,050
<b>Confide in me with
your love life if you need to.</b>

54
00:03:59,349 --> 00:04:01,620
<b>I'll hear about it at work anyway,</b>

55
00:04:01,659 --> 00:04:03,520
<b>so don't make it awkward
by trying to hide it.</b>

56
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,689
<b>Even after all this,</b>

57
00:04:06,189 --> 00:04:09,729
<b>I'll still be the woman
who knows you the best.</b>

58
00:04:11,629 --> 00:04:13,300
<b>I might come to you day and night.</b>

59
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:15,010
<b>Are you sure you can handle it?</b>

60
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:16,840
<b>As if.</b>

61
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:06,120
<b>I'll get going.</b>

62
00:05:08,389 --> 00:05:09,519
<b>Sure.</b>

63
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:06,110
<b>I knew it.</b>

64
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:10,319
<b>It's why I told her to check.</b>

65
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,300
<b>I guess I'm back.</b>

66
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:28,699
<b>I'm home!</b>

67
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:32,970
<b>Mom?</b>

68
00:06:33,569 --> 00:06:35,555
<b>Madam Jang, you're awake.</b>

69
00:06:35,579 --> 00:06:36,779
<b>How are you feeling, Mom?</b>

70
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:39,009
<b>She seems okay to me.</b>

71
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:41,925
<b>- She seems better, right?
- Yes.</b>

72
00:06:41,949 --> 00:06:44,425
<b>Let's be quick on our feet
and help her out today.</b>

73
00:06:44,449 --> 00:06:46,420
<b>- Sure.
- Of course.</b>

74
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,360
<b>My gosh, Na Hee.</b>

75
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:50,336
<b>- Na Hee?
- Na Hee?</b>

76
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,406
<b>What are you doing here this early?</b>

77
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:54,505
<b>Can you look shocked
while helping me with my luggage?</b>

78
00:06:54,529 --> 00:06:55,660
<b>Of course.</b>

79
00:06:55,699 --> 00:06:59,000
<b>Dad, Mom, Na Hee is home!</b>

80
00:07:05,139 --> 00:07:06,170
<b>You're home.</b>

81
00:07:07,709 --> 00:07:08,810
<b>Hi, Dad.</b>

82
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:10,639
<b>Mom,</b>

83
00:07:11,379 --> 00:07:12,579
<b>I'm home.</b>

84
00:07:19,889 --> 00:07:20,889
<b>What...</b>

85
00:07:23,389 --> 00:07:26,029
<b>Go ahead and unpack first.</b>

86
00:07:26,829 --> 00:07:27,860
<b>He's right.</b>

87
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:30,360
<b>What's going on?</b>

88
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:35,646
<b>Just hear me out, honey.</b>

89
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:37,115
<b>Are you kidding me?</b>

90
00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:39,040
<b>How could you do this
without asking me?</b>

91
00:07:39,069 --> 00:07:40,386
<b>Honey, please.</b>

92
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:42,555
<b>I still can't look
at her right now.</b>

93
00:07:42,579 --> 00:07:44,086
<b>I'm still angry at her.</b>

94
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:46,055
<b>It's why I told her to move back in.</b>

95
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:47,886
<b>So that you can vent.</b>

96
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:49,456
<b>You're angry with her, right?</b>

97
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:52,795
<b>So target your anger at her
whenever you feel like it...</b>

98
00:07:52,819 --> 00:07:54,125
<b>until your anger subsides.</b>

99
00:07:54,149 --> 00:07:57,089
<b>Just saying whatever you want
doesn't make it reasonable.</b>

100
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:00,029
<b>What nonsense are you spewing?
Gosh, my head.</b>

101
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:02,600
<b>Do you have a headache?</b>

102
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:04,660
<b>Hold on a second.</b>

103
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:07,029
<b>(Aspirin)</b>

104
00:08:08,769 --> 00:08:11,069
<b>Here you go, honey.</b>

105
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,339
<b>Take this.</b>

106
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:15,509
<b>Forget it. Is this a joke to you?</b>

107
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,180
<b>But you said you have a headache.</b>

108
00:08:19,009 --> 00:08:20,949
<b>Whatever then.</b>

109
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:24,319
<b>I have a headache too now,
so I'll take it.</b>

110
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:27,389
<b>Give me that.</b>

111
00:08:32,029 --> 00:08:33,290
<b>Gosh, my head.</b>

112
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:36,560
<b>I had no idea you'd be back,
so the room is a mess.</b>

113
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:39,206
<b>You can take the bed.</b>

114
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:41,429
<b>I know you can't sleep
on hard surfaces.</b>

115
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:45,269
<b>It's fine. I'm not a monster
who takes whatever she wants.</b>

116
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:47,586
<b>How can you say that
when we're family?</b>

117
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,909
<b>It's fine. You take the bed.
I can't sleep just about anywhere.</b>

118
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,226
<b>Are you sure about that?</b>

119
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:55,779
<b>Yes, of course. No problem!</b>

120
00:08:56,649 --> 00:08:58,990
<b>Thanks. I'll take the bed then.</b>

121
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:03,019
<b>My books will soon be delivered.
Is there any space for them?</b>

122
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:06,306
<b>Sure. You can take up
all the shelves.</b>

123
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:08,360
<b>All I need is
this section right here.</b>

124
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:11,769
<b>Shouldn't you have more books...</b>

125
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,769
<b>since you're studying
to go back to college?</b>

126
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,700
<b>What? Oh, right.</b>

127
00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:19,139
<b>Well, I haven't been able
to get very far yet.</b>

128
00:09:19,269 --> 00:09:21,039
<b>I'll buy more soon
as well as a workbook.</b>

129
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:26,610
<b>Isn't it better to study
for the university's English test...</b>

130
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,750
<b>rather than a nationwide
proficiency test?</b>

131
00:09:28,779 --> 00:09:31,125
<b>The college you're applying to
asks essay questions for math.</b>

132
00:09:31,149 --> 00:09:33,495
<b>You'll need to study statistics,
so where are you on that?</b>

133
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:36,620
<b>Right, I should get on that.</b>

134
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,690
<b>Kids, get down here!</b>

135
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:42,830
<b>You heard that, right?
We're being summoned.</b>

136
00:09:44,259 --> 00:09:45,700
<b>This early in the morning?</b>

137
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:54,070
<b>Since you're all here,
you should say hello.</b>

138
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:57,056
<b>At the far end is Na Hee,
my second daughter.</b>

139
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,279
<b>These two
are Joon Seon's colleagues.</b>

140
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:01,720
<b>- I'm Oh Jeong Bong.
- I'm Lee Jong Soo.</b>

141
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:04,379
<b>I'm Park Hyo Sin,
the part-time delivery guy.</b>

142
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,419
<b>I know. I hope we get along.</b>

143
00:10:06,919 --> 00:10:08,995
<b>I see that we're
quite a big family now.</b>

144
00:10:09,019 --> 00:10:10,265
<b>How many are there exactly?</b>

145
00:10:10,289 --> 00:10:12,365
<b>2, 4, 6, 8, 9.</b>

146
00:10:12,389 --> 00:10:14,190
<b>Mom makes 10 in total.</b>

147
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:18,629
<b>What? Really? 10 people? No way.</b>

148
00:10:19,269 --> 00:10:21,740
<b>We're all living under
the same roof now,</b>

149
00:10:21,769 --> 00:10:22,899
<b>so get along.</b>

150
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:25,785
<b>Some may know this and some may not,</b>

151
00:10:25,809 --> 00:10:28,909
<b>but we clean the entire house
every weekend.</b>

152
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,826
<b>Like always,</b>

153
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:34,485
<b>you're responsible
for your own living spaces.</b>

154
00:10:34,509 --> 00:10:36,926
<b>The men will clean the bathrooms,
the women will clean the kitchen,</b>

155
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:40,696
<b>and those living up top
will clean the living room.</b>

156
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,659
<b>Dad, I have a question.</b>

157
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:45,905
<b>Why are we in charge
of cleaning the living room?</b>

158
00:10:45,929 --> 00:10:48,306
<b>She's the one who spends
most of her time here.</b>

159
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:49,576
<b>She's here nearly 24-7.</b>

160
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,169
<b>How is it fair for four guys to
only clean that tiny room upstairs?</b>

161
00:10:53,269 --> 00:10:55,946
<b>The fact that the four of us
live in that tiny space...</b>

162
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:57,015
<b>should be a mitigating factor.</b>

163
00:10:57,039 --> 00:10:58,515
<b>Have you not heard of
weighing the pros and cons?</b>

164
00:10:58,539 --> 00:10:59,816
<b>Shut it, you two.</b>

165
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:03,485
<b>Ga Hee can clean up
some of the space then, okay?</b>

166
00:11:03,509 --> 00:11:05,809
<b>Wise as always, Dad. Salute!</b>

167
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:09,296
<b>I'll help out
cleaning the living room.</b>

168
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:12,226
<b>It's all right.
I'll take care of it.</b>

169
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:13,490
<b>You can stick to our room.</b>

170
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:17,735
<b>I'm sorry, Dad,
but I need to sleep in late...</b>

171
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:19,690
<b>to recharge my energy on weekends.</b>

172
00:11:20,259 --> 00:11:22,206
<b>Could I pay a fine instead?</b>

173
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:23,706
<b>A fine?</b>

174
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:25,476
<b>We can order Chinese food with that.</b>

175
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,375
<b>Right. Make it a steep fine...</b>

176
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:28,816
<b>so that we can order
some fancy dishes.</b>

177
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:31,169
<b>That's enough.
Don't you dare get cheeky with me.</b>

178
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:34,216
<b>There will be no exceptions
as long as you live here.</b>

179
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,039
<b>It's our rule to clean on weekends,</b>

180
00:11:36,139 --> 00:11:37,710
<b>so stick to it. All right?</b>

181
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:39,379
<b>- Right.
- Sure.</b>

182
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:45,149
<b>Over there. Yes, get that area too.</b>

183
00:11:45,419 --> 00:11:46,450
<b>Over here, Ga Hee?</b>

184
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:47,549
<b>That's right.</b>

185
00:11:48,889 --> 00:11:51,009
<b>We need to finish up here
and clean the porch as well.</b>

186
00:11:51,259 --> 00:11:53,090
<b>I see you're not very agile.</b>

187
00:11:55,629 --> 00:11:59,269
<b>You've got to be kidding me.
Are you still ordering him around?</b>

188
00:11:59,429 --> 00:12:00,870
<b>I'm cleaning too.</b>

189
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:15,980
<b>Hold on.</b>

190
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,865
<b>Can you shake this out
if you have some extra energy?</b>

191
00:12:19,889 --> 00:12:21,120
<b>My arms aren't strong enough.</b>

192
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:22,389
<b>Sure.</b>

193
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:28,929
<b>I knew it.</b>

194
00:12:31,529 --> 00:12:34,799
<b>Gosh, look at those
shoulders and biceps.</b>

195
00:12:35,539 --> 00:12:36,669
<b>Have you been working out?</b>

196
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:42,279
<b>You seem strong enough to me,
so do it yourself.</b>

197
00:12:45,509 --> 00:12:47,080
<b>What was that all about?</b>

198
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:51,080
<b>He's a total jerk,
but a charming one.</b>

199
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:57,289
<b>I'll do that, Na Hee. You can rest.</b>

200
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,759
<b>It's fine.
I'd rather not get kicked out.</b>

201
00:13:00,659 --> 00:13:02,330
<b>Where else do we clean? The kitchen?</b>

202
00:13:03,159 --> 00:13:04,159
<b>Yes.</b>

203
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:06,576
<b>- Jong Soo.
- Yes.</b>

204
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,700
<b>Can you help out over here?</b>

205
00:13:10,269 --> 00:13:14,309
<b>Don't slack off over there.
Put some force into the scrubbing.</b>

206
00:13:16,009 --> 00:13:18,279
<b>Just so you know,
nagging is a trigger for me.</b>

207
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:22,149
<b>I'm just sick and tired of this,
you know.</b>

208
00:13:23,019 --> 00:13:24,025
<b>Dad shouldn't make us pay rent...</b>

209
00:13:24,049 --> 00:13:26,090
<b>if he's putting us
to work like this.</b>

210
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:31,220
<b>What's up, Mom?
We're almost done cleaning here.</b>

211
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:34,405
<b>Bring the radishes from storage
to the living room.</b>

212
00:13:34,429 --> 00:13:35,676
<b>We're making kkakdugi.</b>

213
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:36,730
<b>Right now?</b>

214
00:13:37,629 --> 00:13:39,500
<b>Can't we take a short break first?</b>

215
00:13:40,629 --> 00:13:41,870
<b>I'll get them.</b>

216
00:13:42,039 --> 00:13:45,070
<b>I just have to bring them
all out from storage, right?</b>

217
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,450
<b>Aren't I good at chopping these?</b>

218
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:00,096
<b>This is why the men
should be in the kitchen.</b>

219
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:03,035
<b>We'd appreciate it more
if you did it quietly.</b>

220
00:14:03,059 --> 00:14:04,596
<b>I'm already pulling my weight.</b>

221
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:07,230
<b>Look at Na Hee for instance.
They're all uneven.</b>

222
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:10,159
<b>Mom, aren't I better at this
than Na Hee?</b>

223
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:16,299
<b>"Joon Seon spoke
but his mom didn't respond."</b>

224
00:14:19,909 --> 00:14:22,879
<b>Mom, how about an apron?
I'll get one for you.</b>

225
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:24,740
<b>No, let me.</b>

226
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,809
<b>It's fine. I don't need one.</b>

227
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,490
<b>My back is killing me.</b>

228
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:45,799
<b>Na Hee, come on.
Let's hit the sauna.</b>

229
00:14:46,929 --> 00:14:48,505
<b>The sauna?</b>

230
00:14:48,529 --> 00:14:50,615
<b>Don't say that
like it's news to you.</b>

231
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,570
<b>We always used to go there
on Sundays.</b>

232
00:14:52,669 --> 00:14:54,169
<b>And besides,</b>

233
00:14:54,269 --> 00:14:56,550
<b>we each get a dollar discount
for a group of five or more.</b>

234
00:14:56,679 --> 00:14:57,879
<b>I forgot about all that.</b>

235
00:14:58,539 --> 00:14:59,855
<b>Anyway, count me out.</b>

236
00:14:59,879 --> 00:15:02,379
<b>Don't be ridiculous. Let's go.</b>

237
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:06,649
<b>I haven't been to
a public sauna in ages.</b>

238
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:09,635
<b>Stop fighting with me on this.
Let's go.</b>

239
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:11,495
<b>What will you do
all alone at home anyway?</b>

240
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:15,206
<b>It'll be refreshing
to scrub your back.</b>

241
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:18,029
<b>But I don't want to!</b>

242
00:15:18,129 --> 00:15:21,200
<b>Are you seriously
talking back to your sister?</b>

243
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:24,676
<b>Get up already. Up!</b>

244
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,710
<b>- Get up!
- What the...</b>

245
00:15:27,269 --> 00:15:29,556
<b>Goodness, how refreshing.</b>

246
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:30,840
<b>Tell me about it.</b>

247
00:15:33,009 --> 00:15:35,450
<b>They should be out by now.
Oh, there they are.</b>

248
00:15:35,879 --> 00:15:39,466
<b>Ladies, this is a surprise.
You're never out here on time.</b>

249
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:42,059
<b>I didn't want to hear you nag,
so I left without drying my hair.</b>

250
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:44,296
<b>Anyway, you have no idea
how filthy Da Hee was.</b>

251
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,306
<b>I had to scrub her back forever.</b>

252
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:47,759
<b>I can't even feel my arms.</b>

253
00:15:47,929 --> 00:15:50,235
<b>What are you talking about?
That's not true.</b>

254
00:15:50,259 --> 00:15:52,405
<b>The drain was clogged up
after I scrubbed your back.</b>

255
00:15:52,429 --> 00:15:54,230
<b>- Are you crazy?
- That's enough.</b>

256
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,015
<b>Did you get to relax your muscles
in the warm water?</b>

257
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:59,145
<b>Let's just go. I'm hungry.</b>

258
00:15:59,169 --> 00:16:00,146
<b>Okay. Let's go.</b>

259
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:02,080
<b>Come with me, Madam Jang.</b>

260
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:08,980
<b>Get off me. That's annoying.</b>

261
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:13,990
<b>You're being so prickly.</b>

262
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:18,120
<b>Let's go.</b>

263
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,570
<b>Hey, don't mind her.</b>

264
00:16:29,799 --> 00:16:31,299
<b>Weren't you prepared for this?</b>

265
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:33,509
<b>That's true.</b>

266
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:36,639
<b>Mom needs some time.</b>

267
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:40,149
<b>Just consider it your punishment
and bear with it.</b>

268
00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:42,950
<b>Joon Seon and I went through
the same thing.</b>

269
00:16:45,149 --> 00:16:48,090
<b>It's just that Mom seems
distressed to see me.</b>

270
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:50,360
<b>Of course she's distressed.</b>

271
00:16:51,789 --> 00:16:54,659
<b>But I think Dad told you
to move in for a good reason.</b>

272
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:56,529
<b>So you should keep facing her.</b>

273
00:16:57,159 --> 00:16:58,830
<b>That's the only option you have.</b>

274
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:02,769
<b>I'm not sure
if it would work for Mom though.</b>

275
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:06,470
<b>Just hang in there.</b>

276
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:23,095
<b>Why is she so skinny?</b>

277
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:24,759
<b>It looks like
she hasn't eaten anything.</b>

278
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:27,829
<b>Is she trying to show me
how hard it has been or what?</b>

279
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,539
<b>This is perfect.</b>

280
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:44,055
<b>This is where it belongs.</b>

281
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:46,650
<b>But I had to keep it
stuffed away in storage.</b>

282
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,009
<b>I love it.</b>

283
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:50,619
<b>This is very nice.</b>

284
00:17:56,789 --> 00:17:58,229
<b>I should set up
the game console too.</b>

285
00:17:58,390 --> 00:17:59,559
<b>Where is that thing?</b>

286
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,529
<b>She forgot to take this too.</b>

287
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,970
<b>She is such a handful.</b>

288
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:18,539
<b>I should bring this to her.
She wears it often.</b>

289
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:27,190
<b>Who...</b>

290
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:29,789
<b>- Gosh.
- Come and take this.</b>

291
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,960
<b>- Gosh, Mom.
- Hey.</b>

292
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:35,799
<b>What are you doing here?
You didn't even call.</b>

293
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:38,099
<b>Do I have to call ahead to visit?</b>

294
00:18:38,259 --> 00:18:40,000
<b>You live alone now anyway.</b>

295
00:18:41,269 --> 00:18:43,470
<b>I thought Jae Seok was
being inquisitive.</b>

296
00:18:43,799 --> 00:18:46,269
<b>That's right.
I told him to spy on you. So what?</b>

297
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:49,440
<b>If she didn't move out,
I would've taken you to my place.</b>

298
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:52,585
<b>Why would you live with her
when you are divorced?</b>

299
00:18:52,609 --> 00:18:56,126
<b>We just did it
since we couldn't sell the house...</b>

300
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:58,426
<b>That's enough.
I don't want to hear it.</b>

301
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:00,819
<b>I got you new bedsheets...</b>

302
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:04,065
<b>and a few cushions.
Go ahead and change them.</b>

303
00:19:04,089 --> 00:19:06,436
<b>Why bother?
What I have here are new.</b>

304
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:08,259
<b>They are what she chose.</b>

305
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:12,075
<b>We will change them all.
Even the curtains.</b>

306
00:19:12,099 --> 00:19:13,269
<b>What?</b>

307
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:16,440
<b>What is this?</b>

308
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:20,716
<b>- Isn't this her shirt?
- Yes, it is.</b>

309
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:23,839
<b>She moved out in a hurry,
so she forgot to bring it.</b>

310
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,126
<b>So? Will you fold it nicely
and bring it to her or something?</b>

311
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:31,420
<b>Of course. I don't need it here.
And she wears it often.</b>

312
00:19:34,049 --> 00:19:35,420
<b>Gosh, Mom.</b>

313
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:40,130
<b>You're divorced.</b>

314
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:43,230
<b>You don't have to
bring her a shirt she forgot.</b>

315
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:46,130
<b>I'm not happy with you two
working at the same hospital.</b>

316
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:49,269
<b>Can't she find a new job?
She says she's competent.</b>

317
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:54,245
<b>Come on out and eat.</b>

318
00:19:54,269 --> 00:19:56,339
<b>Joon Seon.
Come downstairs with the guys.</b>

319
00:19:57,109 --> 00:19:58,210
<b>Okay.</b>

320
00:20:02,009 --> 00:20:04,079
<b>Mom, what's with the feast?</b>

321
00:20:04,279 --> 00:20:05,720
<b>Did you cook all these?</b>

322
00:20:06,019 --> 00:20:07,896
<b>Who else would it be then?</b>

323
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,519
<b>Stop being silly and have a seat.</b>

324
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:12,660
<b>Enjoy your food. You probably
haven't eaten well for a while.</b>

325
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:16,876
<b>All right. Let's have a seat.</b>

326
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,799
<b>- Okay.
- Thank you for the food.</b>

327
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:23,269
<b>Mom, you should sit
and eat with us too.</b>

328
00:20:24,339 --> 00:20:26,069
<b>Na Hee, come here.</b>

329
00:20:34,049 --> 00:20:36,920
<b>All right. Let's eat.</b>

330
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:39,920
<b>- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you.</b>

331
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:45,166
<b>My mom's doenjang jjigae
is the best.</b>

332
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:48,406
<b>Do you guys know that
this can't be bought for money?</b>

333
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:49,436
<b>You know, right?</b>

334
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:50,599
<b>Of course.</b>

335
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:54,029
<b>Ms. Jang, your doenjang jjigae
is truly impressive.</b>

336
00:20:54,829 --> 00:20:55,946
<b>He's right.</b>

337
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:58,299
<b>It's so good
that I feel like crying.</b>

338
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:02,170
<b>Right. It's really good.</b>

339
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:06,250
<b>You don't have to try so hard.
Just enjoy your meal.</b>

340
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:07,650
<b>- Okay.
- Yes, ma'am.</b>

341
00:21:10,849 --> 00:21:13,549
<b>It's Na Hee's favorite,
seasoned eggplant. Ga Hee.</b>

342
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:14,789
<b>Try this.</b>

343
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:17,059
<b>Here. Eat a lot.</b>

344
00:21:17,259 --> 00:21:18,960
<b>Is she the only one eating here?</b>

345
00:21:19,089 --> 00:21:20,789
<b>I made it for everyone to share.</b>

346
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:45,019
<b>Gosh, I've been through
a lot lately because of Na Hee.</b>

347
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:50,765
<b>Hey, Seo Young.</b>

348
00:21:50,789 --> 00:21:51,866
<b>What are you doing, Dad?</b>

349
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:55,190
<b>Me? I'm just lying down
after having a big dinner.</b>

350
00:21:55,259 --> 00:21:57,106
<b>Did you eat dinner?</b>

351
00:21:57,130 --> 00:21:58,930
<b>Not yet. I'm eating soon.</b>

352
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:02,416
<b>Dad. I have big news.
Guess what it is.</b>

353
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,799
<b>What is it?</b>

354
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:07,910
<b>I just got the test results
from the academy.</b>

355
00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:10,356
<b>And my grades went up by 20 points.
Isn't that great?</b>

356
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:12,140
<b>What? Really?</b>

357
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:14,410
<b>How could you do that?</b>

358
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:16,779
<b>It makes me worried though.</b>

359
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:18,356
<b>You're so pretty.</b>

360
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:20,666
<b>Now that you're even smart,
what if your friends hate you?</b>

361
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:24,460
<b>Don't worry about it. I'm like you,
so I have a great personality too.</b>

362
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:27,730
<b>Dad, since I got good grades,</b>

363
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:30,176
<b>can you do me a favor?</b>

364
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,636
<b>Of course.</b>

365
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:34,170
<b>I can do you 10 favors. What is it?</b>

366
00:22:38,099 --> 00:22:41,069
<b>I can't tell you right now.
I'll get back to you soon.</b>

367
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:43,740
<b>You have to do me a favor.
Promise me.</b>

368
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:47,055
<b>So if you're in your room,</b>

369
00:22:47,079 --> 00:22:49,420
<b>is the cute guy there too?</b>

370
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:52,426
<b>You know, the guy who works
at Grandpa's store.</b>

371
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:54,349
<b>Yes. He's here. Why?</b>

372
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:56,636
<b>Can I talk to him?</b>

373
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:58,990
<b>It's been a few days,
so I'm afraid he might forget me.</b>

374
00:22:59,089 --> 00:23:00,759
<b>Then it would be hard for me...</b>

375
00:23:06,329 --> 00:23:08,775
<b>Gosh, he's jealous again.</b>

376
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:10,416
<b>You're so cute, Dad.</b>

377
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,745
<b>Seo Young, dinner.</b>

378
00:23:12,769 --> 00:23:13,809
<b>Okay.</b>

379
00:23:15,509 --> 00:23:16,616
<b>- Mom.
- Yes?</b>

380
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,680
<b>Ta-da.</b>

381
00:23:17,809 --> 00:23:18,980
<b>What's that?</b>

382
00:23:20,779 --> 00:23:22,349
<b>- Is it for the recent test?
- Yes.</b>

383
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:27,089
<b>It improved a lot.</b>

384
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:29,589
<b>See? You can do this.</b>

385
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:32,559
<b>Come here. I'm so proud of you.</b>

386
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:34,906
<b>Yes, Mom, I know I'm amazing.</b>

387
00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:37,035
<b>You didn't forget your promise,
did you?</b>

388
00:23:37,059 --> 00:23:38,805
<b>You said that you'd grant my wish
if I made it into the top 10.</b>

389
00:23:38,829 --> 00:23:40,706
<b>Of course I'll keep my promise.
What is it?</b>

390
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:42,299
<b>- Do you want a new phone?
- No.</b>

391
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:44,400
<b>Let's eat out together as a family.</b>

392
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:47,539
<b>With Dad. Like other families.</b>

393
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:51,210
<b>I checked your schedules.</b>

394
00:23:51,309 --> 00:23:53,349
<b>Tomorrow is Seo Jin's
Kindergarten interview, right?</b>

395
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:55,920
<b>I guess we can eat after that.</b>

396
00:23:56,279 --> 00:23:59,950
<b>You're not going to go back
on your word, are you?</b>

397
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,390
<b>- Are you sleeping already?
- What?</b>

398
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:39,589
<b>No.</b>

399
00:24:39,759 --> 00:24:41,765
<b>I was going to turn off
the light for you.</b>

400
00:24:41,789 --> 00:24:44,275
<b>I can study with the desk lamp on.</b>

401
00:24:44,299 --> 00:24:46,930
<b>It's okay. I'm fine.</b>

402
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:50,339
<b>All right. Thank you, Na Hee.</b>

403
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:23,440
<b>Was this bed always so big?</b>

404
00:25:29,609 --> 00:25:31,555
<b>Done. Jong Soo, let's move on.</b>

405
00:25:31,579 --> 00:25:32,650
<b>Okay.</b>

406
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:34,180
<b>Next.</b>

407
00:25:36,779 --> 00:25:38,180
<b>I'm sorry, guys.</b>

408
00:25:38,349 --> 00:25:40,126
<b>The mood at home has been
so serious lately,</b>

409
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:43,289
<b>so we can't do our morning workouts
or chat comfortably in the house.</b>

410
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:44,496
<b>It's fine, Joon Seon.</b>

411
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,305
<b>I prefer to exercise outdoors.</b>

412
00:25:46,329 --> 00:25:47,866
<b>Me too. It's nice and cool.</b>

413
00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:49,460
<b>Really? That's a relief, then.</b>

414
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,160
<b>But why won't anyone hire us?</b>

415
00:25:52,359 --> 00:25:54,369
<b>Should I hand out
more business cards next week?</b>

416
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:59,140
<b>- Hey, Hyun Gyung.
- Can you talk?</b>

417
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,539
<b>Yes, of course. Go ahead.</b>

418
00:26:00,609 --> 00:26:03,180
<b>You haven't forgotten Seo Jin's
interview this afternoon, right?</b>

419
00:26:04,009 --> 00:26:05,656
<b>It's at 4 p.m. You can't be late.</b>

420
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:08,656
<b>I may be scatterbrained,
but I wouldn't forget that.</b>

421
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,450
<b>Don't worry. Trust me.</b>

422
00:26:10,549 --> 00:26:12,626
<b>Shall I meet you at
the address you texted?</b>

423
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:13,995
<b>Will it take about an hour?</b>

424
00:26:14,019 --> 00:26:16,890
<b>Yes. The interview
will be over in an hour.</b>

425
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:20,936
<b>Free up a few hours after as well.</b>

426
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,460
<b>Why? Is there something else?</b>

427
00:26:23,029 --> 00:26:24,936
<b>No. Let's have dinner together.</b>

428
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,529
<b>Seo Young wants to eat out
as a family.</b>

429
00:26:26,599 --> 00:26:28,730
<b>- It's her wish.
- We'll really...</b>

430
00:26:30,599 --> 00:26:32,146
<b>- Joon Seon!
- Are you all right?</b>

431
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:34,670
<b>Why? Do you have plans afterwards?</b>

432
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:36,210
<b>Are you not free?</b>

433
00:26:36,509 --> 00:26:38,240
<b>No, no.</b>

434
00:26:38,279 --> 00:26:40,426
<b>Of course I'm free. I'm free.</b>

435
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:42,750
<b>I'll see you later. Bye.</b>

436
00:26:42,849 --> 00:26:44,349
<b>Oh, yes. Oh, yes.</b>

437
00:26:57,230 --> 00:27:00,099
<b>My gosh.
Your jaw might touch the floor.</b>

438
00:27:00,130 --> 00:27:01,369
<b>Did you not sleep?</b>

439
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,569
<b>Does Na Hee snore?</b>

440
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:05,000
<b>No. It's worse than that.</b>

441
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,569
<b>You don't want to know.</b>

442
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:13,555
<b>You're leaving already?
Before breakfast?</b>

443
00:27:13,579 --> 00:27:15,849
<b>Yes. I think I should leave
with time to spare.</b>

444
00:27:16,779 --> 00:27:18,926
<b>Dad, I'm leaving for work.</b>

445
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:20,750
<b>Okay, take care.</b>

446
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:24,359
<b>Mom. I'm going out.</b>

447
00:27:28,529 --> 00:27:29,759
<b>See you, Ga Hee.</b>

448
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,730
<b>Have a nice day.</b>

449
00:27:32,059 --> 00:27:33,829
<b>Cheer up, sister. Good luck.</b>

450
00:27:37,599 --> 00:27:39,299
<b>What a terrible sight.</b>

451
00:27:39,569 --> 00:27:41,240
<b>She's like me three years ago.</b>

452
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:51,150
<b>Ga Hee. Could we have some water?</b>

453
00:27:51,319 --> 00:27:53,065
<b>Exercising made us thirsty.</b>

454
00:27:53,089 --> 00:27:54,250
<b>Of course.</b>

455
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:58,065
<b>Do you want me to serve you?</b>

456
00:27:58,089 --> 00:28:00,289
<b>- No, no. Move it.
- I'll get it.</b>

457
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:05,805
<b>Where's Joon Seon?
Didn't he go out with you?</b>

458
00:28:05,829 --> 00:28:08,069
<b>He's not in his right mind.</b>

459
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:11,146
<b>He's eating out with his family
after Seo Jin's interview.</b>

460
00:28:11,170 --> 00:28:14,585
<b>Oh, really? He must be so pleased.</b>

461
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:16,410
<b>It's been a while
since he ate with them.</b>

462
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,456
<b>Hey, which is better, this or this?</b>

463
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,549
<b>- White.
- Black.</b>

464
00:28:19,779 --> 00:28:21,585
<b>Neither of you are of any help.</b>

465
00:28:21,609 --> 00:28:22,656
<b>Ga Hee, which one?</b>

466
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,950
<b>They both look terrible.</b>

467
00:28:24,349 --> 00:28:26,166
<b>White went out of fashion,</b>

468
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:29,190
<b>and black will
make you look even scarier.</b>

469
00:28:30,059 --> 00:28:31,936
<b>Still, white should be better.</b>

470
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,505
<b>It's a nice interview look.</b>

471
00:28:33,529 --> 00:28:35,606
<b>Okay, then white it is.</b>

472
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:38,829
<b>What's the occasion that Hyun Gyung
suggested you eat together?</b>

473
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,906
<b>Is she giving you a green light?</b>

474
00:28:40,930 --> 00:28:44,216
<b>It's not like that.
Seo Young begged.</b>

475
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:47,186
<b>It's just one meal.
It means nothing.</b>

476
00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:50,210
<b>It doesn't mean anything.
Nothing at all.</b>

477
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,480
<b>Hang on.</b>

478
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:56,049
<b>Director Jo.
It has been a long time.</b>

479
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,180
<b>How have you been doing?</b>

480
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:00,866
<b>I need your help
with an urgent shoot.</b>

481
00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:03,059
<b>A shoot? Of course I'll do it.</b>

482
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:04,259
<b>When is it?</b>

483
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:06,119
<b>Today?</b>

484
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:08,589
<b>Today is not a good day.</b>

485
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:12,029
<b>He was in an accident?
That's too bad.</b>

486
00:29:12,329 --> 00:29:16,000
<b>No, it's just that I have some
personal affairs to take care of.</b>

487
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:18,616
<b>No, don't do that.</b>

488
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:21,269
<b>What time is the shoot?</b>

489
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,039
<b>I see.
Then we should be done before 3 p.m.</b>

490
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:27,985
<b>Then I'll do it. Thank you.</b>

491
00:29:28,009 --> 00:29:30,849
<b>Director Jo, we'll definitely
be done before 3 p.m., right?</b>

492
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:33,420
<b>Mom?</b>

493
00:29:34,089 --> 00:29:37,166
<b>Come over with Jae Seok later.
Let's have dinner together.</b>

494
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:38,795
<b>No, thanks. I'm fine.</b>

495
00:29:38,819 --> 00:29:40,265
<b>I'm not fine.</b>

496
00:29:40,289 --> 00:29:42,936
<b>If a divorced man loses weight,
people think you're upset.</b>

497
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,130
<b>It looks bad.</b>

498
00:29:44,259 --> 00:29:46,369
<b>I'm not like that.
I cook well for myself.</b>

499
00:29:47,369 --> 00:29:50,440
<b>Mom, I'm in an elevator.
I might get cut off. Bye.</b>

500
00:29:52,269 --> 00:29:54,339
<b>You need to know
I lose weight because of you.</b>

501
00:30:13,559 --> 00:30:14,630
<b>Good morning.</b>

502
00:30:15,529 --> 00:30:16,960
<b>Don't go too far.</b>

503
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:20,700
<b>We never greeted each other
like that even as classmates.</b>

504
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:25,240
<b>Did we not?
You sure have a good memory.</b>

505
00:30:26,869 --> 00:30:28,109
<b>Is it nice to be back home?</b>

506
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,950
<b>I'm trying hard to get used to it.</b>

507
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:35,626
<b>We all helped clean the house
on the weekend,</b>

508
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:37,319
<b>and even pickled radishes together.</b>

509
00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:42,265
<b>You did that?
Instead of sleeping in? No way.</b>

510
00:30:42,289 --> 00:30:43,809
<b>I couldn't believe it
even as I did it.</b>

511
00:30:45,019 --> 00:30:46,160
<b>What about you?</b>

512
00:30:47,259 --> 00:30:49,930
<b>Do you like having
the huge space all to yourself?</b>

513
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,400
<b>You bet I do.</b>

514
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:54,970
<b>It's great to watch soccer
when I want to.</b>

515
00:30:55,299 --> 00:30:57,500
<b>Gosh. I'm sure it is.</b>

516
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,299
<b>It is.</b>

517
00:31:01,509 --> 00:31:02,670
<b>I'm sure it is.</b>

518
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:05,410
<b>It is.</b>

519
00:31:09,650 --> 00:31:11,279
<b>It made no sense.</b>

520
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:15,366
<b>How are you?</b>

521
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:17,295
<b>- Good morning.
- You're here.</b>

522
00:31:17,319 --> 00:31:19,065
<b>Don't act like that.</b>

523
00:31:19,089 --> 00:31:20,636
<b>You make us feel worse.</b>

524
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:23,075
<b>Yes. We'll go back to
being good colleagues.</b>

525
00:31:23,099 --> 00:31:25,460
<b>Treat us as usual
without tiptoeing around us.</b>

526
00:31:25,799 --> 00:31:28,075
<b>Or we really can't
work together anymore.</b>

527
00:31:28,099 --> 00:31:29,630
<b>- Okay, then.
- Okay.</b>

528
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:34,440
<b>By the way,
the morning meeting was canceled.</b>

529
00:31:34,609 --> 00:31:37,916
<b>The director decided to take
a leave of absence.</b>

530
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:39,656
<b>- Really?
- Is he very sick?</b>

531
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,555
<b>It's his high BP and diabetes.</b>

532
00:31:41,579 --> 00:31:43,325
<b>He went on a sabbatical.</b>

533
00:31:43,349 --> 00:31:44,519
<b>You should give him a call.</b>

534
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:46,789
<b>I should do that.</b>

535
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:49,390
<b>Did we cause him too much stress?</b>

536
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:51,995
<b>Goodbye, then.</b>

537
00:31:52,019 --> 00:31:53,130
<b>See you.</b>

538
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:59,869
<b>He did lose control a bit.
He wouldn't stop drinking.</b>

539
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:04,369
<b>That is true, but...
Gosh, I feel so bad.</b>

540
00:32:05,339 --> 00:32:06,539
<b>I'll call him.</b>

541
00:32:06,809 --> 00:32:08,039
<b>Hey, Gyu Jin.</b>

542
00:32:09,009 --> 00:32:10,740
<b>Na Hee, I mean... Dr. Song.</b>

543
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:13,585
<b>Did you hear? Our director...</b>

544
00:32:13,609 --> 00:32:15,910
<b>- We heard.
- He took time off.</b>

545
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:17,619
<b>His blood pressure and diabetes...</b>

546
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,119
<b>We heard that too.</b>

547
00:32:20,019 --> 00:32:22,150
<b>- I'll go ahead. See you.
- Bye.</b>

548
00:32:23,759 --> 00:32:25,166
<b>What's going on?</b>

549
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:27,106
<b>You two get on better
now that everyone knows.</b>

550
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:28,305
<b>Is this the Hollywood way?</b>

551
00:32:28,329 --> 00:32:30,259
<b>Be quiet and get ready for work.</b>

552
00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:34,329
<b>Who will be the new director?</b>

553
00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:35,599
<b>Did you hear anything?</b>

554
00:32:35,930 --> 00:32:38,575
<b>I'm sure Director Jang
figured something out.</b>

555
00:32:38,599 --> 00:32:40,515
<b>They could be from Sejin Hospital
since they're our partners.</b>

556
00:32:40,539 --> 00:32:42,140
<b>That's where Director Jang was from.</b>

557
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:45,109
<b>Let's practice.</b>

558
00:32:45,809 --> 00:32:47,509
<b>Block and kick.</b>

559
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:49,686
<b>Two is easier.</b>

560
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:50,950
<b>You're ready.</b>

561
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:57,319
<b>When will we shoot this darn scene?</b>

562
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,936
<b>Director Jo, hang on.</b>

563
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:03,575
<b>Why... Why is there a delay?</b>

564
00:33:03,599 --> 00:33:05,706
<b>You said we'd be done by 3 p.m.</b>

565
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:08,900
<b>I can't stop the lead actor
from leaving to shoot a commercial.</b>

566
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:11,275
<b>I'm dying here trying to sort out
the locations we booked.</b>

567
00:33:11,299 --> 00:33:12,976
<b>- But still...
- I'm so sorry.</b>

568
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,545
<b>- I'm...
- Can we do 6 p.m. instead?</b>

569
00:33:14,569 --> 00:33:16,045
<b>The shoot got delayed.</b>

570
00:33:16,069 --> 00:33:18,309
<b>That punk just walked off
before I was done talking.</b>

571
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,150
<b>Do that again and I will crush you.</b>

572
00:33:23,619 --> 00:33:25,095
<b>I don't care. I did what I could.</b>

573
00:33:25,119 --> 00:33:26,990
<b>He can shoot without me.</b>

574
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:29,250
<b>Where is Young Chul's stunt double?</b>

575
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:31,720
<b>- Let's shoot. Get over here!
- I'm here!</b>

576
00:33:33,589 --> 00:33:35,460
<b>This is crazy. What should I do?</b>

577
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:37,235
<b>I'm coming!</b>

578
00:33:37,259 --> 00:33:39,529
<b>Song Seo Jin's parents.
We're ready for you.</b>

579
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,200
<b>Ma'am.</b>

580
00:33:47,569 --> 00:33:49,369
<b>Is Seo Jin's dad not here yet?</b>

581
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:50,740
<b>Not yet.</b>

582
00:33:51,579 --> 00:33:53,785
<b>I'm sorry.
Because of the program we run,</b>

583
00:33:53,809 --> 00:33:56,410
<b>we must see both parents.</b>

584
00:33:56,519 --> 00:33:58,549
<b>I should apologize.</b>

585
00:33:59,019 --> 00:34:01,390
<b>My husband isn't usually late.</b>

586
00:34:02,049 --> 00:34:04,019
<b>I guess something suddenly came up.</b>

587
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:05,565
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

588
00:34:05,589 --> 00:34:09,529
<b>Hyun Gyung! Hyun Gyung!
My goodness.</b>

589
00:34:10,930 --> 00:34:14,970
<b>Hello, Ma'am.
I am Song Seo Jin's father.</b>

590
00:34:15,730 --> 00:34:17,500
<b>- What?
- I ran over.</b>

591
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:19,739
<b>I'm sweating so much.</b>

592
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:23,115
<b>Please take good care of my Seo Jin.</b>

593
00:34:23,139 --> 00:34:24,440
<b>Sure...</b>

594
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:33,079
<b>Hyun Gyung, I'm sorry. Hyun Gyung.</b>

595
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:36,695
<b>They said we would be done by 2 p.m.</b>

596
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:39,635
<b>I thought I'd have time to
shower and change,</b>

597
00:34:39,659 --> 00:34:40,865
<b>so I took the job.</b>

598
00:34:40,889 --> 00:34:45,075
<b>The jerks in this industry
really never keep their word.</b>

599
00:34:45,099 --> 00:34:46,805
<b>They never keep promises.</b>

600
00:34:46,829 --> 00:34:50,139
<b>I was so angry with
the scumbags that I...</b>

601
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:55,940
<b>5 times. I reminded you 5 times.</b>

602
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:58,639
<b>"It's important. Don't be late.
You cannot be late."</b>

603
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:00,280
<b>What did you say each time?</b>

604
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:02,449
<b>You said, "Don't worry, trust me."</b>

605
00:35:03,579 --> 00:35:04,579
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

606
00:35:05,579 --> 00:35:06,889
<b>I trusted you.</b>

607
00:35:07,949 --> 00:35:11,019
<b>This time was about you as a dad,
not a husband.</b>

608
00:35:11,159 --> 00:35:13,329
<b>I didn't think you'd
let me down with this too.</b>

609
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:17,800
<b>But you really never change.</b>

610
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:19,699
<b>I'm sick of it.</b>

611
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:21,730
<b>I'm very sorry.</b>

612
00:35:22,570 --> 00:35:25,699
<b>I'm in the wrong.
I don't even dare make an excuse.</b>

613
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,940
<b>Apologize to Seo Young, not me.</b>

614
00:35:29,139 --> 00:35:31,610
<b>I don't think
I can sit across from you and eat.</b>

615
00:35:32,409 --> 00:35:33,510
<b>Dinner is off.</b>

616
00:35:50,859 --> 00:35:52,559
<b>(Episode 28)</b>

617
00:36:10,039 --> 00:36:11,956
<b>Gosh, does that mean I'm it?</b>

618
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:14,949
<b>I told you not to
give the ball to the nerd.</b>

619
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:19,890
<b>Darn it.</b>

620
00:36:22,159 --> 00:36:23,189
<b>You...</b>

621
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:25,530
<b>What? Why?</b>

622
00:36:41,009 --> 00:36:42,955
<b>- Here you go.
- Thank you.</b>

623
00:36:42,979 --> 00:36:44,555
<b>- I'm back.
- There you are.</b>

624
00:36:44,579 --> 00:36:46,149
<b>You have to go
right back out though.</b>

625
00:36:47,350 --> 00:36:49,119
<b>One is for the shoe shop and...</b>

626
00:36:49,479 --> 00:36:51,326
<b>The other is for Hyoseong Apartment
Building A, right?</b>

627
00:36:51,350 --> 00:36:52,390
<b>I'll get going.</b>

628
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:58,030
<b>He's not just handsome
but good at his job too.</b>

629
00:36:58,489 --> 00:37:01,230
<b>What would we have done without him?</b>

630
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,200
<b>Is Ok Boon still depressed?</b>

631
00:37:06,329 --> 00:37:09,299
<b>I guess. She stays in bed all day.</b>

632
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:12,346
<b>We have a big group
coming in tomorrow.</b>

633
00:37:12,370 --> 00:37:14,609
<b>Would we be able to handle it?</b>

634
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,079
<b>We'll manage, I guess.</b>

635
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:19,085
<b>You should grab some lunch instead
of working on an empty stomach.</b>

636
00:37:19,109 --> 00:37:21,650
<b>It's not just me though.
What about you?</b>

637
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:23,270
<b>I don't have much of an appetite.</b>

638
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:27,219
<b>Grab a bite to eat
before the dinner rush comes in.</b>

639
00:37:27,349 --> 00:37:28,495
<b>Sure thing.</b>

640
00:37:28,519 --> 00:37:31,260
<b>I'll get you something
on my way back.</b>

641
00:37:33,329 --> 00:37:35,159
<b>Gosh, I'm aching all over.</b>

642
00:37:35,799 --> 00:37:38,706
<b>Why must I suffer like this
whenever my nieces and nephew...</b>

643
00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:40,500
<b>cause trouble?</b>

644
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,176
<b>Bye!</b>

645
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,700
<b>- Bye, kids.
- Bye.</b>

646
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:45,415
<b>- Get home safely.
- Bye.</b>

647
00:37:45,439 --> 00:37:46,510
<b>See you!</b>

648
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:57,526
<b>We're out of eggs and spinach.
I should get some groceries.</b>

649
00:37:57,550 --> 00:37:59,325
<b>What, already?</b>

650
00:37:59,349 --> 00:38:01,996
<b>This is because you're
too generous with the ingredients.</b>

651
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:04,665
<b>Customers won't come back
if it seems like...</b>

652
00:38:04,689 --> 00:38:06,460
<b>we're ripping them off.</b>

653
00:38:06,490 --> 00:38:09,460
<b>I rolled all the kimbap,
so just slice and serve them.</b>

654
00:38:09,759 --> 00:38:11,400
<b>- Sure.
- I'll get going.</b>

655
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:14,939
<b>Can I get some kimbap?</b>

656
00:38:15,199 --> 00:38:18,639
<b>Yes, of course.
Have a seat, Ms. Jang.</b>

657
00:38:18,939 --> 00:38:20,370
<b>It's good to see you.</b>

658
00:38:20,509 --> 00:38:21,639
<b>Welcome.</b>

659
00:38:22,379 --> 00:38:23,740
<b>What's with that expression?</b>

660
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:26,156
<b>You're saying you're glad to see me,</b>

661
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:28,150
<b>but you all look annoyed.</b>

662
00:38:28,419 --> 00:38:30,419
<b>Of course not. Please have a seat.</b>

663
00:38:34,389 --> 00:38:36,590
<b>Enjoy your kimbap then.</b>

664
00:38:40,129 --> 00:38:43,205
<b>It seems like the merchants
come around here often.</b>

665
00:38:43,229 --> 00:38:45,400
<b>Who's your most frequent customer
these days?</b>

666
00:38:45,629 --> 00:38:49,276
<b>The owner dried fish store
or Mr. Yang from the butcher shop?</b>

667
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:52,645
<b>These days,
it has to be Mr. Yang, right?</b>

668
00:38:52,669 --> 00:38:55,340
<b>Right. He's here almost every day.</b>

669
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,379
<b>Is that so?</b>

670
00:38:59,610 --> 00:39:03,226
<b>It's you, isn't it?
You're the one flirting with him.</b>

671
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:04,425
<b>Is it you then?</b>

672
00:39:04,449 --> 00:39:08,020
<b>Does Mr. Yang come here to see you?
Does he?</b>

673
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:12,129
<b>- Please enjoy.
- Please enjoy.</b>

674
00:39:24,569 --> 00:39:26,539
<b>I dare you to come, Yang Chi Su.</b>

675
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:30,610
<b>I'll block your view
so you don't see either of them.</b>

676
00:39:35,719 --> 00:39:38,889
<b>I don't know why,
but she keeps getting on my nerves.</b>

677
00:39:40,819 --> 00:39:42,689
<b>Cho Yeon, my goodness.</b>

678
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:46,265
<b>- Are you heading somewhere?
- Yes, I'm off to buy groceries.</b>

679
00:39:46,289 --> 00:39:47,365
<b>Is that so?</b>

680
00:39:47,389 --> 00:39:49,836
<b>That's great. I was on my way
to buy groceries too.</b>

681
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:52,376
<b>- We can go together.
- Didn't you want some kimbap?</b>

682
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,669
<b>No, I was just walking by.</b>

683
00:39:55,439 --> 00:39:56,559
<b>Anyway, please lead the way.</b>

684
00:40:02,139 --> 00:40:03,755
<b>You didn't have
to carry this for me.</b>

685
00:40:03,779 --> 00:40:05,855
<b>It must be heavy
with all the radishes.</b>

686
00:40:05,879 --> 00:40:09,255
<b>Don't sweat it.
I have nothing but strength anyway.</b>

687
00:40:09,279 --> 00:40:12,389
<b>If you're grateful,
you can buy me sundaeguk sometime.</b>

688
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:14,019
<b>Why not?</b>

689
00:40:14,189 --> 00:40:16,596
<b>I'd like to thank you
for all the free meat anyway.</b>

690
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:20,089
<b>Really? Then I'll have two bowls.</b>

691
00:40:20,759 --> 00:40:22,276
<b>Goodness.</b>

692
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:23,476
<b>It's heavy, isn't it? Here. Let me.</b>

693
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:26,545
<b>It's not heavy at all.
I was just working out...</b>

694
00:40:26,569 --> 00:40:28,699
<b>both of my arms, you see.</b>

695
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,470
<b>I like to sneak in
short workouts here and there.</b>

696
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:37,610
<b>- Gosh.
- Forget it. Let me carry that.</b>

697
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:41,720
<b>No, it's fine.
I don't want you to hurt yourself.</b>

698
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:48,435
<b>My gosh. Cho Yeon, wait for me!</b>

699
00:40:48,459 --> 00:40:49,959
<b>Wait up.</b>

700
00:40:58,569 --> 00:41:00,600
<b>I see he's not coming by today.</b>

701
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:04,540
<b>He won't be able to get any ideas
with me sitting here.</b>

702
00:41:06,009 --> 00:41:07,610
<b>Get cheeky all you want.</b>

703
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:11,610
<b>Nothing you do will get by me.</b>

704
00:41:16,350 --> 00:41:19,596
<b>Today is my lucky day!</b>

705
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:21,589
<b>Wait, it's from Mom.</b>

706
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:25,889
<b>Seo Young, dinner is off.
Come straight home.</b>

707
00:41:26,889 --> 00:41:27,990
<b>Seo Young!</b>

708
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:34,839
<b>Hi, Dad.</b>

709
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:37,769
<b>My gosh.</b>

710
00:41:41,410 --> 00:41:44,286
<b>I offered to buy you steak,
but this is what you choose?</b>

711
00:41:44,310 --> 00:41:45,850
<b>I have money, you know.</b>

712
00:41:46,310 --> 00:41:48,055
<b>I know.
I just wanted to eat tteokbokki.</b>

713
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:49,656
<b>I've been craving this all day.</b>

714
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:52,266
<b>Is that so? Then eat up.
Have some more after that.</b>

715
00:41:52,290 --> 00:41:53,350
<b>I will.</b>

716
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:58,160
<b>Seo Young,</b>

717
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:00,430
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

718
00:42:00,529 --> 00:42:02,136
<b>I know how much
you looked forward to this dinner,</b>

719
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,505
<b>but I blew it.</b>

720
00:42:03,529 --> 00:42:06,399
<b>It's fine, Dad.
You've already apologized enough.</b>

721
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:09,170
<b>It gets old at some point.</b>

722
00:42:09,699 --> 00:42:10,740
<b>Is that so?</b>

723
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:18,480
<b>Seo Young, have you ever hated me?</b>

724
00:42:18,649 --> 00:42:20,250
<b>No. Why do you ask?</b>

725
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:24,425
<b>It's true that
I'm not like other dads.</b>

726
00:42:24,449 --> 00:42:27,389
<b>I don't have an ordinary job
and I don't get along with your mom.</b>

727
00:42:27,790 --> 00:42:30,665
<b>It's why I can't be
in your life more.</b>

728
00:42:30,689 --> 00:42:31,829
<b>I don't mind it.</b>

729
00:42:32,259 --> 00:42:34,976
<b>Since you live apart,
I get pocket money from both of you.</b>

730
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,100
<b>Also, I have a place to hide
when Mom starts nagging me.</b>

731
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:41,569
<b>I can choose to be wherever I want.</b>

732
00:42:41,870 --> 00:42:43,476
<b>The other kids don't know
how fun that can be.</b>

733
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:45,485
<b>I know you're lying.</b>

734
00:42:45,509 --> 00:42:48,016
<b>You want us to be
like a normal family...</b>

735
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:51,185
<b>and wish for me to work
at an office like other dads.</b>

736
00:42:51,209 --> 00:42:52,355
<b>I know you've thought of that.</b>

737
00:42:52,379 --> 00:42:55,355
<b>That's not true at all.
You're a CEO...</b>

738
00:42:55,379 --> 00:42:57,620
<b>while the others are employees.
You're way better.</b>

739
00:42:57,750 --> 00:42:59,990
<b>I'd rather die
as the daughter of a CEO.</b>

740
00:43:00,189 --> 00:43:02,420
<b>Besides, your business
will take off soon, right?</b>

741
00:43:02,589 --> 00:43:04,165
<b>I'll have to ride it out.</b>

742
00:43:04,189 --> 00:43:05,189
<b>Ride it out?</b>

743
00:43:05,730 --> 00:43:08,860
<b>Yes, I'll hang on
until you finally make it.</b>

744
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:11,600
<b>Hold on.</b>

745
00:43:11,829 --> 00:43:13,399
<b>I want a corn dog.</b>

746
00:43:13,769 --> 00:43:14,746
<b>Can I order one?</b>

747
00:43:14,770 --> 00:43:17,076
<b>Of course.
Anything for a CEO's daughter!</b>

748
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:18,175
<b>Have 10 if you want.</b>

749
00:43:18,199 --> 00:43:20,045
<b>Can we get 10 corn dogs?</b>

750
00:43:20,069 --> 00:43:21,656
<b>- Sure thing.
- 10 corn dogs?</b>

751
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:22,810
<b>Nice!</b>

752
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:31,750
<b>Gosh, it's good.</b>

753
00:43:59,250 --> 00:44:00,410
<b>Hi.</b>

754
00:44:23,370 --> 00:44:24,700
<b>It's "buy 1, get 1 free".</b>

755
00:44:39,649 --> 00:44:40,789
<b>What grade are you in?</b>

756
00:44:41,590 --> 00:44:42,590
<b>Fourth?</b>

757
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:45,460
<b>Fifth.</b>

758
00:44:46,190 --> 00:44:47,289
<b>Fifth?</b>

759
00:44:48,090 --> 00:44:49,960
<b>You're small for a fifth-grader.</b>

760
00:44:52,029 --> 00:44:54,570
<b>How are things at school? Is it fun?</b>

761
00:44:56,299 --> 00:44:58,070
<b>Yes, it is.</b>

762
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:01,470
<b>Is that so?</b>

763
00:45:05,210 --> 00:45:07,009
<b>Let's get together often
at this place.</b>

764
00:45:08,309 --> 00:45:11,080
<b>They have "buy 1, get 1 free" deals
quite often.</b>

765
00:45:13,019 --> 00:45:14,049
<b>Sure thing.</b>

766
00:45:46,190 --> 00:45:47,690
<b>You're home.</b>

767
00:45:47,889 --> 00:45:49,566
<b>It's late. Do you want dinner?</b>

768
00:45:49,590 --> 00:45:50,990
<b>I grabbed some with Dad.</b>

769
00:45:52,929 --> 00:45:54,505
<b>Don't get mad at me, okay?</b>

770
00:45:54,529 --> 00:45:56,105
<b>I wanted to keep our promise,</b>

771
00:45:56,129 --> 00:45:57,235
<b>- but your dad...
- I know.</b>

772
00:45:57,259 --> 00:45:59,970
<b>Dad told me everything.
I know it's his fault.</b>

773
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:02,899
<b>But Mom,</b>

774
00:46:03,639 --> 00:46:05,639
<b>what is it that you always tell me?</b>

775
00:46:06,470 --> 00:46:09,210
<b>I don't have to be the best
as long as I try my best.</b>

776
00:46:09,610 --> 00:46:10,940
<b>You said that's enough.</b>

777
00:46:13,379 --> 00:46:15,755
<b>Dad may not be the best
but he's trying.</b>

778
00:46:15,779 --> 00:46:17,250
<b>He's trying very hard.</b>

779
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:20,320
<b>It's clear to me,</b>

780
00:46:21,519 --> 00:46:23,289
<b>so why isn't it to you?</b>

781
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:24,889
<b>Seo Young...</b>

782
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:27,590
<b>They're corn dogs.
Dad bought it for you and Seo Jin.</b>

783
00:46:43,309 --> 00:46:44,539
<b>Thank you for the meal.</b>

784
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:46,755
<b>What's wrong? Are you done already?</b>

785
00:46:46,779 --> 00:46:49,179
<b>Yes, I just don't have
much of an appetite today.</b>

786
00:46:49,649 --> 00:46:50,980
<b>Take your time with your meals.</b>

787
00:46:55,460 --> 00:46:56,919
<b>What's up with him today?</b>

788
00:46:57,419 --> 00:46:59,235
<b>Food is what he lives for,</b>

789
00:46:59,259 --> 00:47:01,360
<b>so why on earth
doesn't he have an appetite?</b>

790
00:47:02,129 --> 00:47:03,730
<b>Did something happen?</b>

791
00:47:05,470 --> 00:47:07,405
<b>- Well...
- You see...</b>

792
00:47:07,429 --> 00:47:09,275
<b>He was excited
about a family dinner,</b>

793
00:47:09,299 --> 00:47:10,539
<b>but I guess it didn't happen.</b>

794
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:11,940
<b>He was late.</b>

795
00:47:12,769 --> 00:47:14,509
<b>He was late for an appointment?</b>

796
00:47:14,669 --> 00:47:16,309
<b>Who? Joon Seon?</b>

797
00:47:16,639 --> 00:47:19,785
<b>Yes, he was asked to fill in
for another stuntman.</b>

798
00:47:19,809 --> 00:47:22,519
<b>The director promised
to finish on time at first.</b>

799
00:47:24,149 --> 00:47:25,926
<b>What a pathetic idiot.</b>

800
00:47:25,950 --> 00:47:28,025
<b>It'll be faster to wish for
a flower to grow in the desert...</b>

801
00:47:28,049 --> 00:47:29,590
<b>than expect anything from him.</b>

802
00:47:31,659 --> 00:47:34,129
<b>Mom, let me do that.
I have some time today.</b>

803
00:47:37,929 --> 00:47:40,299
<b>Until when will you be like this?</b>

804
00:47:41,629 --> 00:47:42,870
<b>What do you mean?</b>

805
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:45,000
<b>Don't play dumb with me.</b>

806
00:47:45,370 --> 00:47:49,086
<b>I mean with Na Hee.
Until when will you ignore her?</b>

807
00:47:49,110 --> 00:47:52,255
<b>You're the one who told me
to vent my anger.</b>

808
00:47:52,279 --> 00:47:54,279
<b>I'm just baffled, you know.</b>

809
00:47:54,679 --> 00:47:55,726
<b>You were cooking and everything,</b>

810
00:47:55,750 --> 00:47:58,279
<b>so I thought
you were feeling better.</b>

811
00:47:58,789 --> 00:48:01,995
<b>The eggplants and the other
side dishes were all her favorite.</b>

812
00:48:02,019 --> 00:48:04,289
<b>Don't be absurd.
I'd be crazy to cook all that...</b>

813
00:48:04,419 --> 00:48:07,265
<b>for a daughter
who stabbed me in the back.</b>

814
00:48:07,289 --> 00:48:09,875
<b>Okay, fine.
There's no need to get riled up.</b>

815
00:48:09,899 --> 00:48:11,529
<b>Whatever you say.</b>

816
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:19,269
<b>Are you coming to work?</b>

817
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:22,115
<b>Why not take at least
another day off?</b>

818
00:48:22,139 --> 00:48:23,385
<b>Forget about it.</b>

819
00:48:23,409 --> 00:48:25,679
<b>It's not like I can rest forever.</b>

820
00:48:26,309 --> 00:48:28,409
<b>We have a big order coming in today.</b>

821
00:48:28,779 --> 00:48:31,679
<b>I can't just leave you and Ok Ja
to handle it all.</b>

822
00:48:31,779 --> 00:48:33,049
<b>Are you sure though?</b>

823
00:48:33,389 --> 00:48:36,820
<b>The people at the market
are still gossiping about this.</b>

824
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:40,230
<b>I'll have to face them
sooner or later.</b>

825
00:48:41,389 --> 00:48:43,330
<b>I can't hide at home
because of them.</b>

826
00:48:44,830 --> 00:48:46,830
<b>I really need you to do this for me.</b>

827
00:48:47,529 --> 00:48:49,946
<b>My sister is on her way here and...</b>

828
00:48:49,970 --> 00:48:51,076
<b>Really?</b>

829
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:53,186
<b>She's already coming back to work?</b>

830
00:48:53,210 --> 00:48:55,755
<b>Really? What about her daughter?</b>

831
00:48:55,779 --> 00:48:57,515
<b>Is she really divorced?</b>

832
00:48:57,539 --> 00:49:00,409
<b>See what I mean?
Just keep quiet for crying out loud!</b>

833
00:49:02,049 --> 00:49:04,419
<b>This is why I took the time
to speak to you.</b>

834
00:49:05,490 --> 00:49:08,450
<b>I know that you're not fond
of my sister...</b>

835
00:49:08,690 --> 00:49:12,159
<b>and that you want to know
what's going on.</b>

836
00:49:13,059 --> 00:49:16,076
<b>But she just made it back
from the devil's mouth,</b>

837
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:18,535
<b>so please don't say
anything to her today.</b>

838
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:20,769
<b>Don't even mention
the letter D of divorce.</b>

839
00:49:21,129 --> 00:49:22,716
<b>Please. I'm begging you.</b>

840
00:49:22,740 --> 00:49:27,145
<b>What do you mean
we're not fond of your sister?</b>

841
00:49:27,169 --> 00:49:30,009
<b>Exactly. We're not that tactless.</b>

842
00:49:30,279 --> 00:49:32,480
<b>We'd never ask about it to her face.</b>

843
00:49:32,779 --> 00:49:34,750
<b>But it's how you've always been.</b>

844
00:49:35,350 --> 00:49:36,480
<b>Well,</b>

845
00:49:36,980 --> 00:49:39,750
<b>I guess we've been that way, but...</b>

846
00:49:40,350 --> 00:49:42,789
<b>Don't worry though.
We'll keep our mouths shut.</b>

847
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:44,789
<b>Please do, okay?</b>

848
00:49:44,889 --> 00:49:47,490
<b>Topics like divorces or annulments
are strictly prohibited...</b>

849
00:49:47,529 --> 00:49:50,176
<b>and words like the end, over,
done, or split...</b>

850
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:52,046
<b>should never be mentioned.</b>

851
00:49:52,070 --> 00:49:54,576
<b>You are not to say anything negative
that can provoke her.</b>

852
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:56,639
<b>We hear you, goodness.</b>

853
00:49:57,970 --> 00:49:59,409
<b>So tell me.</b>

854
00:50:00,210 --> 00:50:03,916
<b>What do I do if the words come
flying out of my mouth as usual?</b>

855
00:50:03,940 --> 00:50:06,956
<b>Let's each promise to
clamp our lips shut like this.</b>

856
00:50:06,980 --> 00:50:08,850
<b>- Like this?
- Yes.</b>

857
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:10,796
<b>How's that?</b>

858
00:50:10,820 --> 00:50:12,850
<b>Yes, I'd appreciate at least that.</b>

859
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:16,559
<b>Ok Boon!</b>

860
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:19,230
<b>Do well, okay?
I'm trusting you guys.</b>

861
00:50:19,629 --> 00:50:21,190
<b>- Hello, Mr. Song.
- Hi.</b>

862
00:50:22,159 --> 00:50:23,360
<b>Let me.</b>

863
00:50:24,429 --> 00:50:25,476
<b>I'll take that.</b>

864
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:28,899
<b>Ok Boon, it's been so long.</b>

865
00:50:29,139 --> 00:50:31,015
<b>I was close to forgetting your face.</b>

866
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:32,485
<b>Have you all been well?</b>

867
00:50:32,509 --> 00:50:33,769
<b>Of course!</b>

868
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:36,216
<b>Maybe it's because
you got a good rest,</b>

869
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:38,509
<b>but you look better than ever.</b>

870
00:50:38,710 --> 00:50:42,120
<b>I thought you'd look gaunt
from all the heartache...</b>

871
00:50:43,820 --> 00:50:45,726
<b>Since you weren't around,</b>

872
00:50:45,750 --> 00:50:47,919
<b>we weren't able
to go to our dance classes properly.</b>

873
00:50:48,190 --> 00:50:52,635
<b>The dance instructor asked
why you haven't been around...</b>

874
00:50:52,659 --> 00:50:54,330
<b>and if there was trouble at home...</b>

875
00:50:59,299 --> 00:51:02,275
<b>Forget about it
and be yourselves, okay?</b>

876
00:51:02,299 --> 00:51:03,840
<b>I'm fine.</b>

877
00:51:05,870 --> 00:51:07,139
<b>Really?</b>

878
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:09,056
<b>Are you sure you're okay?</b>

879
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:10,610
<b>Yes, I'm good.</b>

880
00:51:10,779 --> 00:51:12,739
<b>Your kids never turn out
the way you want them to.</b>

881
00:51:12,850 --> 00:51:14,330
<b>I'm done expecting
anything from them.</b>

882
00:51:15,049 --> 00:51:17,649
<b>My gosh. Ms. Jang, you're back!</b>

883
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:21,196
<b>You have no idea
how worried I've been.</b>

884
00:51:21,220 --> 00:51:24,096
<b>- Me too.
- It's good to have you back.</b>

885
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:26,105
<b>Right. Thank you.</b>

886
00:51:26,129 --> 00:51:29,076
<b>The market is never the same

887
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:32,269
<b>It felt empty without you around.</b>

888
00:51:33,370 --> 00:51:36,899
<b>Your skin looks better than it did

<b>My goodness.</b>

890
00:51:39,169 --> 00:51:40,686
<b>Not enough money...</b>

891
00:51:40,710 --> 00:51:42,779
<b>can buy you the skin
that some people are born with.</b>

892
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:46,610
<b>Do you take care of it at home?</b>

893
00:51:46,710 --> 00:51:48,186
<b>Do you apply a homemade face mask?</b>

894
00:51:48,210 --> 00:51:50,426
<b>No, of course not.</b>

895
00:51:50,450 --> 00:51:53,226

- Love you, Ms. Jang.</b>

907
00:52:15,210 --> 00:52:17,179
<b>- Beautiful Ms. Jang.
- Beautiful Ms. Jang.</b>

908
00:52:21,450 --> 00:52:24,255
<b>Things have been so uncomfortable
because of Mom.</b>

909
00:52:24,279 --> 00:52:26,549
<b>Until when will she give
Na Hee the cold shoulder?</b>

910
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:28,049
<b>It's been hard, you know.</b>

911
00:52:28,149 --> 00:52:29,519
<b>Tell me about it.</b>

912
00:52:30,019 --> 00:52:31,889
<b>Na Hee must be embarrassed.</b>

913
00:52:32,019 --> 00:52:33,865
<b>Mom won't even respond to her.</b>

914
00:52:33,889 --> 00:52:35,159
<b>I know.</b>

915
00:52:35,230 --> 00:52:36,830
<b>This must be killing her pride.</b>

916
00:52:37,830 --> 00:52:41,370
<b>Still, she's been trying hard
to make up for what she did wrong.</b>

917
00:52:43,139 --> 00:52:45,639
<b>Should we help them make amends?</b>

918
00:52:46,169 --> 00:52:47,240
<b>How?</b>

919
00:52:48,169 --> 00:52:49,940
<b>We'll keep pushing them together.</b>

920
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:52,009
<b>A meal and a movie...</b>

921
00:52:52,150 --> 00:52:54,309
<b>might get them
to start talking again.</b>

922
00:52:55,150 --> 00:52:58,079
<b>Mom is not being this way
because she really hates Na Hee.</b>

923
00:52:58,480 --> 00:52:59,890
<b>I'm not sure.</b>

924
00:53:00,319 --> 00:53:02,366
<b>Shouldn't we give them
a little more time?</b>

925
00:53:02,390 --> 00:53:05,460
<b>What they need is good timing,
not time itself.</b>

926
00:53:06,130 --> 00:53:07,329
<b>Trust me, okay?</b>

927
00:53:08,759 --> 00:53:10,130
<b>A surprise?</b>

928
00:53:11,359 --> 00:53:14,130
<b>I doubt Mom would like that.</b>

929
00:53:15,430 --> 00:53:17,500
<b>Of course, it has been
uncomfortable for me too.</b>

930
00:53:17,569 --> 00:53:20,509
<b>So you want us to
ambush her at the shop?</b>

931
00:53:21,769 --> 00:53:23,980
<b>I mean sure, I can pay for the meal.</b>

932
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:25,910
<b>All right then.</b>

933
00:53:26,710 --> 00:53:28,779
<b>It will be around six
if I get off work on time.</b>

934
00:53:29,380 --> 00:53:31,579
<b>Okay. I'll see you later.</b>

935
00:53:40,029 --> 00:53:41,029
<b>Hey.</b>

936
00:53:41,829 --> 00:53:42,859
<b>Aren't you coming?</b>

937
00:53:44,130 --> 00:53:45,869
<b>- Where?
- To the meeting room.</b>

938
00:53:46,529 --> 00:53:48,829
<b>The HR team called us in.</b>

939
00:53:49,140 --> 00:53:50,275
<b>Did you not check the group message?</b>

940
00:53:50,299 --> 00:53:51,339
<b>A group message?</b>

941
00:53:52,609 --> 00:53:53,910
<b>Is there a group chatroom?</b>

942
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:57,480
<b>Gi Yeong is in charge of it.
Did he forget to invite you?</b>

943
00:53:59,079 --> 00:54:01,626
<b>So you should've
been nicer to the guys.</b>

944
00:54:01,650 --> 00:54:02,980
<b>Do you want me to invite you?</b>

945
00:54:03,619 --> 00:54:06,720
<b>No, it's okay.
So is it in the meeting room?</b>

946
00:54:07,650 --> 00:54:09,220
<b>I'm going to kill Gi Yeong.</b>

947
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:18,059
<b>Gosh, what should I do with her?</b>

948
00:54:18,359 --> 00:54:20,476
<b>All right? We should go.</b>

949
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:21,876
<b>Hello.</b>

950
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:22,900
<b>What?</b>

951
00:54:23,539 --> 00:54:25,345
<b>You two are coming in together.</b>

952
00:54:25,369 --> 00:54:28,339
<b>How awkward it is.
Don't you think so?</b>

953
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:39,519
<b>Why did the HR team call us in
so suddenly?</b>

954
00:54:39,589 --> 00:54:41,495
<b>I'm not sure, but Ji Yeon says...</b>

955
00:54:41,519 --> 00:54:44,059
<b>there will be
an interim hospital director.</b>

956
00:54:44,190 --> 00:54:46,765
<b>An interim director? Already?</b>

957
00:54:46,789 --> 00:54:48,059
<b>You can't say that.</b>

958
00:54:48,089 --> 00:54:50,169
<b>It's not a position
that can be left vacant for long.</b>

959
00:54:50,529 --> 00:54:52,275
<b>Who could it be?</b>

960
00:54:52,299 --> 00:54:55,470
<b>I hope it's someone who speaks
the same language as us.</b>

961
00:54:55,529 --> 00:54:56,640
<b>Hey, you...</b>

962
00:54:56,740 --> 00:54:58,339
<b>You all are here.</b>

963
00:54:58,869 --> 00:55:02,710
<b>As you know, the hospital director
is on sick leave for now.</b>

964
00:55:03,140 --> 00:55:06,509
<b>So we've found an interim director
to take charge of our hospital.</b>

965
00:55:06,779 --> 00:55:07,950
<b>Please come on in.</b>

966
00:55:14,019 --> 00:55:15,589
<b>What?</b>

967
00:55:17,390 --> 00:55:18,460
<b>Hello.</b>

968
00:55:18,990 --> 00:55:21,529
<b>I'm Lee Jeong Rok who will act
as the interim hospital director.</b>

969
00:55:22,829 --> 00:55:25,329
<b>Fortunately, I see a few
familiar faces.</b>

970
00:55:33,109 --> 00:55:34,240
<b>What happened?</b>

971
00:55:35,809 --> 00:55:37,309
<b>It just happened this way.</b>

972
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:40,150
<b>Director Jang asked me
quite earnestly.</b>

973
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:42,720
<b>And he's friends with my boss.</b>

974
00:55:42,750 --> 00:55:46,019
<b>I'm just like a dispatched soldier.</b>

975
00:55:46,490 --> 00:55:48,519
<b>I'm honored to work with you.</b>

976
00:55:49,319 --> 00:55:52,390
<b>Everyone is excited
to work with a young director.</b>

977
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:56,876
<b>Gyu Jin,
I will appreciate your help.</b>

978
00:55:56,900 --> 00:55:58,740
<b>The junior doctors here
seem to like you a lot.</b>

979
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,670
<b>Yes, of course.</b>

980
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:03,470
<b>Hello.</b>

981
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:06,069
<b>Gosh, this is unbelievable.</b>

982
00:56:06,170 --> 00:56:09,440
<b>I know he's an interim director,
but he's so young.</b>

983
00:56:10,940 --> 00:56:13,686
<b>Director Jang cares for him a lot.</b>

984
00:56:13,710 --> 00:56:16,070
<b>Director Jang has had his eye on him
since he was in school.</b>

985
00:56:17,750 --> 00:56:21,995
<b>By the way, the new director seems
exceptionally close with Na Hee.</b>

986
00:56:22,019 --> 00:56:24,059
<b>I felt that way during
that joint surgical case too.</b>

987
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:25,890
<b>Are they close friends?</b>

988
00:56:26,029 --> 00:56:28,329
<b>I don't know. How would I know that?</b>

989
00:56:29,930 --> 00:56:30,930
<b>Hang on.</b>

990
00:56:31,660 --> 00:56:33,200
<b>(Mother)</b>

991
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:37,740
<b>Let's go.</b>

992
00:56:37,869 --> 00:56:39,039
<b>Wait.</b>

993
00:56:41,339 --> 00:56:42,380
<b>Hello?</b>

994
00:56:42,710 --> 00:56:44,980
<b>Yes. He's right next to me.</b>

995
00:56:45,609 --> 00:56:48,450
<b>Okay. Have a nice day. Bye.</b>

996
00:56:49,750 --> 00:56:51,356
<b>What? Who was that?</b>

997
00:56:51,380 --> 00:56:53,619
<b>Mom. She told me
to bring you home after work.</b>

998
00:56:53,650 --> 00:56:56,390
<b>- We'll have dinner.
- She's so tenacious.</b>

999
00:56:57,059 --> 00:57:00,765
<b>Hey, why did you say yes to that?</b>

1000
00:57:00,789 --> 00:57:03,106
<b>If I don't bring you with me,
she won't let me sleep at night.</b>

1001
00:57:03,130 --> 00:57:04,476
<b>I live with her, you know.</b>

1002
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:06,005
<b>I don't know.
Just tell her that you missed me.</b>

1003
00:57:06,029 --> 00:57:08,799
<b>Tell her that I was already gone
when you came by my office.</b>

1004
00:57:09,740 --> 00:57:12,686
<b>If you don't come,
she'll bring the food to your place.</b>

1005
00:57:12,710 --> 00:57:13,839
<b>That's what Mom said.</b>

1006
00:57:23,019 --> 00:57:24,255
<b>Na Hee.</b>

1007
00:57:24,279 --> 00:57:26,720
<b>What took you so long?
We were waiting forever.</b>

1008
00:57:27,119 --> 00:57:28,595
<b>The bus came late.</b>

1009
00:57:28,619 --> 00:57:30,295
<b>You should've waited in a cafe.</b>

1010
00:57:30,319 --> 00:57:32,690
<b>Forget it.
I have no money to spend on coffee.</b>

1011
00:57:34,829 --> 00:57:38,299
<b>It looks like we'll be having
a girls' night, thanks to you.</b>

1012
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:40,430
<b>Thank you. It's so touching.</b>

1013
00:57:40,670 --> 00:57:42,005
<b>Don't be sarcastic.</b>

1014
00:57:42,029 --> 00:57:44,569
<b>I'm in no mood for your jokes now.</b>

1015
00:57:45,140 --> 00:57:46,170
<b>Sorry.</b>

1016
00:57:46,910 --> 00:57:49,339
<b>Let's just go to Mom.</b>

1017
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:51,839
<b>Let's go, Na Hee.</b>

1018
00:57:53,849 --> 00:57:55,686
<b>Here. Can you carry them all?</b>

1019
00:57:55,710 --> 00:57:57,779
<b>Yes. These will fit perfectly.</b>

1020
00:57:58,480 --> 00:57:59,525
<b>I'll be right back.</b>

1021
00:57:59,549 --> 00:58:02,196
<b>Okay. Drive safe.</b>

1022
00:58:02,220 --> 00:58:04,289
<b>- Don't drive too fast.
- Okay.</b>

1023
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:07,906
<b>- Gosh.
- What's wrong? Is it your back?</b>

1024
00:58:07,930 --> 00:58:08,907
<b>Do you want me to massage it?</b>

1025
00:58:08,931 --> 00:58:11,029
<b>It's okay. Don't make a fuss.</b>

1026
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:15,005
<b>I thought we wouldn't be able
to deliver it on time,</b>

1027
00:58:15,029 --> 00:58:17,176
<b>but we barely made it
thanks to Ok Boon, right?</b>

1028
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:19,470
<b>Sure. That was so close.</b>

1029
00:58:20,269 --> 00:58:23,916
<b>We definitely need her in the store
at all times.</b>

1030
00:58:23,940 --> 00:58:27,755
<b>See? Things are totally different
when she is here and when she isn't.</b>

1031
00:58:27,779 --> 00:58:29,495
<b>The place is full of energy.</b>

1032
00:58:29,519 --> 00:58:32,226
<b>Goodness, that's enough. I get it.</b>

1033
00:58:32,250 --> 00:58:35,220
<b>You've been chattering all day.
Your lips must hurt.</b>

1034
00:58:35,819 --> 00:58:38,366
<b>I know. I just can't stop talking...</b>

1035
00:58:38,390 --> 00:58:40,589
<b>when you're around.</b>

1036
00:58:40,890 --> 00:58:44,035
<b>All right then. Let's clean up.</b>

1037
00:58:44,059 --> 00:58:45,805
<b>You take care of the kitchen.
I will clean the stand.</b>

1038
00:58:45,829 --> 00:58:47,745
<b>You don't have to clean.</b>

1039
00:58:47,769 --> 00:58:49,545
<b>You should go home and rest.</b>

1040
00:58:49,569 --> 00:58:50,569
<b>Only me?</b>

1041
00:58:51,299 --> 00:58:53,515
<b>It's okay.
Let's finish and go home together.</b>

1042
00:58:53,539 --> 00:58:54,716
<b>This is your first day back.</b>

1043
00:58:54,740 --> 00:58:57,809
<b>You didn't even have time to eat.
You might come down with something.</b>

1044
00:58:58,180 --> 00:59:00,726
<b>Just go home.
We will take care of the rest.</b>

1045
00:59:00,750 --> 00:59:04,595
<b>Gosh, Young Dal.
You sound so caring.</b>

1046
00:59:04,619 --> 00:59:06,450
<b>I worked all day too.</b>

1047
00:59:06,650 --> 00:59:09,619
<b>I just don't want her
to resent me later.</b>

1048
00:59:10,819 --> 00:59:12,930
<b>Just go home
before I change my mind.</b>

1049
00:59:14,029 --> 00:59:16,859
<b>Okay. I'm going home then.</b>

1050
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:22,740
<b>I can't believe
I'm leaving work early.</b>

1051
00:59:23,299 --> 00:59:25,269
<b>I guess it's worth falling ill
every now and then.</b>

1052
00:59:25,740 --> 00:59:26,769
<b>Gosh.</b>

1053
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:56,200
<b>Are you coming from the market?</b>

1054
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:58,240
<b>Yes.</b>

1055
00:59:59,309 --> 01:00:02,140
<b>I guess you're doing well enough
to work at your store.</b>

1056
01:00:02,740 --> 01:00:05,809
<b>I'm too upset to work,
so I'm not opening the cafe.</b>

1057
01:00:06,509 --> 01:00:09,156
<b>Well... This isn't
your first time though.</b>

1058
01:00:09,180 --> 01:00:12,079
<b>I guess your family is
quite used to this.</b>

1059
01:00:12,650 --> 01:00:13,690
<b>What?</b>

1060
01:00:14,650 --> 01:00:16,136
<b>What did you just say?</b>

1061
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:17,589
<b>Am I wrong?</b>

1062
01:00:17,759 --> 01:00:18,936
<b>Because of your daughter,</b>

1063
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:21,029
<b>the whole country now knows
my son is divorced.</b>

1064
01:00:21,059 --> 01:00:22,206
<b>What are you going to do?</b>

1065
01:00:22,230 --> 01:00:23,830
<b>It's not like
he got divorced by himself.</b>

1066
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,775
<b>How is that Na Hee's fault?</b>

1067
01:00:25,799 --> 01:00:27,529
<b>Then is it because of Gyu Jin?</b>

1068
01:00:27,700 --> 01:00:31,369
<b>It's obviously because of
your daughter's nasty temper.</b>

1069
01:00:31,769 --> 01:00:33,140
<b>My gosh.</b>

1070
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:35,815
<b>How did you raise them to have three
of your children get divorced...</b>

1071
01:00:35,839 --> 01:00:37,410
<b>and the last one an annulment?</b>

1072
01:00:37,579 --> 01:00:40,426
<b>I guess I should make an association
for victims of the Song Family.</b>

1073
01:00:40,450 --> 01:00:42,279
<b>It'll be called VSF.</b>

1074
01:00:44,950 --> 01:00:47,196
<b>Are you done talking?</b>

1075
01:00:47,220 --> 01:00:49,126
<b>No, I'm not done yet.</b>

1076
01:00:49,150 --> 01:00:51,436
<b>Gyu Jin was born under a lucky star.</b>

1077
01:00:51,460 --> 01:00:54,259
<b>But he got involved
with some unlucky family.</b>

1078
01:00:55,289 --> 01:00:57,906
<b>I should stop.
I can't blame someone else.</b>

1079
01:00:57,930 --> 01:00:59,606
<b>It's my fault for not stopping him
from marrying her.</b>

1080
01:00:59,630 --> 01:01:02,640
<b>Hey, do you think
I didn't oppose the marriage?</b>

1081
01:01:02,769 --> 01:01:04,946
<b>I disapproved of their marriage
at first because of you.</b>

1082
01:01:04,970 --> 01:01:08,216
<b>Because her future mother-in-law
has such a horrible personality.</b>

1083
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:11,386
<b>What? What's wrong
about my personality?</b>

1084
01:01:11,410 --> 01:01:12,785
<b>Do you really not know that?</b>

1085
01:01:12,809 --> 01:01:15,285
<b>You are so moody and haughty.</b>

1086
01:01:15,309 --> 01:01:18,579
<b>Who would want her daughter
to have a mother-in-law like you?</b>

1087
01:01:19,690 --> 01:01:21,595
<b>And what? Some unlucky family?</b>

1088
01:01:21,619 --> 01:01:23,166
<b>What about you?</b>

1089
01:01:23,190 --> 01:01:26,765
<b>Are you so lucky that you lost
your husband at such a young age?</b>

1090
01:01:26,789 --> 01:01:27,936
<b>Is that it?</b>

1091
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:28,990
<b>My goodness.</b>

1092
01:01:30,099 --> 01:01:33,069
<b>Gosh, how could you
say such a thing?</b>

1093
01:01:33,529 --> 01:01:34,845
<b>Look who's talking.</b>

1094
01:01:34,869 --> 01:01:36,976
<b>You're the one who started it first,
you wench.</b>

1095
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:38,440
<b>Hey!</b>

1096
01:01:39,509 --> 01:01:42,740
<b>Are you crazy? How dare you hit me?
Do you think I can't hit you too?</b>

1097
01:01:42,910 --> 01:01:44,279
<b>Hey!</b>

1098
01:01:46,750 --> 01:01:48,680
<b>Oh my gosh!</b>

1099
01:01:50,119 --> 01:01:51,180
<b>Hey!</b>

1100
01:01:51,250 --> 01:01:52,990
<b>- Hey, let go.
- You!</b>

1101
01:01:53,089 --> 01:01:55,196
<b>Do you think
I can't do the same thing?</b>

1102
01:01:55,220 --> 01:01:57,295
<b>You wench.</b>

1103
01:01:57,319 --> 01:01:58,896
<b>Let go of my hair.</b>

1104
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:00,259
<b>Get off me!</b>

1105
01:02:00,930 --> 01:02:02,430
<b>You wench!</b>

1106
01:02:02,589 --> 01:02:04,936
<b>- Get off me!
- Let go!</b>

1107
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:06,706
<b>My gosh. Isn't that Mom?</b>

1108
01:02:06,730 --> 01:02:07,775
<b>It's her.</b>

1109
01:02:07,799 --> 01:02:09,640
<b>- Mom.
- Mom!</b>

1110
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,039
<b>Mom!</b>

1111
01:02:13,309 --> 01:02:14,539
<b>- Mom!
- Mom!</b>

1112
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:16,079
<b>Mom.</b>

1113
01:02:16,410 --> 01:02:17,856
<b>Mom, have you lost your mind?</b>

1114
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:19,656
<b>- What are you doing, Mom?
- Mom, let go.</b>

1115
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:21,226
<b>What's going on?</b>

1116
01:02:21,250 --> 01:02:23,356
<b>- My gosh.
- Let go.</b>

1117
01:02:23,380 --> 01:02:25,720
<b>- Calm down, Mom.
- Mom.</b>

1118
01:02:28,119 --> 01:02:31,065
<b>Get off me. Let go of me!</b>

1119
01:02:31,089 --> 01:02:32,265
<b>- Hey!
- Calm down.</b>

1120
01:02:32,289 --> 01:02:33,466
<b>What?</b>

1121
01:02:33,490 --> 01:02:34,735
<b>I'll kill you.</b>

1122
01:02:34,759 --> 01:02:35,866
<b>I'll kill you first.</b>

1123
01:02:35,890 --> 01:02:37,299
<b>Gosh, Mom.</b>

1124
01:02:39,829 --> 01:02:41,109
<b>- That wench.
- It hurts so much.</b>

1125
01:02:50,210 --> 01:02:53,450
<b>That wench. That darn nasty wench.</b>

1126
01:02:53,609 --> 01:02:55,726
<b>Does she think my children aren't
just as precious as hers?</b>

1127
01:02:55,750 --> 01:02:57,549
<b>Does she think
only her son is hurting?</b>

1128
01:02:57,579 --> 01:02:59,626
<b>How could she say such a thing?</b>

1129
01:02:59,650 --> 01:03:02,549
<b>What did she say to make you
get into a fight like that?</b>

1130
01:03:04,089 --> 01:03:05,795
<b>She said her precious son's life
is ruined...</b>

1131
01:03:05,819 --> 01:03:08,259
<b>because he got involved
with an unlucky family like us.</b>

1132
01:03:08,359 --> 01:03:11,505
<b>That all my children got divorced
because I raised them wrong.</b>

1133
01:03:11,529 --> 01:03:13,230
<b>That crazy lady.</b>

1134
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:18,069
<b>You should've told me sooner.
Then I wouldn't have stopped you.</b>

1135
01:03:18,569 --> 01:03:20,386
<b>There are things that you can say
and things you cannot.</b>

1136
01:03:20,410 --> 01:03:21,539
<b>Seriously...</b>

1137
01:03:22,140 --> 01:03:25,055
<b>Darn it.
Should I go right after her?</b>

1138
01:03:25,079 --> 01:03:26,856
<b>And start a new fight with her?</b>

1139
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:29,309
<b>- That...
- Ga Hee, not you too.</b>

1140
01:03:30,420 --> 01:03:31,720
<b>Sit down, Ga Hee.</b>

1141
01:03:33,490 --> 01:03:35,589
<b>Mom isn't entirely blameless.</b>

1142
01:03:38,789 --> 01:03:40,805
<b>She should've held back.</b>

1143
01:03:40,829 --> 01:03:43,599
<b>Why grab someone else by the hair
in the main street?</b>

1144
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:46,245
<b>What?</b>

1145
01:03:46,269 --> 01:03:48,869
<b>I'm so annoyed.</b>

1146
01:03:50,900 --> 01:03:52,670
<b>That viper.</b>

1147
01:03:53,539 --> 01:03:55,710
<b>How could she hit me where it hurts?</b>

1148
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:57,779
<b>I feel...</b>

1149
01:03:58,480 --> 01:03:59,880
<b>so, so upset.</b>

1150
01:04:00,710 --> 01:04:04,019
<b>Mom, stop. Will you stop crying?</b>

1151
01:04:04,319 --> 01:04:07,765
<b>From what I saw, you started it.</b>

1152
01:04:07,789 --> 01:04:09,589
<b>What? Was I wrong?</b>

1153
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:12,265
<b>Divorce is a tradition for them!</b>

1154
01:04:12,289 --> 01:04:15,206
<b>It's true that they ruined us!
Am I wrong?</b>

1155
01:04:15,230 --> 01:04:17,130
<b>Mom, please!</b>

1156
01:04:18,430 --> 01:04:20,700
<b>Will you please stop it?</b>

1157
01:04:21,269 --> 01:04:22,329
<b>What?</b>

1158
01:04:25,940 --> 01:04:29,039
<b>Why do you always
only think from your side?</b>

1159
01:04:29,609 --> 01:04:32,480
<b>Don't you care
even a little about others?</b>

1160
01:04:33,380 --> 01:04:37,750
<b>Don't you have any idea how much
what you said hurts them?</b>

1161
01:04:41,250 --> 01:04:44,720
<b>Just seeing her face
made me so angry.</b>

1162
01:04:44,819 --> 01:04:46,335
<b>I couldn't contain my fury.</b>

1163
01:04:46,359 --> 01:04:47,630
<b>It's not that you can't.</b>

1164
01:04:48,190 --> 01:04:51,430
<b>You don't hold back.
You don't even try to!</b>

1165
01:04:53,500 --> 01:04:56,575
<b>Mom, I didn't get divorced alone.
Both of us got divorced.</b>

1166
01:04:56,599 --> 01:04:58,515
<b>Na Hee is as distressed as I am,</b>

1167
01:04:58,539 --> 01:05:01,140
<b>and her mom is as furious
as you are.</b>

1168
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:03,985
<b>Why do you only think of
how upset you are?</b>

1169
01:05:04,009 --> 01:05:05,539
<b>Why are you so selfish?</b>

1170
01:05:05,809 --> 01:05:07,509
<b>How dare you talk like that?</b>

1171
01:05:08,380 --> 01:05:10,319
<b>Do you think I'm doing it for me?</b>

1172
01:05:10,549 --> 01:05:12,255
<b>I say what I do for your sake!</b>

1173
01:05:12,279 --> 01:05:13,690
<b>No, no!</b>

1174
01:05:15,250 --> 01:05:16,660
<b>That fight earlier.</b>

1175
01:05:17,690 --> 01:05:20,305
<b>And dragging me home
for dinner against my will.</b>

1176
01:05:20,329 --> 01:05:21,706
<b>It's all for you...</b>

1177
01:05:21,730 --> 01:05:23,799
<b>because you want
everything done your way!</b>

1178
01:05:25,430 --> 01:05:26,500
<b>What?</b>

1179
01:05:27,430 --> 01:05:29,299
<b>That's how you always are.</b>

1180
01:05:30,299 --> 01:05:31,976
<b>You do whatever you want,</b>

1181
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,470
<b>and get upset and annoyed
when the result isn't satisfactory.</b>

1182
01:05:36,380 --> 01:05:38,555
<b>Do you know how distressed
that made Na Hee?</b>

1183
01:05:38,579 --> 01:05:41,450
<b>Why wouldn't she be
when your own sons can't take it?</b>

1184
01:05:41,950 --> 01:05:44,025
<b>Do you think you have
no responsibility for our divorce?</b>

1185
01:05:44,049 --> 01:05:46,950
<b>No, you do!
You're very responsible!</b>

1186
01:05:48,450 --> 01:05:49,859
<b>How could you...</b>

1187
01:05:50,359 --> 01:05:51,490
<b>Jae Seok.</b>

1188
01:05:52,059 --> 01:05:53,890
<b>What is your brother saying?</b>

1189
01:05:54,789 --> 01:05:56,759
<b>Mom, that goes for Jae Seok too.</b>

1190
01:05:57,359 --> 01:05:59,799
<b>Why do you think
he trained in Turkey?</b>

1191
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:02,805
<b>He couldn't take your obsessiveness
and wanted to get away.</b>

1192
01:06:02,829 --> 01:06:04,970
<b>That's why he went so far away!</b>

1193
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:11,039
<b>Is that true?</b>

1194
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:13,680
<b>Is it true, you jerk?</b>

1195
01:06:13,710 --> 01:06:15,726
<b>Get out. Get out of here.</b>

1196
01:06:15,750 --> 01:06:18,055
<b>- Get out of this house.
- Mom.</b>

1197
01:06:18,079 --> 01:06:20,795
<b>If you want to lecture me
and say the right thing, get out.</b>

1198
01:06:20,819 --> 01:06:22,995
<b>- Mom, Mom.
- Get out!</b>

1199
01:06:23,019 --> 01:06:27,406
<b>Whose fault is it that
I got into a fight in the market?</b>

1200
01:06:27,430 --> 01:06:31,275
<b>Whose fault is it that
I shed tears and got mocked?</b>

1201
01:06:31,299 --> 01:06:34,146
<b>Mom, will you please
not get so worked up?</b>

1202
01:06:34,170 --> 01:06:35,670
<b>- Yes, Mom.
- Mom, don't.</b>

1203
01:06:35,769 --> 01:06:39,275
<b>That isn't what she meant.
She was just upset too.</b>

1204
01:06:39,299 --> 01:06:40,410
<b>Let go!</b>

1205
01:06:40,740 --> 01:06:44,140
<b>Yes. You're all on her side,
aren't you?</b>

1206
01:06:44,339 --> 01:06:48,450
<b>You're all united for once
because you're sisters.</b>

1207
01:06:48,579 --> 01:06:50,555
<b>Yes, I get it now.</b>

1208
01:06:50,579 --> 01:06:54,319
<b>It's because you all put
a stake through my heart as well!</b>

1209
01:06:55,690 --> 01:06:58,095
<b>Mom. What has gotten into you?</b>

1210
01:06:58,119 --> 01:07:00,706
<b>Why are you suddenly
taking it out on us?</b>

1211
01:07:00,730 --> 01:07:02,136
<b>Mom, we just...</b>

1212
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:03,299
<b>Forget it!</b>

1213
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:06,829
<b>I don't need any of you!</b>

1214
01:07:10,099 --> 01:07:11,299
<b>I'm home.</b>

1215
01:07:13,369 --> 01:07:14,970
<b>What is it? What's wrong?</b>

1216
01:07:15,470 --> 01:07:17,240
<b>What's the matter, Mom?</b>

1217
01:07:18,410 --> 01:07:19,387
<b>What is it?</b>

1218
01:07:19,411 --> 01:07:21,579
<b>Mom, it's not like that.</b>

1219
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:23,079
<b>What is it, then?</b>

1220
01:07:23,380 --> 01:07:24,696
<b>What is it, you jerk?</b>

1221
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:26,366
<b>Okay, Mom, so...</b>

1222
01:07:26,390 --> 01:07:29,126
<b>Rather than wanting to
get away from you,</b>

1223
01:07:29,150 --> 01:07:30,430
<b>I wanted to get some experience.</b>

1224
01:07:30,589 --> 01:07:33,259
<b>Say something.
She got the wrong idea.</b>

1225
01:07:35,059 --> 01:07:38,329
<b>How... How could you do this to me?</b>

1226
01:07:39,259 --> 01:07:41,599
<b>How could you both betray me?</b>

1227
01:07:41,900 --> 01:07:43,500
<b>After your dad died,</b>

1228
01:07:43,940 --> 01:07:46,940
<b>to think of
what I did to raise you...</b>

1229
01:07:47,470 --> 01:07:48,785
<b>How could you?</b>

1230
01:07:48,809 --> 01:07:51,279
<b>Mom, why would you say that?</b>

1231
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:52,956
<b>- Why...
- I don't need you.</b>

1232
01:07:52,980 --> 01:07:54,726
<b>- I don't need sons.
- Mom.</b>

1233
01:07:54,750 --> 01:07:56,450
<b>I don't need you. Get out.</b>

1234
01:07:56,750 --> 01:07:58,019
<b>Get out. I'm done with you.</b>

1235
01:07:58,119 --> 01:07:59,849
<b>- Wait, Mom.
- I don't care.</b>

1236
01:08:06,690 --> 01:08:08,089
<b>All four of you!</b>

1237
01:08:08,259 --> 01:08:10,099
<b>The two of you.</b>

1238
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:16,376
<b>Get out!</b>

1239
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:19,269
<b>Get out!</b>

1240
01:08:40,259 --> 01:08:42,789
<b>(Once Again)</b>

1241
01:08:43,529 --> 01:08:45,500
<b>What is this mess?</b>

1242
01:08:45,599 --> 01:08:46,576
<b>I bet I'm the only forty-year-old...</b>

1243
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:48,630
<b>to get kicked out of the house
by his mom.</b>

1244
01:08:48,970 --> 01:08:51,416
<b>Do you know how hard it is
to get the crumbs out?</b>

1245
01:08:51,440 --> 01:08:53,545
<b>- Clean up right now.
- You're so tiresome.</b>

1246
01:08:53,569 --> 01:08:55,186
<b>Let me help you.</b>

1247
01:08:55,210 --> 01:08:57,309
<b>What? You?</b>

1248
01:08:58,509 --> 01:08:59,616
<b>Mr. Yoon.</b>

1249
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:01,150
<b>Ms. Song.</b>

1250
01:09:01,250 --> 01:09:02,956
<b>Director. Just give me a chance.</b>

1251
01:09:02,980 --> 01:09:04,519
<b>I'll even put my life on the line.</b>

1252
01:09:04,720 --> 01:09:06,049
<b>- Excuse me.
- Sure.</b>

1253
01:09:06,589 --> 01:09:08,490
<b>Yes, Chief. What?</b>

1254
01:09:08,890 --> 01:09:10,059
<b>I understand.</b>

1255
01:09:10,490 --> 01:09:12,595
<b>Gyu Jin, you know about my hunch.</b>

1256
01:09:12,619 --> 01:09:15,535
<b>That's more flirting
than being friendly colleagues.</b>

1257
01:09:15,559 --> 01:09:17,439
<b>At least one of them has feelings
for the other.</b>
