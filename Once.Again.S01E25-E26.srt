(Cohabitation Contract)

2
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:14,250
What is this, Gyu Jin?

3
00:00:14,509 --> 00:00:15,880
(Episode 25)

4
00:00:20,119 --> 00:00:21,220
Mother.

5
00:00:21,919 --> 00:00:23,620
I want water.

6
00:00:24,789 --> 00:00:25,789
You're home.

7
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:27,859
(Cohabitation Contract)

8
00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:33,399
I asked you what this is.

9
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:37,170
Mother...

10
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:39,339
This is...

11
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:40,700
Na Hee.

12
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:44,939
You tell me.

13
00:00:46,939 --> 00:00:48,880
What's this cohabitation contract,

14
00:00:50,149 --> 00:00:53,579
and why does it mention
the finalization of a divorce?

15
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:07,159
What is this about?

16
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:12,439
Mother, it's... You see...

17
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,439
We got divorced, Mom.

18
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:22,180
What?

19
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:24,579
What did you just say?

20
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:26,280
Na Hee.

21
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:28,650
We're divorced.

22
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:30,620
We have been for some time.

23
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:36,530
Wait. Hold on.

24
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:39,959
What on earth are you talking about?

25
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,829
Why would you get a divorce?

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,200
Why would you end your marriage?

27
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,109
Why would you...

28
00:01:48,209 --> 00:01:49,840
Why would you get a divorce?

29
00:01:49,969 --> 00:01:51,885
- Why would you...
- Mom, hold on.

30
00:01:51,909 --> 00:01:52,986
- Why...
- Calm down, Mom.

31
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:55,310
- Mother, please.
- Why are you divorced?

32
00:01:55,909 --> 00:01:57,085
- Right.
- Get her a bag.

33
00:01:57,109 --> 00:01:58,879
- Mom, are you all right?
- Why?

34
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,989
What's this?

35
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:03,549
Why would auntie and uncle
be divorced?

36
00:02:03,819 --> 00:02:05,060
This is outrageous.

37
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,890
Tell me about it.

38
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:11,500
I can't believe people
would start such vicious rumors.

39
00:02:11,799 --> 00:02:13,459
A divorce?

40
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,006
That's insane. Right, Joon Seon?

41
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:16,969
What? Yes, exactly.

42
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:19,545
I heard about how nasty
people could be online.

43
00:02:19,569 --> 00:02:22,316
They're the worst, aren't they?

44
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:23,669
Unbelievable.

45
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,439
Shouldn't we report
these people to the police?

46
00:02:26,539 --> 00:02:27,586
Let's tell Aunt Na Hee.

47
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:30,485
No, don't. There's no need to.

48
00:02:30,509 --> 00:02:31,750
But still...

49
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:35,120
(Na Hee)

50
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:38,936
Na Hee, things are bad...

51
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,060
Ga Hee, Mom just fainted.

52
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:42,860
We're on our way to the ER.

53
00:02:43,259 --> 00:02:44,259
What?

54
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:47,746
Why? Why would Mom suddenly faint?

55
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:49,605
- What?
- Mom fainted.

56
00:02:49,629 --> 00:02:50,770
She fainted?

57
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:00,316
Na Hee? Mom!

58
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,825
- Mom?
- Mom, are you all right?

59
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:02,925
- Mom...
- The doctor gave her a sedative...

60
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:04,150
and she just went to sleep.

61
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:06,580
She was hyperventilating
and convulsing.

62
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:08,490
It's why I told you to tell her.

63
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:11,219
I said it'll only shock her more
if you drag this along.

64
00:03:11,389 --> 00:03:12,936
Why don't you ever listen?

65
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,765
Joon Seon, keep it down.

66
00:03:14,789 --> 00:03:16,129
We're sorry, Joon Seon.

67
00:03:16,259 --> 00:03:17,936
You're just as responsible.

68
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,460
How can you let it get this far?

69
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:24,169
You know how much
my mother adores you.

70
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:26,199
What a jerk.

71
00:03:26,469 --> 00:03:30,645
You know, I withdrew this
to pay this month's rent,

72
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:31,909
but take it first.

73
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,280
Joon Seon, there's no need...

74
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:38,819
I'll pay you back the rest
as soon as I make the money.

75
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:41,349
- You borrowed money from him?
- Yes.

76
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:45,096
How is that important
right now though...

77
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,689
when Mom is in a hospital?

78
00:03:51,129 --> 00:03:52,360
How did she find out?

79
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,445
I doubt she read
the online comments.

80
00:03:55,469 --> 00:03:56,629
Online comments?

81
00:03:57,629 --> 00:03:59,000
I don't think she knows.

("Couple Doctors Yoon and Song

(Yoon and Song
are actually divorced.)

There are over 1,500 comments.

87
00:04:18,789 --> 00:04:21,590
Meanwhile, you also stabbed
Mom and Dad in the back.

88
00:04:21,659 --> 00:04:23,179
So what are you going
to do about this?

89
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,636
Say something? What will you do?

90
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:27,029
Joon Seon, keep it down.

91
00:04:28,329 --> 00:04:30,430
Dad?

92
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:36,670
Father.

93
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,209
Dad.

94
00:04:52,589 --> 00:04:56,060
Did either one of you
cheat on the other?

95
00:04:57,629 --> 00:04:58,899
- No.
- No.

96
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,170
Was money involved then?

97
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:04,899
Did one of you
guarantee someone's debt?

98
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:08,540
- That's not the case.
- No, Father.

99
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:11,980
Then what?

100
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,310
Why did you get divorced?

101
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:16,649
You two had a good marriage,

102
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:19,220
so why did you suddenly
decide to call it quits?

103
00:05:25,589 --> 00:05:26,669
Irreconcilable differences.

104
00:05:28,129 --> 00:05:29,160
What?

105
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:33,959
I thought it was stupid
when people got divorced...

106
00:05:35,029 --> 00:05:36,569
over irreconcilable differences.

107
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,600
Is that even an excuse?

108
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:41,069
People are born
to be unique and different.

109
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:42,370
But...

110
00:05:44,069 --> 00:05:45,810
now I understand
how important it is.

111
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,956
If that is truly
a major reason for divorce,

112
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:54,050
your mom and I would've
gotten at least hundreds of them.

113
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:57,726
Compromising and sacrificing...

114
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:58,819
For how long?

115
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,435
It's been torture,

116
00:06:01,459 --> 00:06:03,660
and I've been lonely and unhappy.

117
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,360
So, for how long must I endure it?

118
00:06:08,569 --> 00:06:09,829
It's unbearable.

119
00:06:10,699 --> 00:06:12,170
We're only torturing ourselves.

120
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:25,149
I'm sorry...

121
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:29,449
for disappointing you.

122
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:33,660
I'm truly sorry.

Mr. Yoon,

126
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:19,839
can I get you another beverage?

127
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:23,069
I'm good,
so don't mind me and study.

128
00:07:30,779 --> 00:07:32,050
Aren't you going home?

129
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:35,026
Well, I'm a little exhausted today,

130
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:36,650
so I'm waiting
until my mom falls asleep.

131
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:39,319
Why? Am I bothering you?

132
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:41,089
No, of course not.

133
00:07:44,189 --> 00:07:46,600
Actually, yes.
You're bothering me quite a bit.

134
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I can't focus on these questions.

135
00:07:49,899 --> 00:07:53,269
Gosh, that's harsh.
You're being too brutal now.

136
00:07:56,509 --> 00:08:00,079
I won't let out a squeak,
so go back to your studies.

137
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:10,389
Goodness.

138
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:18,899
What? Are you serious?
That won't get you to the answer.

139
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:20,230
That...

140
00:08:21,529 --> 00:08:24,769
Okay, got it. I'll shut up.

141
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:33,009
Ga Hee, what is it?

142
00:08:33,939 --> 00:08:35,180
I'm at the cafe.

143
00:08:36,079 --> 00:08:39,149
What? So what happened?
Is Mom okay?

144
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,919
Sure thing. I'll be right there.

145
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,995
What's wrong?
Is something up with your family?

146
00:08:46,019 --> 00:08:49,235
Yes, Mom found out about
Na Hee and Gyu Jin.

147
00:08:49,259 --> 00:08:51,436
She fainted
so they took her to the ER...

148
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:52,929
and now they're heading home.

149
00:08:53,029 --> 00:08:54,360
I should get going.

150
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:59,700
Anyway, your mom
will find out soon too.

151
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:02,139
I hear that someone
wrote about it online.

152
00:09:02,269 --> 00:09:04,169
I'll leave you
to deal with her, okay?

153
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,780
What do you mean
someone wrote about it online?

154
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:15,750
What the...

155
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:17,995
Da Hee,
how about we close up early...

156
00:09:18,019 --> 00:09:20,336
What are you doing here?
Where's Da Hee?

157
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,836
Something urgent came up,
so she left.

158
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,460
Something urgent? As in what?

159
00:09:24,029 --> 00:09:25,659
You'll soon find out.

160
00:09:26,529 --> 00:09:28,976
Mom, how's your blood pressure
and heart?

161
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,029
Are they both fine?

162
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:33,539
Why are you suddenly
asking about my health?

163
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:34,785
What is this about?

164
00:09:34,809 --> 00:09:37,470
Mom, please sit.

165
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,980
Let's take a few deep breaths.

166

What's going on?

167
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,620
Just tell me.
You know how impatient I am.

00:09:51,019 --> 00:09:52,059
Mom,

169
00:09:53,419 --> 00:09:54,490
Gyu Jin...

170
00:09:55,059 --> 00:09:56,059
got divorced.

171
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,629
Divorced? When? When did it happen?

172
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:03,870
Mom,

173
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:07,669
please calm down
and have a sip of this.

174
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:10,370
Let's be rational.

175
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:13,740
So when was it?

176
00:10:15,309 --> 00:10:17,610
When exactly
did you sign the papers?

177
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:22,350
It's been a little over a month.

178
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:25,059
What? A month?

179
00:10:29,389 --> 00:10:30,460
Why?

180
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:32,429
For what reason?

181
00:10:33,429 --> 00:10:35,970
Did you cheat on Na Hee or hit her?

182
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:38,899
No way. She'd never let
anyone do that to her.

183
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:43,269
Don't tell me that
she's been hitting you.

184
00:10:44,139 --> 00:10:46,110
Mom, that's not it.

185
00:10:47,809 --> 00:10:50,885
It just happened, all right?
I'm sorry.

186
00:10:50,909 --> 00:10:53,296
What did I tell you from the get-go?

187
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,789
I said that you weren't
meant for each other.

188
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:58,495
Remember her reaction
when I told you...

189
00:10:58,519 --> 00:11:00,966
about the shaman who said Na Hee...

190
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:02,289
would swallow you whole?

191
00:11:02,789 --> 00:11:05,460
"No one believes in such
superstitions anymore, Mother."

192
00:11:06,429 --> 00:11:08,905
This is what she does
after making me look...

193
00:11:08,929 --> 00:11:10,576
like an old-fashioned hag?

194
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,500
My son is now divorced
because of her!

195
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:16,015
Mom, it's not just me.
She's a divorcee too,

196
00:11:16,039 --> 00:11:17,710
- so stop...
- Shut it!

197
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:21,015
Do you really want to take her side
even amidst all this, you moron?

198
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:22,956
I know you're upset, Mom,

199
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:25,025
but not as much as Gyu Jin
and my sister-in-law.

200
00:11:25,049 --> 00:11:27,179
Sister-in-law? They're divorced now!

201
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:34,220
You know what? This is for the best.

202
00:11:34,889 --> 00:11:37,405
You're still young and you have
your whole life ahead of you.

203
00:11:37,429 --> 00:11:38,960
You can meet someone better.

204
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:42,875
Her family was never
right for you anyway!

205
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:45,046
Mom, please...

206
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:47,346
Mom, Gyu Jin's divorce
is still quite fresh.

207
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:49,645
It's too early to say those things.

208
00:11:49,669 --> 00:11:51,070
Well, I'm that upset!

209
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:54,879
I blame myself for
not disapproving hard enough.

210
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:58,720
Unbelievable. Are you kidding me?

211
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:05,220
Mom, I bet you want to lie down.

212
00:12:05,389 --> 00:12:07,135
Shouldn't you eat something?

213
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:09,529
How about some porridge
or ground-up rice?

214
00:12:10,259 --> 00:12:11,706
They're practically the same thing.

215
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:12,707
How are they the same?

216
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:14,836
Porridge has chunks in them
while ground-up rice doesn't.

217
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:17,899
Mom! Mom...

218
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:22,145
My goodness.
Look at how pale you are.

219
00:12:22,169 --> 00:12:23,645
Shouldn't you have stayed
at the hospital?

220
00:12:23,669 --> 00:12:24,909
Are you sure you're okay?

221
00:12:25,309 --> 00:12:27,186
Your mom will be fine,

222
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:29,450
so leave the room and let her rest.

223
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:30,610
Sure.

224
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:32,250
Mom, get some rest.

225
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:33,649
Goodnight, Mom.

226
00:12:50,129 --> 00:12:52,200
You three, come and have a seat.

227
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:04,480
When did you find out about it?

228
00:13:04,549 --> 00:13:06,080
You knew about it, right?

229
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:10,426
When did you find out? Tell me.

230
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:14,296
I was the first one to know, Dad.
I found it out two weeks ago.

231
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,135
And we heard it last week.
About three days ago to be exact.

232
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:19,330
Is it four days?

233
00:13:19,629 --> 00:13:22,230
Anyway, it's been less than a week.

234
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:27,539
We told Na Hee to tell the truth
as soon as possible,

235
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:30,216
but she asked us
to wait a little more.

236
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,539
Still,

237
00:13:32,509 --> 00:13:34,580
how could you pretend
not to know about it?

238
00:13:35,149 --> 00:13:37,785
Do you still call yourselves
her brother and sisters?

239
00:13:37,809 --> 00:13:38,919
I'm sorry.

240
00:13:39,149 --> 00:13:40,580
We were wrong, Dad.

241
00:13:40,679 --> 00:13:42,720
It's my fault.

242
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:46,296
I found out about it first,
but I was afraid to tell you.

243
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,460
I'm sorry.

244
00:13:51,429 --> 00:13:53,730
How could you guys do this to me?

245
00:13:55,269 --> 00:13:56,970
How could all four of you...

246
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,370
This is unbelievable.

247
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:03,639
You guys are just unbelievable.

248
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,240
Dad.

249
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,509
Dad...

250
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:11,679
This is crazy.

251
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,139
Is Ms. Choi all right?

252
00:14:41,409 --> 00:14:43,980
The worst is over on our end.
What about your family?

253
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:47,419
They are devastated.

254
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,389
What did Ms. Choi say?

255
00:14:54,919 --> 00:14:56,059
Hello?

256
00:14:56,159 --> 00:14:57,330
Yes, Mr. Yoon.

257
00:14:57,759 --> 00:14:59,919
I was going to text you,
but I just called you instead.

258
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,870
Is Ms. Jang's condition really bad?

259
00:15:02,529 --> 00:15:03,730
I'm afraid so.

260
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:06,340
She's not saying anything.

261
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,210
What about Ms. Choi?
She's furious, isn't she?

262
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,509
Of course.
She is going on and on furiously.

263
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:15,179
She's cursing with words
that I can't even dare to repeat.

264
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:19,279
Come to think of it,
we're like enemies.

265
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,779
How did we end up like this?

266
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,250
I know.

267
00:15:26,289 --> 00:15:28,159
And it's not just about Mom.

268
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:31,129
I'm worried more about tomorrow.
I mean the hospital.

269
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:34,600
Oh, the comments.
I can only imagine.

270
00:15:35,929 --> 00:15:37,745
What are Na Hee
and Gyu Jin going to do?

271
00:15:37,769 --> 00:15:40,100
The hospital director is
quite hot-tempered.

272
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:43,169
There will be a big fuss
at the hospital.

273
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:48,110
What is this all about?

274
00:15:49,179 --> 00:15:51,750
You should've told me
about it sooner.

275
00:15:52,049 --> 00:15:54,779
Look what you did
to the hospital's reputation.

276
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:57,120
I'm sorry, sir.

277
00:15:57,950 --> 00:15:59,159
I'm sorry.

278
00:16:00,019 --> 00:16:03,960
I told you to promote our hospital,
but you become the talk of the town.

279
00:16:05,129 --> 00:16:07,899
Some are even calling it
a publicity stunt.

280
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:10,429
Is that true?
Is that what you intended?

281
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:12,046
No, it's not like that.

282
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:13,350
You should've been more patient.

283
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:16,446
Why couldn't you just get along?

284
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:19,710
I will take full responsibility
and resign.

285
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:21,279
I will...

286
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:23,549
quit my job too.

287
00:16:23,809 --> 00:16:24,809
What?

288
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:26,750
Then what?

289
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:28,859
As if we have anyone to replace you?

290
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:32,836
You can't just quit
without any kind of plan.

291
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:34,960
How could you be so irresponsible?

292
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:40,259
Director Jang.

293
00:16:40,629 --> 00:16:41,759
- Director Jang.
- Gosh.

294
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:44,370
- Loosen your tie.
- Just go away.

295
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:53,539
Are we done getting yelled at?

296
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,509
Who knows?
There might be someone else.

297
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:59,179
How is Mother doing?

298
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:03,149
What about your mom?

299
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:05,149
She's enraged.

300
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:07,620
I knew she'd be like that,

301
00:17:08,289 --> 00:17:09,759
but it's just too hard to deal with.

302
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:13,070
Let's just think
it's the punishment we deserve.

303
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:14,829
We were expecting this
to begin with.

304
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,670
She's so heartless.

305
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:21,845
So heartless.

306
00:17:21,869 --> 00:17:24,069
("Couple doctors Song and Yoon
revealed to be divorced")

307
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:27,640
The comments are so harsh.

308
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,579
This is way too much.

309
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:32,519
It was bound to happen.

310
00:17:32,579 --> 00:17:34,656
There were even articles
that said they had good chemistry.

311
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:37,049
People probably feel
like they were fooled.

312
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,866
It's obviously tarnishing
the hospital's image.

313
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:42,930
Dr. Yoon.
You knew about it, didn't you?

314
00:17:43,859 --> 00:17:46,799
Yes, I did.
I'm an accomplice in this.

315
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,230
I aided and abetted their fraud.

316
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,099
So go ahead and criticize me too.
I will take the heat about that.

317
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,309
Hey, we're not criticizing them.

318
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:01,880
We're just worried.

319
00:18:02,809 --> 00:18:03,980
I know.

320
00:18:04,109 --> 00:18:07,380
I don't know about Dr. Song,
but I do feel bad for Dr. Yoon.

321
00:18:07,579 --> 00:18:10,589
Honestly, he's probably the one
who put up with Dr. Song.

322
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:12,466
Isn't it obvious?

323
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:15,095
It's so obvious.
I can almost see it now.

324
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:17,835
You know Dr. Song has
an aggressive personality.

325
00:18:17,859 --> 00:18:21,035
I would never marry a woman
as scary as her.

326
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:23,146
I'd rather kill myself.

327
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:25,646
She would nitpick
at everything I do. Gosh.

328
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:26,700
Who said so?

329
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:31,309
Who said I put up with her?

330
00:18:35,009 --> 00:18:36,689
Are you guys such good judges
of character?

331
00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:39,119
Are you mind-readers or what?

332
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:45,319
Don't shoot your mouth off
when you don't know anything.

333
00:18:46,289 --> 00:18:48,059
I'm the one who nags at home.

334
00:18:48,319 --> 00:18:50,589
I'm a neat freak. I have mysophobia.

335
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:52,900
Did you not see that?

336
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:58,269
Darn.

337
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,250
Don't you dare
say things like that again.

338
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:12,680
This is a warning.

339
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,985
- Song Na Hee speaking.
- Hello, Dr. Song.

340
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:37,815
This is An Hyun Joon,
a fellow at Sejin Hospital.

341
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:40,380
I'm calling to update you
on Yo Han's surgery.

342
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:42,386
The surgery went well,

343
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:44,349
so we can start rehabilitation
right away.

344
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:47,595
Really? I see.

345
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:49,196
Okay. Thank you.

346
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:52,460
We'd like to have him transferred.
When is it convenient for you?

347
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:57,305
(Sejin Hospital)

348
00:19:57,329 --> 00:19:58,829
(Sejin Hospital)

349
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:03,000
Na Hee must be upset.

350
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:05,470
No wonder.

351
00:20:10,009 --> 00:20:11,069
Hey.

352
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,809
You're not here to meet me, are you?

353
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:16,956
Well, not really.

354
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:19,250
Is it telepathy or what?
I just wanted to come this way.

355
00:20:20,019 --> 00:20:21,380
I wanted to thank you.

356
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:22,980
I heard Yo Han's surgery
was successful.

357
00:20:23,089 --> 00:20:25,619
Sure. Of course it was successful.
I took care of it.

358
00:20:26,259 --> 00:20:27,490
I know.

359
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:30,190
Are you all right?

360
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:38,730
- Here.
- Thank you.

361
00:20:42,109 --> 00:20:43,809
You're good at surprising people.

362
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:47,410
To be honest, I was shocked too.

363
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:50,950
I know.

364
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:54,279
It's harsher than I thought though.

365
00:20:54,779 --> 00:20:56,920
My name is all over the internet.

366
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:59,319
What made you decide
to appear on TV?

367
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:02,089
It must've felt uncomfortable
to be on TV as a couple.

368
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:06,376
My parents didn't know
about my divorce.

369
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,160
And when the casting offer came,

370
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,920
the hospital director
practically forced us.

371
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:13,200
If I knew it would cause
so much trouble to the show,

372
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:15,809
I would've refused the offer.

373
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:21,116
People would say malicious comments
were a social issue,

374
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:23,509
but I didn't care about it
all that much.

375
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:25,180
But now that it's happening to me,

376
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:28,750
I find it hard to deal with
even when I'm quite bold.

377
00:21:30,519 --> 00:21:33,220
I understand people calling us
a pair of tricksters.

378
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:36,029
But they even tell us to
quit our jobs and kill ourselves.

379
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:41,059
I'm not sure
if I did something that bad.

380
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:43,769
Don't trouble yourself.

381
00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:45,799
They just want
something to gossip about.

382
00:21:46,539 --> 00:21:49,740
Apparently, I'm called
the Icy-Cold Witch online.

383
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,769
It sounds about right.

384
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:54,609
That's a good nickname.

385
00:21:57,309 --> 00:21:58,609
You know what?

386
00:21:58,779 --> 00:22:01,379
Ice begins to melt as soon as
the temperature rises by one degree.

387
00:22:01,779 --> 00:22:04,589
You seem to get hurt
more easily than you look.

388
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:06,660
Am I wrong?

389
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:10,529
I don't know.

390
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:13,500
I'm not even sure about myself.

391
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,599
I can tell what you're like.

392
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:21,599
Let's go.
I have afternoon appointments.

393
00:22:23,009 --> 00:22:25,169
Make sure to get the data
from Dr. An on your way back.

394
00:22:25,369 --> 00:22:27,689
We took the biopsy and there wasn't
any sign of metastasis.

395
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,910
Thank you. I'll see you later.

396
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:32,619
My pleasure.

397
00:22:33,049 --> 00:22:34,150
Bye.

398
00:22:41,059 --> 00:22:42,230
Yes, Mom.

399
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:44,460
Don't you dare talk to me like that.

400
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:47,529
I'm the one who should be
giving you a deep sigh.

401
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:50,269
Why are you calling me?
What do you want?

402
00:22:50,329 --> 00:22:52,799
When will you sell the apartment?

403
00:22:53,299 --> 00:22:54,940
Will you go on living with her?

404
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,740
We notified the real estate agent...

405
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:01,285
Let me deal with it, Mom.

406
00:23:01,309 --> 00:23:03,150
What can you deal with?

407
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:06,696
Shall I call an agent I know?
If I offer more commission money...

408
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,025
Mom, I'll deal with it.

409
00:23:08,049 --> 00:23:11,595
I want to sort out
some other issues first.

410
00:23:11,619 --> 00:23:14,519
Why do something that
needs sorting out? Hang up!

411
00:23:18,789 --> 00:23:19,960
Why does she keep...

412
00:23:24,769 --> 00:23:26,700
- Hi, Bo Young.
- Gyu Jin.

413
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,186
Can you talk?

414
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:31,710
Yes, well... I'm free.

415
00:23:32,339 --> 00:23:35,339
I wasn't sure whether to call or not
but I was worried.

416
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:38,079
Are you all right?

417
00:23:38,849 --> 00:23:40,129
You were surprised, weren't you?

418
00:23:40,819 --> 00:23:42,289
Things just happened.

419
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:47,920
I finally understood
what you said last time.

420
00:23:49,529 --> 00:23:52,630
It must've been tough for you.
Even more so now.

421
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:56,930
Well, it's fine. It'll pass.

422
00:23:57,369 --> 00:23:58,369
Well...

423
00:23:59,539 --> 00:24:02,410
I have to deal with it.
It's my fault.

424
00:24:03,769 --> 00:24:04,839
Okay.

425
00:24:06,039 --> 00:24:08,240
Call me whenever you need me.

426
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,180
Whether it's food or coffee,
I'll buy you anything.

427
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:12,980
Okay.

428
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:15,049
Thanks for calling.

429
00:24:15,849 --> 00:24:17,089
Cheer up.

430
00:24:18,319 --> 00:24:19,819
Take care. Bye.

431
00:24:43,109 --> 00:24:46,019
(Closed today for personal reasons!)

432
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:53,220
The darn brats never let us
have a day of peace.

433
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,565
How could Na Hee do this to us
as well?

434
00:24:56,589 --> 00:25:00,299
We got stabbed in the back
by the person we trusted the most.

435
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,299
Are you going home? Hop on.

436
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:06,900
You go ahead.
I'll get some groceries.

437
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:21,480
I don't think Lady Luck
cares much for that family.

438
00:25:22,279 --> 00:25:25,966
She was so excited that her daughter
and son-in-law were on TV,

439
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:29,559
she even threw a party
and celebrated.

440
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:34,706
How did that daughter
end up divorced in just two days?

441
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:39,116
Exactly. You get sick
if you eat too much at a party.

442
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:41,170
She celebrated way too much.

443
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,809
She was down for a while
after her youngest got an annulment.

444
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:46,956
She was so haughty
about the TV show.

445
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:51,950
At this rate, shouldn't she get in
the Guinness Book of World Records?

446
00:25:52,779 --> 00:25:55,196
It's rare for 100 percent
of your kids to be divorced.

447
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,525
"The youngest got an annulment!"

448
00:25:57,549 --> 00:26:00,089
That's what Ok Boon
would've said if she heard.

449
00:26:06,359 --> 00:26:07,430
Sorry.

450
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:12,440
What was that?
Did he do that on purpose?

451
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:15,170
What? He couldn't have.

452
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,170
The fishcake needs to cool.

453
00:26:17,369 --> 00:26:18,686
- Cho Yeon!
- My gosh.

454
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:20,940
Cho Yeon! Cho Yeon, Cho Yeon.

455
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,426
She heard gossip.

456
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:26,480
Why do you dress
weirder and weirder each day?

457
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,019
What is it?

458
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:31,466
The second daughter of the president
who runs the fried chicken place.

459
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:33,595
She came on his birthday...

460
00:26:33,619 --> 00:26:35,366
and signed autographs
and acted over the top.

461
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:37,160
- Yes.
- What about her?

462
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:40,436
That daughter
and her husband got divorced.

463
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:42,035
Over a month ago!

464
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:43,476
What? For real?

465
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,845
What are you saying?

466
00:26:44,869 --> 00:26:47,275
They went on TV
and said they were married?

467
00:26:47,299 --> 00:26:51,416
Yes, but the president and his wife
found out just now.

468
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:55,156
His wife lost her mind
and passed out, causing a fuss.

469
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:57,186
The fried chicken joint
is closed today.

470
00:26:57,210 --> 00:27:00,025
My goodness. How did that happen?

471
00:27:00,049 --> 00:27:03,795
- She adored those two.
- Yes.

472
00:27:03,819 --> 00:27:06,696
Aren't her older son and daughter
divorced and living at home too?

473
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,936
Yes. Everyone in the market
gathered around...

474
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,565
to talk about that family.

475
00:27:11,589 --> 00:27:13,936
Everyone is whispering
and gossiping.

476
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:14,976
It's no joke.

477
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,230
Too bad.

478
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:19,299
The president must be really upset.

479
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,910
Stop doing that. How can you focus?

480
00:27:26,509 --> 00:27:29,585
Give it back. My problems
should be kept separate from work.

481
00:27:29,609 --> 00:27:31,880
I have to update that today.

482
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:34,295
I'll do it. Leave it to me.

483
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:35,825
I have to notify everyone...

484
00:27:35,849 --> 00:27:38,466
that the recycling truck will be
coming at a different time now.

485
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:41,559
I'll do that as well. Leave it.
You just chat with me.

486
00:27:49,029 --> 00:27:50,400
How's your wife?

487
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,799
Shouldn't you be at home?

488
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,116
I left because I thought
I'd only be in the way.

489
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:57,809
She's better off alone.

490
00:27:58,369 --> 00:28:01,240
I guess nothing can comfort her now.

491
00:28:01,339 --> 00:28:03,079
She wouldn't want to hear anything.

492
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:08,049
It's so devastating.
Even I feel brokenhearted.

493
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:12,920
How could all four of them
do this to their parents?

494
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:14,589
I know.

495
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:18,559
I must've wronged
all four of them in my past life.

496
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:23,369
Yes. Think of it that way
and let it go.

497
00:28:23,769 --> 00:28:27,740
Don't feel wronged or guilty.

498
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:33,740
Aren't you going to
the kimbap place today?

499
00:28:34,009 --> 00:28:36,886
I may be head over heels in love,

500
00:28:36,910 --> 00:28:39,210
but how can I leave
a friend in distress?

501
00:28:39,579 --> 00:28:41,456
I'm not that disloyal.

502
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,819
What do you think of me?

503
00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:49,906
Thanks a lot.
I feel so touched I could cry.

504
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:52,230
Right? Aren't I the best friend?

505
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:55,559
A man puts loyalty
before love, okay?

506
00:28:55,829 --> 00:28:56,869
Loyalty.

507
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:58,805
My gosh.

508
00:28:58,829 --> 00:29:03,440
(Unnie's Kimbap)

509
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:11,009
I wish I could see
Cho Yeon's face just once.

510
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,519
No. No.

511
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:18,295
My friend is moping
because of his daughter,

512
00:29:18,319 --> 00:29:19,920
and I came here to see my love?

513
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:22,829
This is wrong.

514
00:29:23,789 --> 00:29:28,329
Yang Chi Su, you're a man
and this is not how you live.

515
00:29:32,769 --> 00:29:36,240
What's wrong with
just seeing her face?

516
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:39,686
It's not like
I'll get sweet with her...

517
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:41,785
or do anything untoward.

518
00:29:41,809 --> 00:29:43,809
Why not? Why not?

519
00:29:45,009 --> 00:29:46,880
Don't make excuses.

520
00:29:47,549 --> 00:29:49,589
If you go inside, you're a traitor.

521
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:51,420
You're a jerk.

522
00:30:00,859 --> 00:30:02,029
Darn it.

523
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,515
Sweep up outside your door!

524
00:30:08,539 --> 00:30:11,440
It's so dirty I can't stand it!

525
00:30:11,509 --> 00:30:15,140
Look at all this!
You have no conscience!

526
00:30:18,309 --> 00:30:19,309
What...

527
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:23,549
- What?
- What's so dirty?

528
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:25,750
It's way too clean.

529
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:29,406
Mom, Joon Seon bought
your favorite cream buns.

530
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:31,265
Have a bite, will you?

531
00:30:31,289 --> 00:30:34,529
Yes, Mom. Eat a little,
for my sake for going to get these.

532
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:42,315
You haven't eaten all day.

533
00:30:42,339 --> 00:30:44,240
Mom, this is really upsetting.

534
00:30:44,339 --> 00:30:46,609
She didn't starve
when we got divorced.

535
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:48,839
Mom, this is discrimination too.

536
00:30:49,579 --> 00:30:50,750
It is.

537
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:53,856
You say you love
every child the same,

538
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:56,450
but you ate after our divorces
and can't after Na Hee's?

539
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:58,519
Now I'm upset.

540
00:30:59,049 --> 00:31:00,696
- You must eat...
- My gosh!

541
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,430
Get out of here. Get out! Out!

542
00:31:04,859 --> 00:31:05,990
Mom.

543
00:31:06,829 --> 00:31:08,859
- Sleep, then.
- We'll leave.

544
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,339
- Auntie.
- Hi, Auntie.

545
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:19,686
How's your mom?
Did she eat something?

546
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:22,480
No. She just turned these down.

547
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:25,180
She can't eat something that dry.

548
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:28,420
I'll make abalone porridge.
You can have some too.

549
00:31:29,319 --> 00:31:32,349
What is Dad up to?
Is he with Mr. Yang?

550
00:31:33,119 --> 00:31:36,466
No. I think they parted ways.

551
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:37,630
Then where is he?

552
00:31:38,059 --> 00:31:39,799
Is he alone in the store?

553
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,569
My afternoon appointments
were canceled?

554
00:31:43,599 --> 00:31:47,000
- All of them?
- Yes. There was one left,

555
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:49,176
but the kid went to stay
with the mom's parents.

556
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,779
The mom just called to reschedule
the appointment for next week.

557
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:56,079
Okay.

558
00:31:56,910 --> 00:31:58,680
I get it. You can go.

559
00:31:59,079 --> 00:32:00,579
- Yes, doctor.
- Go.

560
00:32:04,119 --> 00:32:06,119
My gosh. This is not fair.

561
00:32:09,089 --> 00:32:11,059
(Father-in-law)

562
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,200
Hello, Father.

563
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:32,210
Can you...

564
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:36,319
really not get back together?

565
00:32:39,759 --> 00:32:40,795
Father.

566
00:32:40,819 --> 00:32:42,089
All married couples...

567
00:32:42,859 --> 00:32:45,759
experience a crisis or two.

568
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,759
If you try to be
a bit more understanding...

569
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:51,099
and get over that,

570
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:53,640
everything else will come easier.

571
00:32:54,339 --> 00:32:57,769
This I can guarantee
as a man who has lived more years.

572
00:33:03,109 --> 00:33:04,279
Isn't it possible?

573
00:33:06,049 --> 00:33:07,119
Even...

574
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:09,450
when I'm here...

575
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:11,819
asking you for another chance?

576
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:14,619
Father,

577
00:33:17,490 --> 00:33:18,930
since I was a kid,

578
00:33:20,259 --> 00:33:21,900
my mom was a handful.

579
00:33:22,869 --> 00:33:23,930
Actually,

580
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:27,970
if I'm being honest, I hated her.

581
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,309
Unlike other moms,

582
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,109
she was always emotional...

583
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,450
and got frustrated easily.

584
00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:42,079
But she's my mom, right?

585
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:45,920
We're related by blood,
no matter how I feel.

586
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:49,639
It's how I learned
to accept her for who she is.

587
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:54,500
But I don't think it's the same
for married couples.

588
00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:59,369
When things clash
and we go off track,

589
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,700
it's almost impossible to recover.

590
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:05,710
We haven't laughed...

591
00:34:07,079 --> 00:34:08,980
with one another for a while now.

592
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:12,480
We live under the same roof,

593
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,650
but we don't share a single laugh.

594
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:20,590
No silly jokes
are said between us either.

595
00:34:30,469 --> 00:34:32,130
We only talk when we argue.

596
00:34:39,269 --> 00:34:41,340
I'm truly sorry, Father.

597
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:47,650
I couldn't keep the promise
I made at the altar.

598
00:34:50,489 --> 00:34:52,090
I'm terribly sorry.

599
00:35:05,490 --> 00:35:07,190
I'll be in touch. Sure thing.

600
00:35:07,419 --> 00:35:08,929
(Episode 26)

601
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:12,835
Why is she thrilled
about my son being divorced?

602
00:35:12,859 --> 00:35:15,199
They just love seeing
others unhappy, don't they?

603
00:35:15,369 --> 00:35:16,699
Jerks.

604
00:35:27,039 --> 00:35:29,179
Excuse me, Ms. Choi.

605
00:35:30,149 --> 00:35:31,695
I have something to tell you.

606
00:35:31,719 --> 00:35:35,250
Go ahead although I think
I know what you're going to say.

607
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:39,520
I'm guessing I should look
for another place to work.

608
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:42,506
You won't be comfortable
seeing me anyway,

609
00:35:42,530 --> 00:35:44,659
and I don't want to walk
on eggshells around you.

610
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:47,729
Quitting is probably for the best.

611
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:50,799
Right.

612
00:35:51,939 --> 00:35:53,600
I can't disagree with you, I guess.

613
00:35:54,509 --> 00:35:56,210
Should I work
until the end of the shift...

614
00:35:56,469 --> 00:35:58,415
or stay until you hire someone else?

615
00:35:58,439 --> 00:36:01,009
It's fine. You should get going.

616
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:03,609
I'll find your replacement myself.

617
00:36:05,350 --> 00:36:08,396
Then let me stay
until the end of business today.

618
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:09,989
I said it's fine.

619
00:36:10,890 --> 00:36:13,260
I doubt I'll have
any more customers anyway.

620
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:16,430
Right.

621
00:36:17,189 --> 00:36:19,030
I'm truly sorry about this.

622
00:36:19,129 --> 00:36:22,075
What are you sorry for and why?

623
00:36:22,099 --> 00:36:24,030
It's not like
you did anything wrong.

624
00:36:24,739 --> 00:36:25,799
Still...

625
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:30,310
I feel horrible, you know.

626
00:36:31,109 --> 00:36:33,939
I feel bad for Na Hee and Gyu Jin...

627
00:36:34,109 --> 00:36:37,579
and I hate that we're ending
our relationship like this too.

628
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:41,450
I don't know how you felt,

629
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:44,319
but I loved working here with you.

630
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:50,189
Ms. Choi, don't drink
too much of the wine today,

631
00:36:50,290 --> 00:36:53,400
and please don't skip your meals
no matter how upset you are.

632
00:36:55,469 --> 00:36:58,340
Thank you for everything.

633
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:08,010
How can two sisters
be this different?

634
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:12,219
Half of each sister
would make the perfect woman.

635
00:37:13,219 --> 00:37:16,389
Where do I find a part-timer
as decent as Da Hee?

636
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,900
It'll take her some time
to find my replacement.

637
00:37:39,509 --> 00:37:40,539
Gosh.

638
00:37:41,379 --> 00:37:42,650
Ms. Song!

639
00:37:44,819 --> 00:37:46,150
Mr. Yoon.

640
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:52,689
So that happened.

641
00:37:53,819 --> 00:37:56,629
You had to quit your job too.

642
00:37:57,229 --> 00:38:00,030
Yes, this happened in the end.

643
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:05,400
I guess we're not officially
in-laws anymore.

644
00:38:06,199 --> 00:38:08,569
What should I call you
when I meet you on the streets now?

645
00:38:08,810 --> 00:38:12,039
Na Hee's my former sister-in-law,
so are you my "ex in-law" too?

646
00:38:13,039 --> 00:38:15,325
Just call me Da Hee.

647
00:38:15,349 --> 00:38:16,979
Mr. Yoon,

648
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,550
you're older than me, right?

649
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:22,849
Then will you call me...

650
00:38:23,719 --> 00:38:25,795
by my name as well?

651
00:38:25,819 --> 00:38:27,520
No, I don't think...

652
00:38:28,490 --> 00:38:30,830
I'll be able to do that.

653
00:38:31,330 --> 00:38:33,659
I don't think I'll be able...

654
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:36,030
to call you by your name either.

655
00:38:37,330 --> 00:38:38,890
Let's not call each other
anything then.

656
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,610
"Hi, it's been a while."

657
00:38:41,939 --> 00:38:43,045
We'll keep it like that.

658
00:38:43,069 --> 00:38:44,780
Sure. We'll leave out the names.

659
00:38:46,909 --> 00:38:51,050
Can you believe the things
these so-called grown-ups are doing?

660
00:38:51,219 --> 00:38:52,726
They fell in love, got married,

661
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:55,325
and brought us together
to make this one big family.

662
00:38:55,349 --> 00:38:57,250
Just how many people
are affected by this?

663
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,020
Irresponsible jerks.

664
00:38:59,419 --> 00:39:01,530
That's because
one's love for another changes.

665
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:04,060
I've been there, remember?

666
00:39:04,259 --> 00:39:06,460
My sisters and brother
have all experienced it.

667
00:39:08,569 --> 00:39:09,669
Still,

668
00:39:10,330 --> 00:39:12,770
let's stay in touch, okay?

669
00:39:13,069 --> 00:39:14,949
It's a shame to let
this friendship go to waste.

670
00:39:16,210 --> 00:39:18,509
Keep up your studies...

671
00:39:19,210 --> 00:39:21,910
and work hard on
changing your personality.

672
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,689
Here.

673
00:39:52,339 --> 00:39:55,550
I'm sorry you have to experience
this sour mood again.

674
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:57,680
Bombs keep going off, don't they?

675
00:39:58,250 --> 00:39:59,319
It's all right.

676
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:03,019
You and I were a bomb
three years ago too.

677
00:40:10,259 --> 00:40:13,100
Na Hee, are you just getting home?
Your work must've ended late.

678
00:40:13,730 --> 00:40:15,450
It's all right.
Please go back to your meal.

679
00:40:16,069 --> 00:40:17,129
Where's Mom?

680
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Na Hee, you're here.

681
00:40:21,139 --> 00:40:23,569
Your mom looks like death in there.

682
00:40:23,939 --> 00:40:26,315
I gave her some
abalone porridge to eat,

683
00:40:26,339 --> 00:40:27,949
but she wouldn't open her mouth.

684
00:40:28,779 --> 00:40:31,055
Why don't you try
and get her to eat some?

685
00:40:31,079 --> 00:40:33,550
Would she take the food
served by the one who caused this?

686
00:40:52,639 --> 00:40:53,899
Mom,

687
00:40:54,939 --> 00:40:56,139
it's me.

688
00:40:57,839 --> 00:41:00,610
I heard you didn't
eat anything today.

689
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:02,850
Can you please have
some of the porridge?

690
00:41:04,819 --> 00:41:06,519
Just hate me all you want.

691
00:41:06,819 --> 00:41:10,420
Don't hurt yourself
by skipping meals.

692
00:41:13,519 --> 00:41:14,660
Mom...

693
00:41:14,759 --> 00:41:15,889
You!

694
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:18,699
How dare you.

695
00:41:18,959 --> 00:41:22,029
How dare you do this to me!

696
00:41:24,629 --> 00:41:28,269
The others might be clueless,
but you know how I feel.

697
00:41:30,310 --> 00:41:32,086
The divorce itself is just as bad,

698
00:41:32,110 --> 00:41:35,279
but how could you
hide it from me like this?

699
00:41:36,879 --> 00:41:39,649
Do you even respect me
as your mother?

700
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,050
Do you look down on us...

701
00:41:41,079 --> 00:41:42,799
because we sell fried chicken
at the market?

702
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:45,136
Mom, that's ridiculous
and you know it.

703
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:46,360
How is it ridiculous?

704
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:50,160
Then why would you do this to me?

705
00:41:55,730 --> 00:41:57,305
I don't want to see your face,
so get out.

706
00:41:57,329 --> 00:41:59,045
I can't be bothered, so leave.

707
00:41:59,069 --> 00:42:00,639
Get out!

708
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:01,985
I told you to leave.

709
00:42:02,009 --> 00:42:03,216
- Mom?
- Get out!

710
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:05,055
Mom, don't.
You hardly have the energy.

711
00:42:05,079 --> 00:42:07,209
Just get out of here.

712
00:42:07,639 --> 00:42:11,009
Ok Boon, please calm down.
Just breathe.

713
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:12,579
Ok Ja,

714
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:15,526
just get her away from me.

715
00:42:15,550 --> 00:42:17,449
- Tell her to leave.
- Yes, of course.

716
00:42:17,490 --> 00:42:19,096
- Ga Hee, take her.
- Sure.

717
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:21,689
Na Hee, come on. Let's go outside.

718
00:42:23,889 --> 00:42:25,029
Mom...

719
00:42:25,459 --> 00:42:27,600
Joon Seon, just go.

720
00:42:28,370 --> 00:42:29,476
My gosh.

721
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:32,939
Ok Boon, just like down, okay?

722
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:36,240
Don't waste any more of your energy.

723
00:42:36,410 --> 00:42:37,939
Ok Boon, lie down.

724
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:39,339
I'm home.

725
00:42:40,379 --> 00:42:43,180
What's going on? What happened?

726
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:48,220
Serves you right
for waltzing in there.

727
00:42:48,819 --> 00:42:51,019
Would Mom want
to even look at you...

728
00:42:51,189 --> 00:42:52,819
after what you did?

729
00:42:53,259 --> 00:42:56,160
You're a sinner, you know.
You wronged her.

730
00:42:56,329 --> 00:42:58,029
I know I wronged her,

731
00:42:58,759 --> 00:43:00,730
- so stop it.
- Stop what?

732
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:03,805
Who are you to tell me
what I can and can't do?

733
00:43:03,829 --> 00:43:05,115
What gives you the right?

734
00:43:05,139 --> 00:43:07,346
Those who wronged others...

735
00:43:07,370 --> 00:43:10,370
should be too mortified
to say even a word.

736
00:43:10,709 --> 00:43:12,886
Who are you to
stand tall in front of us?

737
00:43:12,910 --> 00:43:14,156
Joon Seon, stop.

738
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:15,586
- Keep it down.
- Joon Seon,

739
00:43:15,610 --> 00:43:17,286
let's get some fresh air.

740
00:43:17,310 --> 00:43:18,620
Let go of me.

741
00:43:19,149 --> 00:43:21,850
You don't even know
what you did wrong, do you?

742
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:24,836
You have no idea
have much you've hurt...

743
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:26,336
this family and our parents.

744
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:28,629
I know. I know it all too well.

745
00:43:28,790 --> 00:43:29,966
It's killing me too, you know.

746
00:43:29,990 --> 00:43:33,206
If you did know,
you wouldn't be talking back to me!

747
00:43:33,230 --> 00:43:34,560
Joon Seon, please.

748
00:43:35,199 --> 00:43:36,470
What should I do then?

749
00:43:37,029 --> 00:43:40,200
Should I get on my knees
and await her punishment?

750
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:41,610
Is that what you want me to do?

751
00:43:42,139 --> 00:43:45,015
What about you then?
What makes you such a good son?

752
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:47,539
You drove a nail in Mom's heart too.

753
00:43:47,639 --> 00:43:49,409
You have no right to yell at me!

754
00:43:49,509 --> 00:43:51,525
Hold on.
Why would you bring that up?

755
00:43:51,549 --> 00:43:53,125
- What do you think you're doing?
- My gosh!

756
00:43:53,149 --> 00:43:54,919
- Dad?
- Dad...

757
00:43:55,889 --> 00:43:57,850
- Goodness.
- Dad, that's not it.

758
00:43:57,990 --> 00:44:01,505
Na Hee, this brat,
went in to see Mom when she...

759
00:44:01,529 --> 00:44:02,759
Shut it!

760
00:44:03,929 --> 00:44:06,059
You've got to be kidding me.

761
00:44:06,929 --> 00:44:08,846
Even the most stupid ones...

762
00:44:08,870 --> 00:44:11,299
would think twice
before raising their voices here.

763
00:44:12,370 --> 00:44:13,576
Unbelievable.

764
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:15,846
Get out. All of you, leave!

765
00:44:15,870 --> 00:44:17,745
- But Dad...
- I don't want to see any of you.

766
00:44:17,769 --> 00:44:19,409
- Dad, we're sorry.
- Get lost!

767
00:44:19,639 --> 00:44:20,779
Go!

768
00:44:21,679 --> 00:44:24,649
We don't need any one of you,
so get lost!

769
00:44:27,649 --> 00:44:29,090
My gosh.

770
00:44:31,350 --> 00:44:33,519
This is on you
and that temper of yours.

771
00:44:33,889 --> 00:44:35,659
Look what you did to us.

772
00:44:35,759 --> 00:44:37,936
How is this my fault?
It's Na Hee's fault.

773
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:39,576
Stop it already!

774
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:41,336
I can't believe
you're still arguing.

775
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:43,330
All right, fine.
There's no need to yell.

776
00:44:43,429 --> 00:44:44,629
I'm sorry about this.

777
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:47,100
We keep showing you
the worst side of us.

778
00:44:49,610 --> 00:44:50,769
So what now?

779
00:44:51,110 --> 00:44:53,316
I don't think we can go back inside
any time soon.

780
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:54,710
How about the rooftop then?

781
00:44:54,950 --> 00:44:57,149
Hold on, 3 are already up there
and there are 4 of us.

782
00:44:57,179 --> 00:44:58,320
That makes seven total.

783
00:44:58,450 --> 00:45:00,419
I guess there's room
for us to all stand around.

784
00:45:00,850 --> 00:45:01,950
Follow me.

785
00:45:02,090 --> 00:45:04,350
We'll take this chance
to do some sibling bonding.

786
00:45:05,389 --> 00:45:06,960
Where are we off to?

787
00:45:07,059 --> 00:45:09,666
Are you ignoring
my suggestion again?

788
00:45:09,690 --> 00:45:11,490
I'll tell Mom and Dad...
Hey, wait for me.

789
00:45:20,169 --> 00:45:23,909
I feel bad for our mother, you know.

790
00:45:24,110 --> 00:45:26,840
She worked her whole life
to raise us well,

791
00:45:27,409 --> 00:45:30,049
but 3 got divorced
and 1 got an annulment.

792
00:45:30,710 --> 00:45:32,620
It's not common for a parent.

793
00:45:35,789 --> 00:45:37,149
Call me the original sinner, guys.

794
00:45:37,490 --> 00:45:39,296
I'm the one who kicked things off.

795
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:41,990
Don't be like that.
I'm the worst out of us four.

796
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:45,476
I hit the wound you left behind
which made it hurt even more.

797
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:48,730
No way.
My annulment was the final straw.

798
00:45:49,470 --> 00:45:51,840
Mom was finally moving on
but I open up old wounds again.

799
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:56,216
Na Hee only hid her divorce
because of what I did.

800
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:57,686
Because Mom was still recovering.

801
00:45:57,710 --> 00:46:00,779
Don't be so annoying.
This isn't your fault at all.

802
00:46:02,549 --> 00:46:06,379
My punch was probably
the one that hurt the most.

803
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:08,919
I stabbed her in the back, didn't I?

804
00:46:10,220 --> 00:46:11,690
I'm glad you know.

805
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:13,289
Na Hee,

806
00:46:13,490 --> 00:46:15,590
let me give you some sincere advice.

807
00:46:16,059 --> 00:46:18,830
You have too much conviction
in your own decisions.

808
00:46:19,029 --> 00:46:22,100
Your thoughts and choices
could be just as wrong, you know.

809
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:24,706
When you make big decisions,

810
00:46:24,730 --> 00:46:27,169
seek advice from your siblings...

811
00:46:27,299 --> 00:46:29,210
and those around you.

812
00:46:29,809 --> 00:46:31,416
There's a reason why...

813
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:34,409
people say things
that you don't want to hear.

814
00:46:34,710 --> 00:46:38,056
Humbly let hurtful advice sink in...

815
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:40,779
and be open to other opinions.
Don't you agree?

816
00:46:40,850 --> 00:46:43,995
Isn't she the lady doctor
from "Doctors"?

817
00:46:44,019 --> 00:46:45,289
The one that got divorced.

818
00:46:45,519 --> 00:46:46,759
She is.

819
00:46:47,190 --> 00:46:49,135
Even I wouldn't be able
to stay married to her.

820
00:46:49,159 --> 00:46:51,029
A woman who stomps all over men...

821
00:46:51,129 --> 00:46:53,029
- What did you just say?
- Joon Seon!

822
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:55,245
She wouldn't even
marry a punk like you,

823
00:46:55,269 --> 00:46:57,145
so who are you to
talk smack about my sister?

824
00:46:57,169 --> 00:46:59,046
- Joon Seon, stop.
- Gosh, we're sorry.

825
00:46:59,070 --> 00:47:01,940
We're just in a terrible mood,
you see.

826
00:47:02,039 --> 00:47:03,285
Stop it.

827
00:47:03,309 --> 00:47:05,110
Aren't we entitled to free speech?

828
00:47:05,610 --> 00:47:08,509
Like sister, like brother.
What a family of thugs.

829
00:47:09,779 --> 00:47:10,950
What?

830
00:47:11,149 --> 00:47:13,980
- What did you just say? A thug?
- Ga Hee, please.

831
00:47:14,179 --> 00:47:17,025
Who are you to say that
about my siblings?

832
00:47:17,049 --> 00:47:18,966
I'm the thug in the family,
you know.

833
00:47:18,990 --> 00:47:20,566
Want a taste of this?

834
00:47:20,590 --> 00:47:22,166
Ga Hee, not you too.

835
00:47:22,190 --> 00:47:23,505
Na Hee, please.

836
00:47:23,529 --> 00:47:25,129
Just punch him, Ga Hee.

837
00:47:25,529 --> 00:47:27,629
I'll take care of the rest,
so do as you wish.

838
00:47:28,259 --> 00:47:31,076
Did you hear that?
My sister gave me the go-ahead.

839
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:32,115
You're dead meat today.

840
00:47:32,139 --> 00:47:34,500
She's notorious
for knocking out people's teeth.

841
00:47:34,539 --> 00:47:35,785
Ga Hee, no.

842
00:47:35,809 --> 00:47:38,655
- What the...
- Ga Hee, please don't.

843
00:47:38,679 --> 00:47:40,086
- Don't do this.
- Get over here.

844
00:47:40,110 --> 00:47:41,379
I dare you to say it again!

845
00:47:51,620 --> 00:47:54,019
Why aren't you sleeping?

846
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:55,590
Is it still keeping you up?

847
00:47:58,159 --> 00:47:59,299
Ok Boon,

848
00:47:59,730 --> 00:48:02,000
let me get you a glass of water.

849
00:48:03,769 --> 00:48:04,970
Honey.

850
00:48:08,669 --> 00:48:10,210
Right, of course.

851
00:48:11,070 --> 00:48:12,610
I know how you feel.

852
00:48:13,710 --> 00:48:17,480
I don't think
I have it in me this time...

853
00:48:18,179 --> 00:48:20,919
to share words of wisdom
like I normally do.

854
00:48:21,919 --> 00:48:23,320
What can we do though?

855
00:48:23,490 --> 00:48:25,860
It's not like we can do anything
to get them back together.

856
00:48:30,230 --> 00:48:31,529
Honey...

857
00:48:32,799 --> 00:48:35,970
Let's just think of this
as our fate.

858
00:48:36,470 --> 00:48:39,299
I mean, what else can we do?

859
00:48:42,309 --> 00:48:44,539
Honey, why is it always me?

860
00:48:46,409 --> 00:48:49,480
Why only our children?

861
00:48:52,350 --> 00:48:54,049
I had no idea...

862
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:58,419
that Na Hee of all people
would betray us like this.

863
00:49:01,659 --> 00:49:05,730
This is so unfair.
What did I do to deserve this?

864
00:49:06,399 --> 00:49:09,830
What am I supposed to do now?

865
00:49:10,230 --> 00:49:13,299
Honey, I don't know
if I can keep going.

866
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:15,240
My gosh.

867
00:49:15,409 --> 00:49:16,710
Honey...

868
00:49:22,950 --> 00:49:25,279
That's it. Let all the tears flow.

869
00:49:25,879 --> 00:49:28,049
Think of this as
the last day you'll cry.

870
00:49:28,690 --> 00:49:31,889
And tomorrow, we'll close up
the store for a day...

871
00:49:32,289 --> 00:49:33,720
and get some fresh air.

872
00:49:34,159 --> 00:49:36,330
I'll buy you crab, your favorite.

873
00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:37,929
That's it.

874
00:49:38,330 --> 00:49:39,629
Let it all out.

875
00:49:45,539 --> 00:49:48,200
Oh, dear.

876
00:50:21,669 --> 00:50:24,370
Dad, you're up early.

877
00:50:25,210 --> 00:50:26,309
We spent a long time...

878
00:50:26,679 --> 00:50:28,850
serving out our punishment
outside last night.

879
00:50:29,279 --> 00:50:30,679
I didn't ask.

880
00:50:31,450 --> 00:50:34,179
Well... In case you're wondering.

881
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:37,120
Where's Mom? Is she still asleep?

882
00:50:37,990 --> 00:50:39,820
She left home.

883
00:50:40,190 --> 00:50:41,190
What?

884
00:50:41,559 --> 00:50:44,129
Your mom ran away from home.

885
00:50:44,629 --> 00:50:47,000
What? She ran away?

886
00:50:55,139 --> 00:50:57,385
What now? What's wrong?

887
00:50:57,409 --> 00:50:58,740
Mom is gone.

888
00:50:58,909 --> 00:50:59,886
What?

889
00:50:59,910 --> 00:51:02,586
Mom ran away from home.
When Dad woke up, she was gone.

890
00:51:02,610 --> 00:51:05,779
Hey, wait. I'll drive you there.
You can't go there without the car.

891
00:51:06,179 --> 00:51:08,919
Forget it.
It has nothing to do with you now.

892
00:51:18,029 --> 00:51:20,330
I see. So she's not there?

893
00:51:22,029 --> 00:51:24,500
Yes. Her phone is turned off.

894
00:51:25,799 --> 00:51:26,799
Yes.

895
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:30,216
If you get a call from my mom,

896
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:31,980
could you please let us know?

897
00:51:33,009 --> 00:51:35,379
Yes. Thank you. Bye.

898
00:51:36,710 --> 00:51:38,210
She's not at the playground.

899
00:51:38,919 --> 00:51:40,625
What about the park
near the community center?

900
00:51:40,649 --> 00:51:42,990
She's not there.
I looked there already.

901
00:51:43,049 --> 00:51:46,419
Gosh, where did she go
without saying anything?

902
00:51:46,620 --> 00:51:49,066
Let's look for her a little more.
Follow me.

903
00:51:49,090 --> 00:51:51,635
(Mapo Seolleongtang)

904
00:51:51,659 --> 00:51:53,600
She's not at Ms. Yeong Sun's either.

905
00:51:54,330 --> 00:51:55,529
And Mom didn't call her.

906
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,470
It's the weekend,
so their store isn't even open yet.

907
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:03,840
I have no idea where she is.

908
00:52:07,610 --> 00:52:10,509
Hang on, Ga Hee.

909
00:52:21,259 --> 00:52:23,289
Aren't you even worried?

910
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:27,660
How can you be frying chicken now?
I'm worried sick about her.

911
00:52:27,859 --> 00:52:29,630
We still have to work.

912
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:33,170
We can't make a habit of randomly
closing a small store like ours.

913
00:52:38,170 --> 00:52:39,440
Don't worry, Ok Ja.

914
00:52:39,910 --> 00:52:42,049
I'm sure she will come back
after getting some air.

915
00:52:42,650 --> 00:52:44,910
It's not her first time
to run away like this.

916
00:52:44,980 --> 00:52:48,555
Back when Da Hee caused trouble,
she came back after half a day.

917
00:52:48,579 --> 00:52:51,750
Things are not the same now.
This is a lot more serious.

918
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:56,759
Both you and I know
what Na Hee means to her.

919
00:52:57,660 --> 00:53:00,759
Na Hee was her only pride
when people gossiped at the market.

920
00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:03,400
"I still have my Na Hee."

921
00:53:04,670 --> 00:53:05,900
That's how she held out.

922
00:53:07,569 --> 00:53:09,710
She must be devastated now.

923
00:53:11,910 --> 00:53:16,180
Ok Boon, where are you now? Ok Boon.

924
00:53:17,579 --> 00:53:19,755
Young Dal, do you think...

925
00:53:19,779 --> 00:53:23,289
Hey, that's enough.
Stop crying, Ok Ja.

926
00:53:25,150 --> 00:53:29,765
I just have bad feelings about this,
Young Dal.

927
00:53:29,789 --> 00:53:32,400
Why don't you call her again?

928
00:53:37,730 --> 00:53:41,400
Ok Boon is practically
like a mother to me.

929
00:53:42,839 --> 00:53:45,369
I can't live without her.

930
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:50,779
Ok Boon, where are you now?

931
00:53:51,509 --> 00:53:52,650
Ok Boon.

932
00:53:53,450 --> 00:53:56,349
Gosh, where on earth did she go?

933
00:54:08,029 --> 00:54:09,799
Wasn't that hilarious?

934
00:54:11,670 --> 00:54:14,170
Gosh this is so pretty.

935
00:54:42,529 --> 00:54:43,529
Mom.

936
00:55:03,490 --> 00:55:04,549
Where are you going?

937
00:55:04,819 --> 00:55:06,259
I'll be in my room.

938
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:14,660
Where's Na Hee?
Is she still on Ganghwa Island?

939
00:55:15,029 --> 00:55:17,045
No. She said she left.

940
00:55:17,069 --> 00:55:18,730
I guess she's on her way home.

941
00:55:19,099 --> 00:55:20,946
This won't do.
I will go to the police...

942
00:55:20,970 --> 00:55:22,240
and report her missing.

943
00:55:22,339 --> 00:55:23,916
I don't feel good about this.
I'm worried.

944
00:55:23,940 --> 00:55:25,345
What are you talking about?

945
00:55:25,369 --> 00:55:27,856
It's been less than a day.
We should wait a little more.

946
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:29,426
For how long?

947
00:55:29,450 --> 00:55:31,285
What if something happens to her
while we wait?

948
00:55:31,309 --> 00:55:32,549
What will you do then?

949
00:55:32,579 --> 00:55:33,680
I can't wait any longer.

950
00:55:33,750 --> 00:55:35,420
You go ahead
and wait for her calmly.

951
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:37,420
- Gosh.
- That punk.

952
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:48,200
Mom?

953
00:55:49,369 --> 00:55:51,369
Mom. Mom!

954
00:55:51,769 --> 00:55:55,075
Mom, where have you been?
I've been worried about you.

955
00:55:55,099 --> 00:55:57,339
Why are you being like this?
Get off me. I can't breathe.

956
00:55:58,140 --> 00:56:01,140
I thought you jumped
into the river or something.

957
00:56:01,339 --> 00:56:04,309
I was on my way to the police
to report your missing.

958
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:08,150
I don't want you to worry me
like that ever again.

959
00:56:08,420 --> 00:56:09,750
Promise me, okay?

960
00:56:10,349 --> 00:56:11,720
So where have you been?

961
00:56:12,490 --> 00:56:14,359
It's not like you know all places.

962
00:56:14,819 --> 00:56:17,466
I don't know. I don't care.

963
00:56:17,490 --> 00:56:18,936
I'm just glad that you're safe.

964
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:22,869
Don't be silly.
Why are you whining like that?

965
00:56:25,769 --> 00:56:27,769
- Mom.
- Mom!

966
00:56:28,099 --> 00:56:30,886
Mom, we've been
worried sick about you.

967
00:56:30,910 --> 00:56:33,116
We called all your friends.

968
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:36,186
Na Hee even went
to Ms. Yeong Sun's restaurant.

969
00:56:36,210 --> 00:56:38,926
Thank you so much
for coming back safe and sound, Mom.

970
00:56:38,950 --> 00:56:40,626
- Mom.
- Mom.

971
00:56:40,650 --> 00:56:43,990
Gosh, get off me. Don't overreact.

972
00:56:44,990 --> 00:56:46,019
You're back.

973
00:56:48,059 --> 00:56:50,490
Yes, I'm back.

974
00:56:51,660 --> 00:56:53,936
Good. Go get some rest then.

975
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:55,930
You must be tired
from walking around all day.

976
00:57:00,039 --> 00:57:02,116
Mom, did you eat anything?

977
00:57:02,140 --> 00:57:03,585
Do you want some abalone porridge?

978
00:57:03,609 --> 00:57:05,386
Heat up some porridge.
I doubt she ate anything.

979
00:57:05,410 --> 00:57:07,839
- I'll go heat it up.
- Let me help you.

980
00:57:08,309 --> 00:57:11,750
So where did you go today?

981
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:13,849
I wanted to go with you,
but you left me out.

982
00:57:14,579 --> 00:57:18,589
The beach on Ganghwa Island.
Na Hee took me there before.

983
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:22,220
You went quite a long way.

984
00:57:23,029 --> 00:57:24,430
I bet you liked it a lot.

985
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,529
It was nice that day.

986
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:30,630
But now that I think of it,

987
00:57:31,799 --> 00:57:34,400
she took me there because
she wanted to tell me something.

988
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,640
She wanted to tell me the truth.

989
00:57:41,740 --> 00:57:42,750
Are you tired?

990
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:46,156
Yes, I'm tired. I'll get some sleep.

991
00:57:46,180 --> 00:57:47,619
Go ahead and sleep.

992
00:57:54,660 --> 00:57:56,160
Sleep well.

993
00:58:03,670 --> 00:58:06,146
So where did she go, Dad?

994
00:58:06,170 --> 00:58:07,400
Who did she meet?

995
00:58:07,940 --> 00:58:11,369
You don't have to know everything.
She's back and that's that.

996
00:58:11,410 --> 00:58:12,509
I still want to know.

997
00:58:12,609 --> 00:58:13,740
Is she asleep?

998
00:58:15,380 --> 00:58:17,980
She wants to sleep.
Don't bother her.

999
00:58:21,119 --> 00:58:22,966
Is she sleeping?
I heated up the porridge.

1000
00:58:22,990 --> 00:58:24,490
Save it for later.

1001
00:58:24,990 --> 00:58:27,160
I'm going to
the merchant association office.

1002
00:58:27,289 --> 00:58:29,859
Don't wake her up. Okay?

1003
00:58:30,029 --> 00:58:31,089
- Yes.
- Yes.

1004
00:58:32,259 --> 00:58:33,599
- See you.
- Bye.

1005
00:58:34,599 --> 00:58:36,900
Really? Is she asleep now?

1006
00:58:41,039 --> 00:58:43,140
Where has she been?

1007
00:58:45,980 --> 00:58:47,009
Okay.

1008
00:58:47,609 --> 00:58:49,950
Ga Hee, take good care of her.

1009
00:58:50,680 --> 00:58:53,950
All right. Okay. Bye.

1010
00:59:20,609 --> 00:59:21,710
Hello, Na Hee.

1011
00:59:22,650 --> 00:59:24,426
Hyun Gyung, where are you?

1012
00:59:24,450 --> 00:59:27,119
I just finished work.
I had a make-up lesson to do.

1013
00:59:27,650 --> 00:59:29,849
I haven't eaten all day.

1014
00:59:30,589 --> 00:59:32,190
Will you eat with me?

1015
00:59:38,859 --> 00:59:40,900
Go ahead and eat.
You must be hungry.

1016
00:59:43,430 --> 00:59:46,839
I'm sorry, Hyun Gyung.
I know you should go home.

1017
00:59:46,940 --> 00:59:49,839
I called home already.
Seo Jin is asleep.

1018
00:59:50,309 --> 00:59:51,769
Seo Young takes good care of her.

1019
01:00:24,970 --> 01:00:26,839
Why aren't you asking anything?

1020
01:00:27,980 --> 01:00:29,785
You must've heard the whole thing.

1021
01:00:29,809 --> 01:00:31,950
I want to let you eat first.

1022
01:00:33,279 --> 01:00:35,019
Does that sound too much like a mom?

1023
01:00:49,970 --> 01:00:51,569
You'll get sick if you do that.

1024
01:00:52,670 --> 01:00:55,640
Do just one thing. Eat or cry.

1025
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:08,150
Good for you.

1026
01:01:09,019 --> 01:01:10,220
Cry first, then eat.

1027
01:01:11,789 --> 01:01:14,089
If you eat then cry,
you'll get hungry again.

1028
01:01:20,630 --> 01:01:21,759
Bear with it.

1029
01:01:22,359 --> 01:01:24,000
You have no other choice.

1030
01:01:25,569 --> 01:01:27,339
You made the decision.

1031
01:01:31,309 --> 01:01:32,740
It was my decision,

1032
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:36,250
so I can deal with my pain.

1033
01:01:40,319 --> 01:01:43,250
But the pain that my decision
caused Mom and Dad...

1034
01:01:48,819 --> 01:01:50,690
That's too hard to bear.

1035
01:01:51,430 --> 01:01:52,900
Time is...

1036
01:01:55,460 --> 01:01:57,170
Time is too slow.

1037
01:02:07,079 --> 01:02:08,410
How delicious.

1038
01:02:08,809 --> 01:02:11,279
It's full of red bean
from head to tail.

1039
01:02:17,890 --> 01:02:19,619
- Mr. Song!
- My goodness.

1040
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:21,896
What were you thinking about...

1041
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:23,765
that you didn't even see me coming?

1042
01:02:23,789 --> 01:02:25,206
Were you out somewhere?

1043
01:02:25,230 --> 01:02:27,799
Yes, taking care of things
at the office.

1044
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:29,599
What about you?

1045
01:02:29,799 --> 01:02:31,646
I took out the trash...

1046
01:02:31,670 --> 01:02:34,200
and the fish-shaped bun lady
gave me some leftovers.

1047
01:02:35,500 --> 01:02:38,539
- Do you want one?
- No. I don't feel well.

1048
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:41,640
Something must be bothering you.

1049
01:02:42,779 --> 01:02:44,150
Goodbye, then.

1050
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:48,980
Go on ahead.

1051
01:02:51,349 --> 01:02:52,390
Mr. Song.

1052
01:02:54,619 --> 01:02:56,029
Do you have a few dollar bills?

1053
01:02:56,329 --> 01:02:57,589
Dollar bills?

1054
01:02:58,259 --> 01:02:59,500
How many?

1055
01:03:01,829 --> 01:03:03,670
This is the best when you're upset.

1056
01:03:04,529 --> 01:03:08,000
Sing a few songs like crazy
and you'll feel better.

1057
01:03:08,140 --> 01:03:09,970
It's just a temporary measure,

1058
01:03:10,140 --> 01:03:12,680
but it's 4 songs for a dollar,
so let's just sing 4.

1059
01:03:13,180 --> 01:03:16,809
I'll be in the booth way over there.

1060
01:03:16,950 --> 01:03:19,109
Don't worry about
my overhearing you.

1061
01:03:19,880 --> 01:03:21,079
Here you go.

1062
01:03:23,250 --> 01:03:25,519
No, I... Ma'am.

1063
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:27,920
- Where is it?
- Over there.

1064
01:03:28,359 --> 01:03:32,106
I look around, wondering what to do

1065
01:03:32,130 --> 01:03:38,069
But all I see are people
with their backs to me

1066
01:03:40,569 --> 01:03:44,170
Let's all go

1067
01:03:44,269 --> 01:03:48,555
To the East Sea

1068
01:03:48,579 --> 01:03:54,426
Who is throwing rocks
and bruising me?

1069
01:03:54,450 --> 01:03:57,525
Who is it?

1070
01:03:57,549 --> 01:04:02,589
Who is making my poor heart cry?

1071
01:04:03,460 --> 01:04:08,329
- Who is it?
- To the East Sea

1072
01:04:12,670 --> 01:04:14,599
Why are you filling your own glass?

1073
01:04:14,799 --> 01:04:16,369
It's fine.

1074
01:04:17,670 --> 01:04:19,140
I'm used to pouring,

1075
01:04:19,609 --> 01:04:21,740
but not to others pouring for me.

1076
01:04:22,380 --> 01:04:23,480
How do you feel?

1077
01:04:23,750 --> 01:04:25,926
Didn't the shouting
make you feel better?

1078
01:04:25,950 --> 01:04:29,589
Well, I guess it worked a bit.

1079
01:04:34,759 --> 01:04:37,390
You should eat as well.

1080
01:04:37,859 --> 01:04:41,059
If you just drink,
you'll be too sick to work tomorrow.

1081
01:04:41,529 --> 01:04:43,269
- Here. Eat this.
- Thanks.

1082
01:04:49,670 --> 01:04:51,509
The fish-shaped bun lady said...

1083
01:04:52,269 --> 01:04:54,515
she uses the same batter...

1084
01:04:54,539 --> 01:04:56,450
and same red beans to make them,

1085
01:04:56,609 --> 01:04:59,109
but some cook well and some burn.

1086
01:04:59,549 --> 01:05:01,250
She's never completely pleased.

1087
01:05:02,420 --> 01:05:05,349
Even buns from
the same batch are like that.

1088
01:05:06,759 --> 01:05:10,359
Kids from the same parents
would be like that too.

1089
01:05:10,990 --> 01:05:12,660
You never get your way with them.

1090
01:05:13,299 --> 01:05:15,099
Don't be too upset.

1091
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:19,470
Everyone is talking about
our family, right?

1092
01:05:19,500 --> 01:05:21,200
I can't deny that.

1093
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:23,970
But it's so strange.

1094
01:05:24,839 --> 01:05:28,680
Why is it so exciting to talk about
someone else's misfortunes?

1095
01:05:29,779 --> 01:05:32,710
It can't be because
we're all bad people, right?

1096
01:05:33,819 --> 01:05:36,079
It's because it's not their problem.

1097
01:05:38,990 --> 01:05:41,789
I don't have any kids,

1098
01:05:42,660 --> 01:05:45,490
so I don't know half of
what you're going through.

1099
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:47,636
But when I'm upset,

1100
01:05:47,660 --> 01:05:50,000
I think of the worst outcome.

1101
01:05:50,700 --> 01:05:54,869
I could fall down a manhole
and break a leg,

1102
01:05:55,170 --> 01:05:58,509
or I could die alone in my room
without anyone knowing,

1103
01:05:58,569 --> 01:06:00,880
and my body would rot away.

1104
01:06:01,509 --> 01:06:03,950
Why would you think of
such dreadful things?

1105
01:06:04,650 --> 01:06:07,680
Compared to those situations,
the rest is nothing.

1106
01:06:10,220 --> 01:06:12,990
So what if your kids are divorced?

1107
01:06:13,619 --> 01:06:15,765
Pretend they were never married.

1108
01:06:15,789 --> 01:06:18,390
Isn't it better than them
dying of something dreadful?

1109
01:06:18,690 --> 01:06:19,829
Maybe.

1110
01:06:20,299 --> 01:06:23,569
I'm okay, but my wife is half-dead.

1111
01:06:23,769 --> 01:06:26,029
You're not okay either.

1112
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:28,599
Don't pretend to be okay.

1113
01:06:30,140 --> 01:06:31,369
Your heart will suffer.

1114
01:06:32,710 --> 01:06:35,509
Vent it by singing,

1115
01:06:36,349 --> 01:06:39,579
or by drinking,
and don't keep it inside.

1116
01:06:39,750 --> 01:06:41,849
Then start again tomorrow.

1117
01:06:42,349 --> 01:06:43,519
What's more to life?

1118
01:06:45,450 --> 01:06:49,059
You sound like
you lived longer than I have.

1119
01:06:50,359 --> 01:06:53,630
I tried to lecture
someone older, didn't I?

1120
01:06:53,859 --> 01:06:54,859
Sorry.

1121
01:07:09,109 --> 01:07:11,349
(Mr. Song Young Dal)

1122
01:07:18,650 --> 01:07:20,390
Yes, Dad.

1123
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:40,779
Dad.

1124
01:07:41,380 --> 01:07:42,640
You're here.

1125
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:44,680
You drink instant coffee, right?

1126
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:57,559
You can talk, Dad.

1127
01:07:58,529 --> 01:08:01,099
Drink before it gets cold.

1128
01:08:02,559 --> 01:08:03,930
Just talk.

1129
01:08:04,170 --> 01:08:06,470
You called me to say something.

1130
01:08:12,670 --> 01:08:13,740
You should...

1131
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:16,009
come home.

1132
01:08:17,880 --> 01:08:18,980
What?

1133
01:08:19,380 --> 01:08:22,519
Pack up and move back home.

1134
01:08:47,380 --> 01:08:49,809
(Once Again)

1135
01:08:50,250 --> 01:08:53,250
I'm moving back home.
Dad told me to.

1136
01:08:54,849 --> 01:08:56,019
Yoon Gyu Jin.

1137
01:08:56,450 --> 01:08:58,890
It must've been tough
living with me.

1138
01:08:59,019 --> 01:09:00,289
I was sorry.

1139
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:02,119
And thank you.

1140
01:09:02,359 --> 01:09:03,890
Let's eat out as a family.

1141
01:09:04,029 --> 01:09:06,329
You won't go back on your word,
will you?

1142
01:09:09,799 --> 01:09:11,430
Keep trying to get close to her.

1143
01:09:12,029 --> 01:09:13,515
That's all you can do now.

1144
01:09:13,539 --> 01:09:15,070
Let go. You're being a nuisance.

1145
01:09:15,170 --> 01:09:16,809
Na Hee must feel so embarrassed.

1146
01:09:16,869 --> 01:09:18,885
Mom doesn't even answer.

1147
01:09:18,909 --> 01:09:21,440
Should we help them make amends?

1148
01:09:21,780 --> 01:09:22,816
What's that?

1149
01:09:22,840 --> 01:09:24,579
My gosh. Isn't that Mom?
