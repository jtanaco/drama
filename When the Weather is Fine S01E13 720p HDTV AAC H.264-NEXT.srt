<b>Gosh, I never liked that girl.</b>

160
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:02,380
<b>That sneaky girl.</b>

161
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,650
<b>Gosh, how dare she?</b>

162
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:07,480
<b>No, never.</b>

163
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:11,190
<b>- What? - I never got in your way.</b>

164
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:12,750
<b>Not even once.</b>

165
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:16,660
<b>You never made a move on him deliberately,</b>

166
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:19,460
<b>knowing that I had a crush on him?</b>

167
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:20,820
<b>No, never.</b>

168
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:24,630
<b>I speculated that you probably liked him,</b>

169
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:27,060
<b>but I didn't know that Eun Seop was your crush.</b>

170
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:29,600
<b>You know what?</b>

171
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:33,100
<b>I have a crush on someone.</b>

172
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,450
<b>I like him so much!</b>

173
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,110
<b>Never.</b>

174
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,350
<b>That's why I can't understand you at all.</b>

175
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,050
<b>Why would you become so mean because of me?</b>

176
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,050
<b>Bo Yeong.</b>

177
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:59,970
<b>What made you so twisted?</b>

178
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:15,540
<b>Yes.</b>

179
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:17,990
<b>I found her.</b>

180
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:22,250
<b>No, don't worry. I'll bring her down.</b>

181
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:23,930
<b>Okay.</b>

182
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:32,400
<b>Follow me, and don't fall behind.</b>

183
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:08,830
<b>Out of the way.</b>

184
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:11,000
<b>Move out of the way, everyone!</b>

185
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,040
<b>What?</b>

186
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:23,340
<b>Do you need anything?</b>

187
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:25,220
<b>Just tell me the terms of the deal.</b>

188
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:28,390
<b>Oh, right. I was supposed to tell you that.</b>

189
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,090
<b>What? You don't like it?</b>

190
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:41,670
<b>- No. - Then you don't have to come.</b>

191
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,260
<b>Who cares about book clubs anyway?</b>

192
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,270
<b>Fine.</b>

193
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:18,360
<b>You're early.</b>

194
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:24,340
<b>Thank you.</b>

195
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:34,350
<b>I hear you're seeing Shim Myeong Yeo these days.</b>

196
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,160
<b>Yes.</b>

197
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:41,730
<b>And she's holed up in the woods somewhere in Gangwon Province?</b>

198
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:50,470
<b>You know, I want you to focus on me...</b>

199
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:52,910
<b>whether it's as a writer...</b>

200
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:54,910
<b>or as a woman.</b>

201
00:20:56,570 --> 00:20:59,340
<b>- What? - I want you to stop seeing her.</b>

202
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:02,750
<b>I'm not telling you not to publish her book.</b>

203
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:05,040
<b>Her book will be published...</b>

204
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,920
<b>whether you see her or not.</b>

205
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:09,250
<b>So just publish her book...</b>

206
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:10,820
<b>without seeing her.</b>

207
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:13,930
<b>Okay? Can you do that?</b>

208
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:18,560
<b>It's all true, Yun Taek.</b>

209
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,970
<b>- Can I get some water, please? - Coming up.</b>

210
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:25,060
<b>What do you mean?</b>

211
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,070
<b>And they say I'm the next Shim Myeong Yeo?</b>

212
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,250
<b>Unbelievable.</b>

213
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,450
<b>What does she have that I don't?</b>

214
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:34,920
<b>Is my writing not as good as hers?</b>

215
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,250
<b>Am I not as good-looking as she is?</b>

216
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:39,110
<b>Fine, she was born earlier, I'll give her that.</b>

217
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:42,430
<b>Have you even heard the rumors?</b>

218
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:45,020
<b>You haven't?</b>

219
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:47,550
<b>At the peak of her career,</b>

220
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:50,060
<b>she suddenly quit writing and went back to her hometown.</b>

221
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:52,970
<b>What did they say?</b>

222
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:55,440
<b>Everything people say about me is true.</b>

223
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,440
<b>Right.</b>

224
00:21:56,670 --> 00:21:57,910
<b>That's the truth.</b>

225
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:04,000
<b>They say she had a fling with her brother-in-law,</b>

226
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:08,180
<b>and that's why her sister killed her husband.</b>

227
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:12,190
<b>Believe what they say.</b>

228
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:18,820
<b>So you didn't know?</b>

229
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:23,900
<b>Then why did you two break up?</b>

230
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,320
<b>Gosh, it's hot.</b>

231
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:29,800
<b>Excuse me. I asked for water, not broth.</b>

232
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:31,030
<b>Okay.</b>

233
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:32,600
<b>Cha Yun Taek.</b>

234
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:35,380
<b>Cha...</b>

235
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:38,840
<b>Myeong Yeo!</b>

236
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:40,650
<b>Myeong Yeo!</b>

237
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:44,920
<b>Answer me.</b>

238
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:48,110
<b>You're very persistent.</b>

239
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,320
<b>Just tell me the reason.</b>

240
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:52,850
<b>Is that so hard?</b>

241
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,520
<b>Yun Taek.</b>

242
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,320
<b>Have a good life.</b>

243
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,740
<b>Have a good life.</b>

244
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:03,300
<b>Get married like you've always wanted,</b>

245
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,530
<b>have kids like you've always dreamed of,</b>

246
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:06,680
<b>and live happily ever after.</b>

247
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:10,100
<b>Myeong Yeo.</b>

248
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:14,010
<b>Please be happy. Forget an idiot like me, okay?</b>

249
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,310
<b>Myeong Yeo.</b>

250
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:18,810
<b>Let go!</b>

251
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:28,200
<b>I'm going to do everything with you.</b>

252
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:35,400
<b>I'm going to do everything with you.</b>

253
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,500
<b>Like this.</b>

254
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:07,530
<b>I'm...</b>

255
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,030
<b>not.</b>

256
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:32,230
<b>Everything people say about me is true.</b>

257
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:33,930
<b>That's the truth.</b>

258
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:38,000
<b>Believe what they say.</b>

259
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:16,750
<b>- Hae Won. - You woke up?</b>

260
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:17,750
<b>Yes.</b>

261
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:21,160
<b>Are you feeling okay?</b>

262
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,620
<b>You didn't catch a cold or anything?</b>

263
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:23,890
<b>No, I didn't.</b>

264
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:25,590
<b>How are you?</b>

265
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:26,960
<b>I'm good.</b>

266
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,730
<b>Did you talk to...</b>

267
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,440
<b>- Did it... - It went well.</b>

268
00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:35,900
<b>That's great.</b>

269
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:44,180
<b>What? Don't tell me you're sleepy again.</b>

270
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:45,650
<b>I am.</b>

271
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:50,350
<b>I thought you had insomnia. Or was it mythomania?</b>

272
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:52,290
<b>- I do. - You have mythomania?</b>

273
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:54,190
<b>No, I have insomnia.</b>

274
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:00,700
<b>No, you can't fall asleep now. Get up.</b>

275
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:02,200
<b>- Hae Won. - What?</b>

276
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,570
<b>Let me take a short nap.</b>

277
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:04,970
<b>What short nap?</b>

278
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:07,070
<b>You slept all this time. Get up already.</b>

279
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:08,870
<b>I'm bored. Come on.</b>

280
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:09,940
<b>What?</b>

281
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:11,370
<b>Hey.</b>

282
00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:13,680
<b>Hey.</b>

283
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,580
<b>- Get up. - What?</b>

284
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:18,150
<b>My eyes.</b>

285
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,150
<b>Come on, get up.</b>

286
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:23,990
<b>Get up. Come on, get up.</b>

287
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:25,920
<b>- Hey. - Get up.</b>

288
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,120
<b>I'm going to make you into the Joker.</b>

289
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,790
<b>Okay, I'll get up.</b>

290
00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:33,000
<b>Hey, no! Get up.</b>

291
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,960
<b>You're really not going to get up? Come on.</b>

292
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,700
<b>Hey! Get up.</b>

293
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:43,070
<b>Oh, boy.</b>

294
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:46,010
<b>- Hello, Eun Sil. - What?</b>

295
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:49,010
<b>- What a very casual entrance. - Wasn't it?</b>

296
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:52,580
<b>Gosh, our timing is finally right for a change.</b>

297
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:53,650
<b>I know.</b>

298
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,420
<b>Look at those roses.</b>

299
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:01,790
<b>Hey. Aren't these...</b>

300
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:04,360
<b>the same ones you gave me a long time ago?</b>

301
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:05,930
<b>What?</b>

302
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,260
<b>What...</b>

303
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:11,730
<b>Are you asking me out like this?</b>

304
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:13,140
<b>Yes.</b>

305
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:16,170
<b>I'm Lee Jang Woo, the student body president.</b>

306
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:19,270
<b>- I know that you're Lee Jang Woo. - You know me?</b>

307
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,480
<b>Those roses are white.</b>

308
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:25,980
<b>You must be very kind and innocent, right?</b>

309
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:27,050
<b>Yes, I am.</b>

310
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:29,220
<b>But that's too bad.</b>

311
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:33,290
<b>Baek Gyeong asked me out during lunch earlier today.</b>

312
00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:34,990
<b>And I said yes.</b>

313
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,360
<b>What?</b>

314
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:37,930
<b>Sorry.</b>

315
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:42,130
<b>- I guess our timing didn't match. - Timing?</b>

316
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:46,230
<b>- What is that? - It's nothing.</b>

317
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,240
<b>- Can I read it? - No, you can't. Why?</b>

318
