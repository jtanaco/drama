1
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:38,910
RUGAL

2
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:50,530
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, RELIGION AND INCIDENTS

3
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:52,950
PORTRAYED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

4
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:55,320
-Hurry!
-Quick!

5
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:11,380
I WAS KILLED BY
THE SICK MURDERER KANG GI-BEOM

6
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:45,930
-Gwang-cheol, Mi-na.
-My goodness.

7
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:56,030
EPISODE 9

8
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:02,620
We'll lie low for the time being.

9
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,490
And we'll move separately.

10
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:07,540
-Got it.
-Gi-beom, get some rest.

11
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,920
Okay.

12
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:30,940
Okay, I caught you.

13
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:36,860
-What's going on?
-67H 2661.

14
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:40,400
They're shoving a body bag into this van.
We have to catch these punks.

15
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:42,360
Maybe they'll hang it somewhere else.

16
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:44,910
-What's the location?
-2661...

17
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:46,790
I'll track them and let you know.

18
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:48,290
Let's go.

19
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:50,120
We just got here and have to go back out.

20
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,000
Wait, hold on.

21
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:53,880
There are a bunch of them.

22
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:55,670
According to the movements...

23
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:58,590
One, two. No, there are three.

24
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:00,930
It looks like something's going on
at the park too.

25
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:02,510
We'll split up and track them down.

26
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,300
Once you find it, move on to the next.

27
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,560
And just return when we're done, right?

28
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,600
Mi-na, you should stay.

29
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:09,180
Why?

30
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:11,310
Gi-beom must be confused.

31
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:12,690
Stay and look after him.

32
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,230
Okay.

33
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:39,800
I WAS KILLED BY
THE SICK MURDERER KANG GI-BEOM

34
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:49,600
Enough.
How many times do I have to see it?

35
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,390
<i>All the data from the scenes</i>

36
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:54,190
<i>of important cases must be
played repeatedly and saved.</i>

37
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:56,480
Fine. Do whatever you want.

38
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,320
<i>Data saved.</i>

39
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:06,870
<i>All of us are still shaken up
by the recent attack at the park,</i>

40
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:10,740
<i>and another gruesome incident
took place this morning.</i>

41
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,660
<i>A sign with the name of the perpetrator</i>

42
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:15,460
<i>was found at the scene,
which is very unusual.</i>

43
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,790
<i>However, the person is deceased,</i>

44
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,340
<i>so the police investigation
is back to square one.</i>

45
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,470
<i>Mr. Kang died last November</i>

46
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:25,590
<i>while trying to escape the prison</i>

47
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,600
<i>after being sentenced to death
for killing his wife.</i>

48
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:31,100
<i>The police think that this was
a deliberate act</i>

49
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:34,100
<i>to take advantage of the chaos
to weaken governmental authority</i>

50
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:36,440
<i>and plan to get to the bottom of it
immediately.</i>

51
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:43,320
DEAD BODY, COP

52
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:44,900
"Kang Gi-beom"?

53
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:49,120
DEAD BODY, COP KANG GI-BEOM

54
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,250
THIS PAGE CANNOT BE ACCESSED

55
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,170
He's dead?

56
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:00,250
DELETING NETWORK DATA

57
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:11,760
Hold on. I keep erasing stuff,
but it's never-ending.

58
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:15,310
Shall we just message them
and ask them to delete these?

59
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:17,310
Do you think they'll do it?

60
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:19,230
Just erase them and delete the accounts.

61
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:22,230
Are people not interested in Argos
anymore?

62
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,110
Everyone is talking about Gi-beom.

63
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:25,900
It'll only get worse because of the news.

64
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:27,780
How long will it take
to delete everything?

65
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:29,780
Let's focus.

66
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:33,620
Yes, ma'am. Focus.

67
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:36,410
Cleared.

68
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:37,920
Cleared.

69
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,210
No.

70
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:42,710
It's not true.

71
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:46,220
Why are you asking to speak
to a dead person?

72
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:54,180
Yes, we will find out who did this.

73
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:02,020
Detective Yang. This person saw a man
who looks like Kang Gi-beom.

74
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:03,860
Just say okay and hang up!

75
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:05,190
All right.

76
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,160
Take it easy.

77
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,870
A man died, and we have to catch a ghost?

78
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:18,460
Does it make sense to you?

79
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,420
What a crazy conspiracy theory.

80
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,840
We're surrounded by reporters right now.

81
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:25,420
Reporters? Why are they here?

82
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,800
You and Kang Gi-beom were friends.

83
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:30,590
Be careful.

84
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,010
Damn it!

85
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:39,270
This is the Violent Crimes Unit.

86
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:04,880
HWANG DEUK-GU

87
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,550
Oh, my goodness.

88
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:12,930
Mr. Vice Chairman, it's nice to hear
your voice first thing in the morning.

89
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:16,930
By the way, is it really okay
to cause big trouble like this?

90
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:20,560
What are you talking about?
We haven't even begun yet.

91
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:24,230
I'll take responsibility for everything.
Just enjoy the ride and rake in money.

92
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,690
If I could actually do that,
I'd be very grateful.

93
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:30,490
<i>Just make sure you get us
the things we need.</i>

94
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:34,070
We have plenty of dead bodies,
so don't you worry.

95
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:38,160
By the way, you acted as if
you'd never even talk to me again.

96
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:40,290
Why did you change your mind?

97
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:45,580
Work is work.
We should put personal feelings aside.

98
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:47,380
I'll remember that.

99
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,130
All right.
I hope all goes well. Talk later.

100
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:55,680
Nothing's going his way,

101
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:57,430
so he's desperate.

102
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:01,680
All right. Keep on sinking, Hwang Deuk-gu.

103
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:26,250
Hwang Deuk-gu didn't send him, though.
Will this be okay?

104
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:29,630
Have you seen a dead man talk?

105
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:31,880
Beat him up to a pulp and hang him.

106
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:36,260
Jeez, you moron.
You should've paid back the money on time.

107
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:38,390
It's not like we want to do this.

108
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:40,810
The economy is bad, so I'm struggling too.

109
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,930
If my wife and kids find out,

110
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:46,310
they'll be shocked.

111
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,980
Please make sure

112
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:50,940
they can never find my corpse.

113
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:52,530
If we deduct the labor costs,

114
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:54,860
we won't break even
with what we can make off your body.

115
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:58,160
Please spare my family.

116
00:09:58,780 --> 00:09:59,990
-Right?
-Yes.

117
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,370
-It'd be too cruel to kill all of you.
-Yes.

118
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:03,750
This isn't the Peach Garden Oath.

119
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:05,370
Don't worry too much.

120
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:07,670
We should spare the lives of those
who will pay us back.

121
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:10,090
Thank you. Thank you so much.

122
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:11,920
All right, no problem.

123
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,970
Okay, let's see.

124
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:23,680
"Kang Gi-beom is a murderer."

125
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,440
"Kang Gi-beom is alive."

126
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,650
Oh, I like this one.

127
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:32,190
"Kang Gi-beom is hiding amongst us."

128
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:33,440
What do you think?

129
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:36,950
By the way,
how did Kang Gi-beom get involved in this?

130
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:38,240
I have no idea.

131
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,280
I have no interest in learning about those
who have anything to do with Deuk-gu.

132
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:44,450
We should just do what we were told to do

133
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:46,750
and get paid for the job, okay?

134
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:48,330
Hang it around his neck and take him.

135
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:49,290
Okay.

136
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,250
What? What's going on?

137
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,770
What the hell?

138
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:17,030
Hey!

139
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,660
Who the hell are you? Identify yourself!

140
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:31,460
Usually, I just beat up bastards like you
without killing them and hand them over.

141
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:32,880
Who the fuck are you?

142
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:38,050
But today is an exception.

143
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,800
Fuck!

144
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:45,720
Hey, come here.

145
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:47,220
Don't come near me.

146
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,020
Stay away. You'd better stay put.

147
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:51,900
If you don't, I'll stab this guy! Okay?

148
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:31,640
POLICE LINE, DO NOT CROSS

149
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,610
What if we get caught?

150
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:38,230
Let's just leave, okay?

151
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,490
Hey, can't you hear
the subscriber count going up?

152
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:43,780
If I upload this,
the subscriber count will skyrocket.

153
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:48,030
Some of the hanged bodies were scorched.

154
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:52,330
I think this is where everything began.

155
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:55,080
-Hey, let's go in.
-What?

156
00:12:58,460 --> 00:12:59,460
Gosh.

157
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,810
Hey, stand there and record a video of me.

158
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,650
So that man, Kang Gi-beom, was here?

159
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:18,400
Hey, how could he have been here
when he's dead?

160
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:25,950
Are you ready?

161
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:34,960
Oh, my.

162
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:38,130
That's so dangerous.

163
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:54,060
A COP ASSAULTS THE CHAIRMAN OF ARGOS

164
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:55,890
How can I

165
00:13:57,230 --> 00:14:00,610
kill people who don't die
even if I kill them?

166
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,490
I'll just make them want to die.

167
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:08,280
Those who think they're just

168
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:11,410
can't bear getting their hands dirty.

169
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,910
That's why you're still alive.

170
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:17,420
You don't need to be ashamed.

171
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:20,540
It's okay to get your hands
a little dirty. Your survival comes first.

172
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,670
Min-jun.

173
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:27,430
Answer me, Seol Min-jun.

174
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:31,350
Yes, sir.

175
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:34,930
I like that you don't think.

176
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:38,060
You just do what you're told to do.

177
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:40,110
You said

178
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:42,320
I wouldn't be spared otherwise.

179
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:51,030
Just keep this up,
and you won't get whacked.

180
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:54,910
But from time to time,

181
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:57,500
I miss the old you.

182
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:06,550
You had a knack for blindsiding people.

183
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:18,180
About an ex-cop being pegged
as the perpetrator...

184
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:20,650
We made sure it'll be seen as a rumor.

185
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:24,020
People don't want to talk about it openly,
but most of them

186
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:27,490
believe that Argos was behind
the recent incidents.

187
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:29,490
If we manage to use the media wisely,

188
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:31,870
people will blame Argos

189
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,620
-instead of the police--
-All of that sounds nice,

190
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:36,950
but it's not realistic.

191
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:40,580
I didn't say it'd be easy.

192
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:41,880
It's not about that.

193
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,340
PARK ATTACK VICTIMS

194
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:49,840
This contains the park attack victims'
DNA test results.

195
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:51,800
They're all ordinary people.

196
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,470
What's crazier is that they're the victims
of missing-person

197
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,810
and abduction cases,
which the police failed to solve.

198
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,560
So the assailants were
ordinary people who were abducted?

199
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:03,610
Do you know how upset I am right now?

200
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:06,940
Kang Gi-beom or whatever his name is...
I wish he were alive.

201
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,530
I wish he were the real killer
so that I could put him behind bars.

202
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:15,030
I'll find a way to make sure
the police don't suffer any damage.

203
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,200
Chief Choi,

204
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,290
you're no exception.

205
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:19,910
You know that, right?

206
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:35,470
She's not an easy target.

207
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:04,120
<i>Gi-beom, can you hear me?</i>

208
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:06,540
Hey, Gwang-cheol. What's going on?

209
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:08,250
-The police--
-<i>They've figured out</i>

210
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:10,130
<i>that we're Rugal and that you're alive.</i>

211
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:11,760
<i>It's all over the Internet now.</i>

212
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,380
-What?
-<i>Run away.</i>

213
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:15,510
<i>If you get caught, you'll be screwed.</i>

214
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:16,590
Gwang-cheol.

215
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:38,120
What's going on?

216
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:26,410
MURDERER KANG GI-BEOM
CONFIRMED TO BE ALIVE, NOW ON THE RUN

217
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:50,520
<i>Wake up, Kang Gi-beom.</i>

218
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:53,270
Gosh.

219
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:55,570
You scared me.

220
00:18:57,490 --> 00:18:59,160
-What happened?
-What's wrong?

221
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,660
-Did someone chase you in your dream?
-"Dream"?

222
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:05,700
How long was I out for?

223
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:07,750
About ten minutes?

224
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:11,460
What is this?

225
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:13,250
Why am I here?

226
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:15,840
You were dizzy and hallucinating,
so I was doing some checkups.

227
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,130
I tied you down because you kept moving.

228
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:19,840
Those eyes are sensitive,
so you can't move during a checkup.

229
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:21,470
How are the eyes?

230
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,310
-They seem fine.
-They're fine?

231
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:26,060
Why? Is there something wrong?

232
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:28,310
Something is wrong
with either my eyes or my brain.

233
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:30,940
What do you mean?

234
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,190
I only read one line,
but my memories are shaky.

235
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,990
It's happened before,
but this feels totally different.

236
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:39,650
Those words are dictating
how I should think,

237
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,280
and I feel like they're controlling
my emotions too.

238
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:49,500
I've experienced something similar.

239
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:53,460
My ex-girlfriend sent me a wedding invite
to keep me in the loop.

240
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:57,170
But that moment,
the groom's name looked like my name.

241
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:59,880
I got all emotional.

242
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:03,510
I couldn't figure out what was real
and what was fake,

243
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:05,430
so I kept staring at it.

244
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:07,220
You see,

245
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,060
I loved her.

246
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:11,900
A lot.

247
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:14,610
Are you kidding me? This is serious.

248
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:18,070
What I'm saying is,
memory distortions are common.

249
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:19,740
So don't worry.

250
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:21,950
But just in case...

251
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:25,120
Okay. There.

252
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:31,080
I'll reset it.

253
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,380
I'm going to make some coffee.

254
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:56,190
<i>Removing the cause
of your cognitive dissonance.</i>

255
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:58,360
What? What is the cause?

256
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:08,660
Hey, what are you doing?

257
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:29,390
What's wrong?

258
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:06,380
Thanks, Tae-woong.

259
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:08,220
What's wrong?

260
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:12,640
Well, I suddenly got a weird feeling.

261
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,810
You and Gwang-cheol went after those guys.
What happened?

262
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:17,940
We caught them.

263
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:20,110
Tell me the details.

264
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:22,110
A few broken ribs
and a dislocated shoulder.

265
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:24,320
Abrasions and bruises all over.

266
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,780
They were handed over to the police
unconscious.

267
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:29,740
There's firm evidence, so they won't
be able to get out of it easily.

268
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:34,660
I'M THE CULPRIT

269
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:36,830
I'M THE MURDERER

270
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:44,920
Well done.

271
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:57,230
Don't tell anyone about
what happened today.

272
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:06,150
No.

273
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,910
I may be a rule-breaker,
but I can't sweep this under the rug.

274
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:12,200
You know nothing and I never came here.

275
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,660
Trouble with resetting

276
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:15,540
will incapacitate you during a blackout.

277
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:18,250
It's only until we find Dr. Oh.
I'll be careful.

278
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:19,540
Being careful won't cut it--

279
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:22,040
I don't want others to worry about me.

280
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:25,130
I'll tell you immediately
if anything is wrong,

281
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:27,470
so keep this a secret until then.

282
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,760
Got it?

283
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:45,360
My head...

284
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,720
Boss!

285
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,640
I have bad news.

286
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:55,730
Bong Man-cheol was arrested.

287
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:00,030
-Is that so?
-Yes.

288
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:04,160
He was going after a debtor
when he was caught at the scene.

289
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,490
If this gets traced back to you--

290
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:08,580
None of those I sent

291
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,410
were his clients though.

292
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:14,120
But the two of you--

293
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:16,590
All we do is conduct business together.

294
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:18,920
I provide him with the goods

295
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,510
while he makes money selling organs

296
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:22,720
or what-not.

297
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:26,470
His greed is what led to his arrest,

298
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:28,600
so how is that my problem?

299
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:31,980
I should've known that, boss.

300
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,480
Or are you saying

301
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:36,100
that I should clean up his ass?

302
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,570
I apologize, sir.

303
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:45,700
Know where your loyalty lies.

304
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:47,370
Yes, sir.

305
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:54,830
Fuck.

306
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:04,840
Ye-won,

307
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:07,840
one is supposed to find shelter
when it pours.

308
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:10,430
Why are you trying to solve this yourself?

309
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,640
Don't you remember what Chairman Ko said?

310
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:16,230
Even when we're at each other's throats,

311
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:18,690
we must unite to fight an outside enemy.

312
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:23,110
He isn't just a suspect.
He was caught red-handed.

313
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:24,690
There's no way out of it.

314
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:26,610
Nothing's impossible, Mi-joo.

315
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,740
All that matters is who our enemy is.

316
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:31,450
I get it and it's all good,

317
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:33,750
but why are you engaging
in the matter yourself

318
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:36,830
when it happened because
Hwang Deuk-gu was involved?

319
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,210
Because Argos is mine.

320
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:48,680
I don't want this to backfire on you,
that's all.

321
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,390
I'll just have to power through.

322
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:54,350
And let me say this since
we're on the subject.

323
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:56,180
Don't be outside of my circle.

324
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:01,560
Are you worrying about me

325
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:03,570
or threatening me?

326
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:08,780
Anyway, I have no intention
of taking the fall alone.

327
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:24,750
How dare you come in here.

328
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:28,630
That's not how you welcome
a guest that was invited.

329
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:30,840
And who the hell invited you?

330
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,680
Me.

331
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,560
What?

332
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:36,890
Can you give us the room?

333
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,730
You'd rather be with him alone

334
00:26:39,810 --> 00:26:41,520
after what he did to you the last time?

335
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:46,360
Get out.

336
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:49,820
Fine.

337
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,740
You go ahead and keep doing this.

338
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:08,590
Shouldn't the vice-chairman
at least make a visit?

339
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:09,800
A visit?

340
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:11,300
Visit whom?

341
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,680
Bong Man-cheol? Me?

342
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:19,020
One makes the mess
while the other cleans up after him.

343
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,480
Thanks to you, I'm busy these days,

344
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,480
so I thought it's the least you could do.

345
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,520
Of course.

346
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:30,200
How can you not be busy when you're
communicating with a dead man?

347
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:32,450
He had a sob story to tell.

348
00:27:32,530 --> 00:27:34,910
You've grown to be
way more considerate too.

349
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:41,210
It's why I'm the current chairman.

350
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:43,250
The job requires someone
with a generous heart.

351
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:45,290
Look at you lying through your teeth.

352
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:49,590
You're one to suck the blood out
of anyone that has anything useful.

353
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:53,220
Reassure Bong Man-cheol
so that he doesn't act out.

354
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:56,140
I'm meeting the Commissioner-General
this afternoon,

355
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:58,010
so be there as well.

356
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:01,230
It smells like Chairman Hyeon
had something to do with it.

357
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:03,310
This appointment didn't come easily,

358
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:05,940
so shut your trap until I say otherwise.

359
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:08,860
Then go alone why don't you?

360
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,820
This is my way of showing everyone

361
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:13,910
how far I'll willingly go
for the organization.

362
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:27,340
Why do you look upset?
You were only here for a few hours.

363
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:29,590
You have some nerve showing up here.

364
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:34,340
You think I betrayed you?

365
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:36,180
Shut up!

366
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:41,810
Shit.

367
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:47,360
Calling the cops
when we're doing business?

368
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:50,690
-You slimy coward.
-Man-cheol,

369
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:54,110
it wasn't the police or me
who put you in here.

370
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:55,700
What?

371
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:58,490
There's another force that's after us.

372
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:08,880
Here I am doing my best to catch them

373
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,500
even if that results in
getting stamped as a lunatic,

374
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:14,510
but the rest of you are too busy
only looking out for yourselves.

375
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:16,430
Let's be honest here.

376
00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:18,890
Who else but me has come to see you?

377
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:21,430
So you're saying that it was them

378
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:25,230
who tricked us with the body
and fucked things up a few days ago?

379
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:30,730
In order to find out who they are,
we must upend things.

380
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:37,910
You can get me out of here, right?

381
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:42,910
How does tomorrow afternoon sound to you?

382
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:46,080
I'll hold you to your word.

383
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,550
Shit.

384
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,330
Bring it to my car.

385
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:35,260
One down,

386
00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:39,130
one more to go.

387
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:43,100
Those in the political, financial,
and legal circles as well as the press

388
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:45,220
will lend a hand
in the rescuing of Bong Man-cheol.

389
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:47,520
Will that be possible
when it's an ironclad case?

390
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,850
They'll come up with
whatever reason they need.

391
00:30:50,810 --> 00:30:52,690
How can they when the whole world saw it?

392
00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:53,900
We can't let our guards down.

393
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:58,950
Argos finds it an embarrassment
to even have its ousted member imprisoned.

394
00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:00,320
Not the oddball though.

395
00:31:00,410 --> 00:31:02,530
He doesn't give a rat's ass
about the rules.

396
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:05,790
He could've used us
to get rid of Bong Man-cheol.

397
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:07,370
You think he used us?

398
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:08,790
That's not all.

399
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:12,420
He even mocked us by
dragging Gi-beom's name through the mud.

400
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,090
I wouldn't call it mocking.

401
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:15,670
Let's just say he made me a celebrity.

402
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,260
One wishes to get rid of Bong Man-cheol

403
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:22,010
while the other wants to save his ass?

404
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:24,550
Sounds like an internal turf war.

405
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:27,140
For now, we believe
Choi Ye-won is leading it.

406
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:28,810
In order to maintain her position,

407
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:30,600
she'll need Bong Man-cheol in his.

408
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:33,230
A few will try and take his position.

409
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:34,980
I agree.

410
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:37,280
Man-cheol's building
will be the battlefield.

411
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:38,940
Let's keep an eye out

412
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:41,780
for whom each of the players meet.

413
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:44,030
We'll tail them.

414
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,370
Sounds good.

415
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:47,410
Chief.

416
00:31:48,410 --> 00:31:50,410
Wouldn't this be dangerous for Gi-beom?

417
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:52,210
His face was exposed.

418
00:31:52,290 --> 00:31:55,420
When did we ever worry about such a thing?

419
00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:57,130
Gi-beom, you'll be on standby.

420
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:04,050
Sure.

421
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:45,470
MOPIN CREDIT

422
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:12,720
For someone who doesn't even trust
money counting machines,

423
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:14,930
this seems too poorly guarded.

424
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:21,190
I'll forget that I saw anything,

425
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:22,610
so please step aside.

426
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,360
Is that so?

427
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:30,240
MOPIN CREDIT BANK

428
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:49,470
First Hwang Deuk-gu and now Choi Yong.

429
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:51,970
Keep your eyes on them
and see if they clash.

430
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,810
Maybe I should get
an artificial eye myself.

431
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:59,270
Then I could easily
send you photos of them.

432
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:18,500
Damn it.

433
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:45,940
<i>Mismatch.
Two more failed retinal scans will result</i>

434
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:48,280
-<i>in the destruction of content.</i>
-Is that it?

435
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:50,900
All I need are Ko Yong-deok's eyeballs?

436
00:35:51,490 --> 00:35:53,610
What do you think you're doing here

437
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:56,120
without the owner's permission?

438
00:35:56,780 --> 00:36:00,080
I guess one can't change his ways.

439
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,960
I didn't expect much from an asshole.

440
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,960
So you lock Bong Man-cheol up

441
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,420
and go after the safety deposit boxes
in his building.

442
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:12,300
It's odd how you seem
to care about Man-cheol

443
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,680
but you never once visited him in prison.

444
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,720
I thought I'd come here instead
to check up on a thief.

445
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:21,560
-What?
-You have two attempts left,

446
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:23,100
so let your eyes be scanned.

447
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:24,350
Go ahead.

448
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:29,110
If I were you, I'd manage my business
instead of chasing others around.

449
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,990
I hear you're in the red.

450
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:37,700
From The Red Ants to Argos,

451
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:40,040
I've served this organization
for 40 years.

452
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:45,540
I'm nothing like the thug who's only been
cleaning up trash.

453
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:49,300
Try looking in a mirror, Deuk-gu.

454
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:52,920
What you'll see is a swine
that doesn't know its place

455
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:55,720
and is wiping his shit
all over his own house.

456
00:36:55,890 --> 00:36:57,890
You talk big for an old fox.

457
00:36:58,470 --> 00:37:01,970
But that doesn't change the fact
that you're a geezer now.

458
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:04,100
We come into this world with nothing

459
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:06,350
and that is your life story too.

460
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:08,900
You came empty-handed,

461
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:11,190
so just sit tight for a second.

462
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,360
I'll make sure you leave with nothing too.

463
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,910
Anyway, have fun burning your eyeballs.

464
00:37:17,410 --> 00:37:19,450
I'm off to see Man-cheol.

465
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:40,100
<i>The online shopping mall notified you
of its product being in stock.</i>

466
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:44,850
Don't pretend that
you're back to following my orders.

467
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:48,690
Mess with the files
in Yeo Jin's case again,

468
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:50,610
and I'll rip you out.

469
00:37:50,690 --> 00:37:52,940
<i>I was only following the analyzed result.</i>

470
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:55,240
All you'll do is report.
The decision is mine to make.

471
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,660
<i>Should I place an order on the product?</i>

472
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:58,570
Yes!

473
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:02,700
Now, don't talk until I call for you.
Got it?

474
00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:03,790
That's your punishment.

475
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:07,540
What the hell?

476
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:09,460
Turn yourself back on.

477
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:12,170
<i>Will you only enable mute mode?</i>

478
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:15,880
That's right. You happy now?

479
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:21,470
Jeez.

480
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:24,180
What a pain in the ass.

481
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:51,040
Don't touch anything.

482
00:38:53,170 --> 00:38:54,300
So you knew?

483
00:38:56,010 --> 00:38:58,470
You could've at least said hello.

484
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:01,430
All you do is fidget with gadgets.

485
00:39:04,850 --> 00:39:06,640
Don't kill me!

486
00:39:06,890 --> 00:39:09,560
-Was that fun enough?
-That's not fun.

487
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:15,730
I'm just bored out of my mind.

488
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:18,690
Wait, what are these?

489
00:39:21,410 --> 00:39:23,780
SUBJECT F100H

490
00:39:23,870 --> 00:39:26,740
Subject F100H. What's this?

491
00:39:26,830 --> 00:39:29,580
It sounds like
one of Rugal's earlier projects.

492
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,830
I have no interest in out-dated technology

493
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,750
which is why it's been collecting dust.

494
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:34,920
Rugal's earlier project?

495
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:37,670
Will this give me an insight
into Rugal's earlier days?

496
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,800
You'll need Chief Choi's authorization

497
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:42,430
or access the data on his computer.

498
00:39:51,270 --> 00:39:54,440
MOPIN CREDIT BANK

499
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,870
Choi Yong left earlier

500
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:10,960
and now Hwang Deuk-gu is on the move.

501
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,830
Surprisingly enough,
they're both in one piece.

502
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:14,670
Who should I tail?

503
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:17,380
Choi Yong's headed
to Yuyeon Police Station,

504
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:18,710
so tail Hwang Deuk-gu instead.

505
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:22,470
But Chief,

506
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:25,300
you sent Mi-na to shadow
the Commissioner-General.

507
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:26,470
Could it be...

508
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:27,560
He's not, right?

509
00:40:27,810 --> 00:40:29,010
Not with Argos.

510
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:31,100
It's what we hope for.

511
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:17,270
Thank you.

512
00:41:31,830 --> 00:41:33,580
How about this?

513
00:41:34,290 --> 00:41:35,160
Sure.

514
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,880
This doesn't look like a disguise to me.

515
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:47,090
Where is this from?

516
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:48,890
Can I play this role next time?

517
00:41:48,970 --> 00:41:51,390
You can if you want to
give me your artificial eyes.

518
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:53,270
That's one scary joke, Tae-woong.

519
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:57,480
Anyway, these seem to protect your eyes.

520
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:59,610
Yes, it's one of Bradley's inventions.

521
00:41:59,690 --> 00:42:01,440
Exactly, so can't I play this role?

522
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,650
Just let it go.

523
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:05,950
Let it go?
You think I'm Elsa or something?

524
00:42:06,030 --> 00:42:07,150
Jeez.

525
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:09,450
It was only a silly joke, you know.

526
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:16,290
What the hell?

527
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:18,290
You look beautiful.

528
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:19,880
I prefer to look cool.

529
00:42:21,130 --> 00:42:24,380
This is what a disguise looks like.
No one would guess that this is Mi-na.

530
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:25,300
Seriously?

531
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:28,430
Tae-woong, did you just laugh?

532
00:42:29,010 --> 00:42:30,970
No, I did no such thing.

533
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:33,510
Do you like the outfit I chose for you?

534
00:42:34,350 --> 00:42:35,930
I guess I do.

535
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:39,350
I mean, it's not that bad.

536
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:09,470
Chief, why are the Commissioner-General
Choi Ye-won in the same place?

537
00:43:09,550 --> 00:43:12,760
Let's not jump to conclusions,
but set up a camera just in case.

538
00:43:12,850 --> 00:43:13,800
Got it.

539
00:44:30,890 --> 00:44:32,020
I brought you some fruit.

540
00:44:33,770 --> 00:44:34,900
How sweet of you.

541
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:36,280
My pleasure, ma'am.

542
00:46:17,540 --> 00:46:18,790
Have you been waiting for long?

543
00:46:19,210 --> 00:46:20,170
No.

544
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:38,520
Tae-woong, Hwang Deuk-gu is here as well.

545
00:46:38,610 --> 00:46:39,730
He is?

546
00:46:39,820 --> 00:46:42,780
<i>I thought he and Ye-won
were out to get each other.</i>

547
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:44,190
Did he recognize you?

548
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:45,200
No.

549
00:46:45,990 --> 00:46:48,280
We did lock eyes,
but he didn't recognize me.

550
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:51,410
Lie low for now.

551
00:46:51,490 --> 00:46:52,700
Got it.

552
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:57,210
Put your hand down.

553
00:46:57,290 --> 00:47:00,090
Come on.
We're carrying out a mission here.

554
00:47:00,710 --> 00:47:01,800
It needs to be perfect.

555
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:05,090
It's too heavy.
This wig is already too heavy for me.

556
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:12,810
Thanks for what you did back there.

557
00:47:13,350 --> 00:47:15,770
I didn't know I'd meet him so up-close.

558
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:17,770
Do you know what shocked me?

559
00:47:17,850 --> 00:47:20,650
He actually took us for a couple.

560
00:47:20,730 --> 00:47:22,730
How's that possible?

561
00:47:22,820 --> 00:47:25,110
Are you having fun
with your snide remarks?

562
00:47:25,690 --> 00:47:27,240
You need some beating, don't you?

563
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:29,030
Mi-na, you've heard of this phrase, right?

564
00:47:29,110 --> 00:47:31,370
"Fool yourself before fooling others."

565
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:33,040
We are like...

566
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:34,490
How should I put it?

567
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:35,870
An unfinished work.

568
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:38,000
What do you think we need to do
to complete this?

569
00:47:38,790 --> 00:47:41,130
Shopping? Going for a drive?

570
00:47:42,090 --> 00:47:43,090
If not,

571
00:47:43,670 --> 00:47:45,460
how about a lovey-dovey time
over some steak?

572
00:47:46,050 --> 00:47:47,010
Shall we go for a swim?

573
00:47:47,090 --> 00:47:48,220
That sounds awesome.

574
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:51,090
-Over there.
-Over...

575
00:47:52,390 --> 00:47:53,810
Over there?

576
00:47:53,890 --> 00:47:54,970
Yes. Do you like it?

577
00:47:55,060 --> 00:47:56,680
Stop joking around.

578
00:47:57,310 --> 00:47:58,480
Did you just hit me?

579
00:47:59,310 --> 00:48:01,610
No, no.

580
00:48:01,690 --> 00:48:02,860
-Come here.
-No, no.

581
00:48:03,980 --> 00:48:05,320
Let Bong Man-cheol go.

582
00:48:06,150 --> 00:48:09,360
Ma'am, don't you know
the basic principles of negotiation?

583
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:11,700
You need to ask for something
that's attainable.

584
00:48:11,780 --> 00:48:14,490
Can you prove

585
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:16,790
that he was at the crime scene?

586
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:20,620
Of course. A courageous civilian
caught him and handed him over to--

587
00:48:20,710 --> 00:48:23,170
That's just what the police are claiming.

588
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:28,260
I can find out who that civilian was

589
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:30,630
or if they existed at all.

590
00:48:30,970 --> 00:48:32,840
If I want to play dirty,

591
00:48:32,930 --> 00:48:35,060
there's nothing stopping me.

592
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:42,100
What she's trying to say

593
00:48:43,060 --> 00:48:45,480
is that she wants us to be
more considerate toward each other.

594
00:48:45,570 --> 00:48:47,030
Let's just say

595
00:48:47,610 --> 00:48:49,690
that you were carrying out
a targeted investigation.

596
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:54,490
Say that he wasn't even
at the crime scene.

597
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:57,160
Make him out to be a lunatic

598
00:48:57,540 --> 00:48:59,700
who can neither give out orders

599
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:02,620
nor understand anything.

600
00:49:02,710 --> 00:49:04,710
Are you telling me to make a fool
out of ourselves

601
00:49:04,790 --> 00:49:06,340
just to spare some thug?

602
00:49:14,180 --> 00:49:15,720
Sir.

603
00:49:18,220 --> 00:49:19,890
You should mind your manners a bit more.

604
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:25,060
I'm just asking you to think

605
00:49:26,690 --> 00:49:28,020
from my perspective.

606
00:49:28,940 --> 00:49:30,740
I'm the Commissioner-General,

607
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:33,570
yet you want me to humiliate my own men.

608
00:49:35,070 --> 00:49:36,910
I think it's a bit--

609
00:49:53,380 --> 00:49:55,180
I think someone else came in.

610
00:49:56,430 --> 00:49:58,010
It's a pity we don't have a camera.

611
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:04,140
Do you remember why
the former Commissioner-General resigned?

612
00:50:05,650 --> 00:50:08,820
There were too many cold cases,

613
00:50:09,270 --> 00:50:11,280
and the crime rate didn't go down either.

614
00:50:11,780 --> 00:50:14,860
I promise to make you look competent.

615
00:50:15,860 --> 00:50:16,990
-Sorry?
-I'm sure you'll

616
00:50:17,070 --> 00:50:19,660
turn the page and become involved
in a new field in the future.

617
00:50:20,950 --> 00:50:21,910
It's your choice.

618
00:50:23,290 --> 00:50:27,040
Start anew, join us,
and live a long, prosperous life.

619
00:50:27,670 --> 00:50:31,340
Or remain in the police force
where our loyalty doesn't lie in.

620
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:40,390
You sure know how to negotiate.

621
00:50:41,310 --> 00:50:43,810
<i>Why are you there?</i>

622
00:50:44,430 --> 00:50:46,770
I'm sorry, but who are you?

623
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:50,020
Let's just say

624
00:50:50,860 --> 00:50:52,610
that I'm worth being in this room.

625
00:50:57,030 --> 00:50:58,160
Do you want to say something?

626
00:50:59,910 --> 00:51:00,910
I just have one question.

627
00:51:01,950 --> 00:51:03,830
You brought up a dead police officer

628
00:51:03,910 --> 00:51:07,370
and made the civilians lose trust
in the police force.

629
00:51:08,420 --> 00:51:09,460
How do you feel about that?

630
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:13,840
Please don't tell me

631
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:17,130
that you believe we were behind that.

632
00:51:18,510 --> 00:51:19,970
If that really happened,

633
00:51:20,220 --> 00:51:23,310
I'll find out who did it
and teach them a lesson.

634
00:51:26,430 --> 00:51:29,770
So you can trust me
and conclude our negotiation.

635
00:51:41,910 --> 00:51:42,990
Come out.

636
00:51:44,540 --> 00:51:46,870
I said come out, you geezer.

637
00:51:50,130 --> 00:51:52,590
COMPRESSOR ROOM

638
00:51:56,260 --> 00:51:57,260
Follow me.

639
00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:09,310
Hello, sir.

640
00:52:11,060 --> 00:52:12,400
Monitor the power well.

641
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:13,980
I don't want to see another blackout.

642
00:52:14,070 --> 00:52:15,190
Yes, sir.

643
00:52:30,870 --> 00:52:32,000
ELECTRICAL ROOM

644
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:50,230
Blue...

645
00:52:54,860 --> 00:52:55,770
Blue...

646
00:53:52,660 --> 00:53:53,960
Why? Is something wrong?

647
00:53:54,540 --> 00:53:56,580
There was a blackout. But something's odd.

648
00:53:57,210 --> 00:54:00,420
This level of power cannot be reached
unless someone intended.

649
00:54:01,010 --> 00:54:01,840
Chief.

650
00:54:03,380 --> 00:54:05,550
I've been monitoring
power usages constantly,

651
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:07,430
and an odd place had a blackout.

652
00:54:07,970 --> 00:54:10,100
-Where is that?
-One second.

653
00:54:11,310 --> 00:54:12,180
Here.

654
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:16,900
It might be Dr. Oh's distress signal.

655
00:54:17,860 --> 00:54:19,770
You mean he used the blackout
to send us a signal?

656
00:54:21,820 --> 00:54:23,110
Shouldn't we go check it out?

657
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:26,530
Yes.

658
00:54:34,410 --> 00:54:35,420
Yes, sir.

659
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:38,630
I'm on my way.

660
00:54:45,260 --> 00:54:46,510
They've located Dr. Oh.

661
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:49,470
-How?
-Susan found him.

662
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:54,100
Gi-beom will meet us there,
so let's hurry.

663
00:54:54,180 --> 00:54:55,190
All right.

664
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:16,290
I'll drop her home, so you may leave.

665
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:19,000
-What are you--
-Go!

666
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:25,970
I'll drive you home today.

667
00:55:26,050 --> 00:55:27,510
Don't be ridiculous.

668
00:55:29,090 --> 00:55:32,220
I should find out whom to punish.

669
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:36,100
I wonder who sent this message.

670
00:55:36,180 --> 00:55:37,190
MEET ME BY THE RESERVOIR

671
00:55:41,230 --> 00:55:42,690
Don't play jokes with me.

672
00:55:43,530 --> 00:55:44,530
Aren't you curious?

673
00:55:44,610 --> 00:55:45,940
Is this about Kang Gi-beom?

674
00:56:05,340 --> 00:56:06,340
Open this right now.

675
00:56:07,130 --> 00:56:08,800
You asked if I liked you.

676
00:56:11,340 --> 00:56:12,510
If I said yes,

677
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:15,100
would you accept me?

678
00:56:25,570 --> 00:56:27,190
Hey, fix that!

679
00:56:28,030 --> 00:56:29,820
Hurry up!

680
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:31,990
If you don't clean up properly,

681
00:56:32,070 --> 00:56:33,530
I'll kill you all.

682
00:56:33,620 --> 00:56:35,910
If you don't want to lick the floor clean,

683
00:56:35,990 --> 00:56:37,540
do a good job.

684
00:56:37,830 --> 00:56:41,960
Sir, I don't think
we can fix this ourselves.

685
00:56:42,130 --> 00:56:43,500
We should call a technician.

686
00:56:43,710 --> 00:56:46,420
Hey, do you think we have money to waste?

687
00:56:46,630 --> 00:56:48,550
Hurry up and fix this!

688
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:05,820
I was away for half the day,
but man, am I glad to see you.

689
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:07,650
Did you rest up well?

690
00:57:07,730 --> 00:57:08,820
I guess.

691
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:11,820
But I'll work twice as hard,
so don't worry.

692
00:57:13,870 --> 00:57:15,950
Are you sure Dr. Oh is in there?

693
00:57:16,530 --> 00:57:17,490
I think so.

694
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:18,750
Anything else to tell us?

695
00:57:18,830 --> 00:57:21,750
It's going to be a mess in there
due to the blackout.

696
00:57:21,830 --> 00:57:24,250
We'll destroy them from the inside out.

697
00:57:25,630 --> 00:57:29,340
-I've been waiting for this moment.
-I hope it's worth it.

698
00:57:30,210 --> 00:57:31,380
I've been cleaning up all day.

699
00:57:31,470 --> 00:57:33,590
Yes, that's a good expression.

700
00:57:34,970 --> 00:57:36,930
Let's clean them all up.

701
00:57:38,310 --> 00:57:39,430
Let's go.

702
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:23,810
Let's go this way.

703
00:58:53,510 --> 00:58:55,800
<i>They restored the power.</i>

704
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:57,890
Gwang-cheol, turn the lights on.

705
00:59:37,790 --> 00:59:45,500

<i>Why did I do that?</i>

707
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:06,580
<i>Did I mistake him for a test subject?</i>

708
01:00:06,790 --> 01:00:09,330
What happens if the artificial eyes
take control of me?

709
01:00:09,420 --> 01:00:11,330
<i>You will lose yourself
and live by its orders.</i>

710
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:14,960
<i>He risked his own life and walked into it.</i>

711
01:00:15,050 --> 01:00:17,130
Then we should play along with him.

712
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:19,880
<i>We might be played by Hwang Deuk-gu.</i>

713
01:00:20,090 --> 01:00:22,010
<i>Change the D-day to today.</i>

714
01:00:22,090 --> 01:00:23,260
<i>Get started.</i>

715
01:00:23,350 --> 01:00:26,310
<i>He will come out and reveal all the truth.</i>

716
01:00:27,100 --> 01:00:28,520
<i>What if he refuses?</i>

717
01:00:29,350 --> 01:00:31,060
<i>I am who Hwang Deuk-gu wants.</i>
