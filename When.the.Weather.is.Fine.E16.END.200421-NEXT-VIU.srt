00:23:19,636 --> 00:23:22,146
<b>(For my dear mom, Yun Yeo Jeong)</b>

319
00:23:28,716 --> 00:23:32,255
<b>(For my dear mom, Yun Yeo Jeong)</b>

320
00:23:38,525 --> 00:23:40,795
<b>I bought the scarf and then...</b>

321
00:23:42,495 --> 00:23:43,565
<b>I see.</b>

322
00:23:45,896 --> 00:23:47,295
<b>You should go, Son.</b>

323
00:23:47,995 --> 00:23:50,835
<b>I want to be alone.</b>

324
00:23:52,376 --> 00:23:53,376
<b>Okay.</b>

325
00:24:10,886 --> 00:24:15,926
<b>(For my dear mom, Yun Yeo Jeong)</b>

326
00:24:28,906 --> 00:24:35,745
<b>(For my dear mom, Yun Yeo Jeong)</b>

327
00:24:51,525 --> 00:24:53,335
<b>- Welcome. - Welcome.</b>

328
00:25:06,275 --> 00:25:07,575
<b>Enjoy.</b>

329
00:25:20,696 --> 00:25:21,825
<b>How have you been?</b>

330
00:25:22,196 --> 00:25:23,196
<b>I've been good.</b>

331
00:25:23,666 --> 00:25:24,866
<b>You look good in that.</b>

332
00:25:27,136 --> 00:25:28,235
<b>Isn't the coffee good?</b>

333
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:29,305
<b>It really is.</b>

334
00:25:30,436 --> 00:25:32,936
<b>By the way, the cafe is called...</b>

335
00:25:34,436 --> 00:25:37,146
<b>That's right. It's the name of the song you once played.</b>

336
00:25:38,345 --> 00:25:42,045
<b>What? You almost sound like you've liked me for a long time.</b>

337
00:25:42,745 --> 00:25:45,085
<b>But I have liked you for a long time.</b>

338
00:25:52,126 --> 00:25:53,255
<b>You didn't fall for it?</b>

339
00:25:53,795 --> 00:25:55,396
<b>No, I didn't.</b>

340
00:25:56,525 --> 00:25:57,926
<b>How did you know?</b>

341
00:25:58,835 --> 00:26:01,065
<b>That I didn't really mean it...</b>

342
00:26:01,636 --> 00:26:03,606
<b>when I said I liked you for a long time?</b>

343
00:26:05,035 --> 00:26:07,476
<b>Well, how did I know?</b>

344
00:26:11,146 --> 00:26:12,716
<b>That's because...</b>

345
00:26:35,636 --> 00:26:36,636
<b>Hi.</b>

346
00:26:39,136 --> 00:26:41,176
<b>Did I do something that gave me away?</b>

347
00:26:42,005 --> 00:26:43,005
<b>No.</b>

348
00:26:48,745 --> 00:26:49,745
<b>That's because...</b>

349
00:26:51,755 --> 00:26:55,156
<b>I know the eyes of someone who liked me for a long time.</b>

350
00:27:07,166 --> 00:27:09,366
<b>I think you should redo the whole thing.</b>

351
00:27:09,366 --> 00:27:11,366
<b>Gosh, we're not even getting many customers.</b>

352
00:27:11,366 --> 00:27:12,535
<b>This is annoying.</b>

353
00:27:12,835 --> 00:27:14,575
<b>- Did you hear that? - Nice!</b>

354
00:27:17,075 --> 00:27:18,545
<b>Guys.</b>

355
00:27:19,216 --> 00:27:20,376
<b>Listen up.</b>

356
00:27:20,376 --> 00:27:23,015
<b>I'm going to make something like the Jeju Olle Trail...</b>

357
00:27:23,015 --> 00:27:25,255
<b>- here in Hyecheon. - Hey, that's enough.</b>

358
00:27:25,255 --> 00:27:26,616
<b>Stop talking about Hyecheon already.</b>

359
00:27:26,616 --> 00:27:28,686
<b>He has nothing else to talk about anyway. Let him be.</b>

360
00:27:28,686 --> 00:27:31,186
<b>- Right. - Imagine how nice it will be.</b>

361
00:27:31,186 --> 00:27:32,325
<b>For the city of Hyecheon...</b>

362
00:27:32,325 --> 00:27:33,795
<b>Here comes Ji Eun Sil.</b>

363
00:27:33,795 --> 00:27:35,626
<b>- Hey! - Guys, I'm sorry I'm late.</b>

364
00:27:35,626 --> 00:27:37,595
<b>- Hi! - Hi, Eun Sil!</b>

365
00:27:37,595 --> 00:27:38,866
<b>Why didn't you show up the other day?</b>

366
00:27:38,866 --> 00:27:40,196
<b>It's been so long.</b>

367
00:27:40,196 --> 00:27:42,906
<b>Eun Sil, don't you have to work tomorrow? What are you doing here?</b>

368
00:27:42,906 --> 00:27:44,035
<b>Did you take a day off again?</b>

369
00:27:44,035 --> 00:27:46,575
<b>I quit.</b>

370
00:27:46,936 --> 00:27:49,206
<b>- In times like these? - You're crazy.</b>

371
00:27:49,646 --> 00:27:51,545
<b>After complaining all the time,</b>

372
00:27:51,545 --> 00:27:53,646
<b>you quit in the end? I can't believe this.</b>

373
00:27:53,876 --> 00:27:55,845
<b>When you think it's too late, it probably is.</b>

374
00:27:55,845 --> 00:27:58,116
<b>So you should quit as soon as you can.</b>

375
00:27:58,245 --> 00:28:00,755
<b>Don't you guys know how much I suffered?</b>

376
00:28:00,755 --> 00:28:02,426
<b>- Right, Jang Woo? - What? Me?</b>

377
00:28:02,426 --> 00:28:03,985
<b>- Right, guys? - Suit yourself.</b>

378
00:28:04,285 --> 00:28:05,525
<b>Forget it. Give me a glass.</b>

379
00:28:05,525 --> 00:28:06,555
<b>Here you go.</b>

380
00:28:07,255 --> 00:28:08,595
<b>- Hey, Jang Woo. - What?</b>

381
00:28:08,595 --> 00:28:11,366
<b>You seem quite close with Eun Sil.</b>

382
00:28:11,366 --> 00:28:12,866
<b>I know, what's going on? Something smells fishy.</b>

383
00:28:12,866 --> 00:28:14,735
<b>It's not that. As a proud...</b>

384
00:28:14,735 --> 00:28:17,366
<b>civil servant of Hyecheon, I'm concerned about her unemployment...</b>

385
00:28:17,366 --> 00:28:18,366
<b>By the way, Eun Sil.</b>

386
00:28:18,366 --> 00:28:20,606
<b>When you weren't here last time, Jang Woo said...</b>

387
00:28:20,606 --> 00:28:23,146
<b>you were the one who had a crush on him.</b>

388
00:28:23,146 --> 00:28:24,305
<b>I remember that.</b>

389
00:28:24,305 --> 00:28:25,775
<b>Tell us the truth. Did Jang Woo hit on you...</b>

390
00:28:25,775 --> 00:28:27,015
<b>at the joint reunion or not?</b>

391
00:28:27,045 --> 00:28:28,416
<b>- Really? - Gosh, how did you know?</b>

392
00:28:28,416 --> 00:28:29,515
<b>- Let me see. - Stop it.</b>

393
00:28:29,515 --> 00:28:31,686
<b>I miss Eun Seop. I wonder where he is.</b>

394
00:28:31,686 --> 00:28:32,886
<b>There he is.</b>

395
00:28:32,886 --> 00:28:34,616
<b>- Hey! - It's Eun Seop.</b>

396
00:28:34,616 --> 00:28:35,886
<b>Speak of the devil.</b>

397
00:28:35,886 --> 00:28:38,226
<b>Eun Seop, sit here, handsome.</b>

398
00:28:39,426 --> 00:28:40,726
<b>Take a seat.</b>

399
00:28:41,456 --> 00:28:42,696
<b>You're so funny.</b>

400
00:28:42,795 --> 00:28:44,666
<b>- Gosh. - How's the bookstore?</b>

401
00:28:44,765 --> 00:28:45,866
<b>It's not bad.</b>

402
00:28:45,866 --> 00:28:49,065
<b>By the way, I was always curious about this.</b>

403
00:28:49,065 --> 00:28:51,466
<b>How did Eun Seop and Jang Woo become friends?</b>

404
00:28:51,466 --> 00:28:53,406
<b>I know, they are a strange duo.</b>

405
00:28:53,406 --> 00:28:56,005
<b>You guys don't know? Eun Seop saved Jang Woo.</b>

406
00:28:56,005 --> 00:28:58,946
<b>You know, when those bullies dragged Jang Woo to the mountain...</b>

407
00:28:58,946 --> 00:29:00,515
<b>and tied him up with a rope and beat him up.</b>

408
00:29:00,515 --> 00:29:02,815
<b>Hey, how do you know that?</b>

409
00:29:02,916 --> 00:29:04,045
<b>You told me.</b>

410
00:29:04,045 --> 00:29:05,416
<b>- I did? - You did.</b>

411
00:29:05,416 --> 00:29:06,956
<b>I did? When?</b>

412
00:29:06,956 --> 00:29:09,085
<b>How did he go to Seoul National University with that memory?</b>

413
00:29:09,085 --> 00:29:11,025
<b>Beats me, I guess he got lucky or something.</b>

414
00:29:11,025 --> 00:29:14,055
<b>Hold on a second. When did I tell you that?</b>

415
00:29:14,055 --> 00:29:16,765
<b>It was written in the letter you gave me with 100 roses.</b>

416
00:29:16,765 --> 00:29:20,136
<b>"I'm the school president, Lee Jang Woo."</b>

417
00:29:20,136 --> 00:29:22,235
<b>"Although I may seem perfectly normal to you,."</b>

418
00:29:22,235 --> 00:29:23,565
<b>- Stop. - "to tell you the truth..."</b>

419
00:29:23,565 --> 00:29:24,765
<b>- Who was it? - Jae Yeong.</b>

420
00:29:24,765 --> 00:29:26,976
<b>Right. "I'm being bullied by Jae Yeong and his friends."</b>

421
00:29:26,976 --> 00:29:28,706
<b>Stop. Stop it!</b>

422
00:29:29,176 --> 00:29:31,376
<b>Don't laugh. I told you not to laugh.</b>

423
00:29:31,376 --> 00:29:33,476
<b>- That's so funny. - He looks embarrassed.</b>

424
00:29:33,676 --> 00:29:35,015
<b>Come on, stop it.</b>

425
00:29:35,015 --> 00:29:36,886
<b>He wants us to stop teasing him.</b>

426
00:29:37,815 --> 00:29:40,116
<b>Do you remember back then...</b>

427
00:29:40,886 --> 00:29:42,055
<b>How about a second round?</b>

428
00:29:42,156 --> 00:29:44,985
<b>Hey, I'll let you know how much each of you owes me.</b>

429
00:29:44,985 --> 00:29:48,156
<b>- Thank you. - Thank you for today's meal.</b>

430
00:29:48,156 --> 00:29:49,396
<b>You better all wire me money!</b>

431
00:29:49,396 --> 00:29:51,366
<b>- Thank you for buying tonight. - Come on.</b>

432
00:29:51,366 --> 00:29:55,065
<b>Why don't we go somewhere else next time? Please?</b>

433
00:29:55,065 --> 00:29:57,535
<b>Why don't you try reserving a place? Do you know how hard it is?</b>

434
00:29:57,535 --> 00:29:58,706
<b>Right, you try it.</b>

435
00:29:58,805 --> 00:30:01,636
<b>Stop fighting. What's the matter with you two?</b>

436
00:30:01,636 --> 00:30:03,646
<b>- Seriously. - Why didn't Hae Won come today?</b>

437
00:30:03,646 --> 00:30:05,845
<b>- I miss her so much. - Me too.</b>

438
00:30:05,845 --> 00:30:06,876
<b>Shall I call her?</b>

439
00:30:06,876 --> 00:30:09,646
<b>No, don't call her. She went back to Seoul.</b>

440
00:30:09,646 --> 00:30:11,146
<b>Forget it. Don't call her.</b>

441
00:30:11,146 --> 00:30:13,886
<b>- It's time to go. Come on. - I had fun tonight.</b>

442
00:30:13,886 --> 00:30:15,656
<b>- Bye. - Let's go for a second round.</b>

443
00:30:15,656 --> 00:30:17,726
<b>Have a second round at home.</b>

444
00:30:17,726 --> 00:30:19,095
<b>- Let's go. - Bye!</b>

445
00:30:19,095 --> 00:30:20,495
<b>- Goodnight. - Get going.</b>

446
00:30:20,495 --> 00:30:22,525
<b>- See you. - Bye!</b>

447
00:30:22,525 --> 00:30:24,095
<b>How about a second round with me?</b>

448
00:30:24,095 --> 00:30:25,966
<b>- Of course. - All right.</b>

449
00:30:25,966 --> 00:30:27,495
<b>- Let's go. - Just go home.</b>

450
00:30:27,495 --> 00:30:29,565
<b>- We're going for another round. - Stop drinking, you pig.</b>

451
00:30:29,565 --> 00:30:30,636
<b>Don't call me a pig.</b>

452
00:30:30,636 --> 00:30:32,876
<b>- He keeps calling me a pig. - Are you two going out?</b>

453
00:30:32,876 --> 00:30:34,706
<b>- I feel insulted. Hey! - No!</b>

454
00:30:34,706 --> 00:30:36,176
<b>How could you say something like that?</b>

455
00:30:36,176 --> 00:30:37,805
<b>- I feel insulted. - We're not going out.</b>

456
00:30:37,805 --> 00:30:39,545
<b>Of course, we're not going out.</b>

457
00:32:10,666 --> 00:32:12,906
<b>Myeong Ju, where's the nail clipper?</b>

458
00:32:13,575 --> 00:32:15,305
<b>I can't find it.</b>

459
00:32:17,775 --> 00:32:20,946
<b>- You... - You didn't leave yet?</b>

460
00:32:22,186 --> 00:32:23,845
<b>I came because I thought you were gone.</b>

461
00:32:24,985 --> 00:32:27,015
<b>Wait. What is...</b>

462
00:32:29,325 --> 00:32:30,626
<b>Hey, Hae Won.</b>

463
00:32:34,926 --> 00:32:37,825
<b>Hey, I really can't give you fried eggs for free now.</b>

464
00:32:37,825 --> 00:32:40,995
<b>- All right, whatever. - Stop asking for them!</b>

465
00:32:45,906 --> 00:32:47,775
<b>When are you planning on going back this time?</b>

466
00:32:48,305 --> 00:32:50,176
<b>I don't know, about a week later?</b>

467
00:32:51,845 --> 00:32:53,176
<b>What about your academy interviews?</b>

468
00:32:53,275 --> 00:32:54,646
<b>I failed all of them.</b>

469
00:32:55,315 --> 00:32:56,515
<b>Is that so?</b>

470
00:32:56,886 --> 00:32:58,755
<b>So I'm thinking of...</b>

471
00:32:58,755 --> 00:33:01,686
<b>renting a studio with my classmates from school to open up an institute.</b>

472
00:33:04,386 --> 00:33:06,926
<b>There's nothing else I'm particularly good at...</b>

473
00:33:06,926 --> 00:33:08,865
<b>besides teaching kids.</b>

474
00:33:11,965 --> 00:33:14,796
<b>You said you don't have the right to teach someone.</b>

475
00:33:15,865 --> 00:33:18,236
<b>- That's true. - But?</b>

476
00:33:19,035 --> 00:33:20,106
<b>Well,</b>

477
00:33:20,436 --> 00:33:22,976
<b>I still don't know if I have the right,</b>

478
00:33:23,745 --> 00:33:25,245
<b>but when I tried it again,</b>

479
00:33:25,245 --> 00:33:28,445
<b>I felt what I've done isn't that bad after all.</b>

480
00:33:30,586 --> 00:33:31,845
<b>I don't know what you mean.</b>

481
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:33,615
<b>What I mean is,</b>

482
00:33:34,515 --> 00:33:37,726
<b>my life in Seoul was so lonely and stressful,</b>

483
00:33:38,586 --> 00:33:41,126
<b>so I guess I started hating what I was doing.</b>

484
00:33:42,296 --> 00:33:43,325
<b>But...</b>

485
00:33:43,896 --> 00:33:47,035
<b>after getting warmed up and trying it again,</b>

486
00:33:47,865 --> 00:33:50,465
<b>I started to see clearly how my life path was.</b>

487
00:33:51,135 --> 00:33:53,575
<b>- And how was that? - Well...</b>

488
00:33:54,776 --> 00:33:58,075
<b>I realized it wasn't that bad after all.</b>

489
00:33:58,675 --> 00:34:01,146
<b>There were times when I was happy. Something like that.</b>

490
00:34:01,146 --> 00:34:02,146
<b>That's nice.</b>

491
00:34:05,345 --> 00:34:06,986
<b>When will you open up the institution?</b>

492
00:34:06,986 --> 00:34:09,226
<b>It hasn't been decided for sure yet.</b>

493
00:34:09,726 --> 00:34:12,925
<b>Mom, are you here for good?</b>

494
00:34:12,925 --> 00:34:15,925
<b>Yes. I sold the house in Paju.</b>

495
00:34:17,896 --> 00:34:18,995
<b>That's nice.</b>

496
00:34:21,265 --> 00:34:23,236
<b>Did you live there?</b>

497
00:34:23,936 --> 00:34:25,106
<b>I did.</b>

498
00:34:25,905 --> 00:34:28,135
<b>I fixed the place up and sold it at a good price.</b>

499
00:34:29,876 --> 00:34:31,006
<b>That's nice.</b>

500
00:34:36,316 --> 00:34:39,215
<b>There may be no seats at this place.</b>

501
00:34:43,486 --> 00:34:46,626
<b>Hey. Hi, Hae Won.</b>

502
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:47,825
<b>When did you come?</b>

503
00:34:47,825 --> 00:34:51,566
<b>Oh, just now. I came to eat.</b>

504
00:34:51,566 --> 00:34:53,495
<b>Well, I don't see any empty seats.</b>

505
00:34:53,495 --> 00:34:54,765
<b>We have a bunch of empty seats.</b>

506
00:34:54,765 --> 00:34:57,465
<b>No, it's fine. I want to eat in the sun.</b>

507
00:34:57,465 --> 00:34:58,876
<b>The weather is lovely today.</b>

508
00:34:58,876 --> 00:35:00,805
<b>Hae Won, I'll see you later.</b>

509
00:35:01,236 --> 00:35:02,706
<b>Call me later.</b>

510
00:35:02,905 --> 00:35:06,476
<b>Hello... Enjoy your meal. I like your sunglasses.</b>

511
00:35:06,476 --> 00:35:09,285
<b>Well, see you later. I'll call you.</b>

512
00:35:10,715 --> 00:35:13,715
<b>There are no seats left in this place.</b>

513
00:35:13,715 --> 00:35:14,885
<b>What? It looks like they have seats.</b>

514
00:35:14,885 --> 00:35:17,026
<b>No, I already took a look inside.</b>

515
00:35:17,026 --> 00:35:18,655
<b>Let's go. There are no seats.</b>

516
00:35:19,055 --> 00:35:20,995
<b>- But there are... - No, let's just go.</b>

517
00:35:20,995 --> 00:35:22,526
<b>There are no seats. How about some rice noodles?</b>

518
00:35:22,526 --> 00:35:24,226
<b>What do you want? Let's eat something nice.</b>

519
00:35:47,486 --> 00:35:49,655
<b>- See you. - Okay.</b>

520
00:35:49,655 --> 00:35:50,885
<b>Bye, Auntie.</b>

521
00:35:51,526 --> 00:35:52,595
<b>Okay.</b>

522
00:35:53,126 --> 00:35:54,195
<b>Bring my stuff.</b>

523
00:35:54,595 --> 00:35:56,626
<b>Wait, that's it?</b>

524
00:36:00,066 --> 00:36:02,635
<b>I guess you're not the clingy type of family.</b>

525
00:36:02,635 --> 00:36:03,666
<b>Goodbye, then.</b>

526
00:36:03,666 --> 00:36:05,405
<b>- Goodbye. - Bye.</b>

527
00:36:08,405 --> 00:36:12,006
<b>Hey, how could you say goodbye like that?</b>

528
00:36:12,006 --> 00:36:14,515
<b>What? That was good enough.</b>

529
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:34,166
<b>Are you going to come back?</b>

530
00:36:34,836 --> 00:36:35,836
<b>No.</b>

531
00:36:37,465 --> 00:36:40,405
<b>I won't come back for the rest of my life.</b>

532
00:37:42,506 --> 00:37:45,535
<b>- How about a steamed dish? - A steamed dish? A stew?</b>

533
00:37:45,535 --> 00:37:48,506
<b>Stew sounds good. I know a nice place.</b>

534
00:37:48,506 --> 00:37:49,706
<b>- Let's go. - Good.</b>

535
00:37:51,945 --> 00:37:54,376
<b>- I'll catch up with you guys. - Okay.</b>

536
00:37:58,885 --> 00:37:59,956
<b>Ji Eun Sil.</b>

537
00:38:00,785 --> 00:38:02,285
<b>- Eun Sil! - Oh, my goodness!</b>

538
00:38:02,385 --> 00:38:03,925
<b>Where did you pop out from?</b>

539
00:38:03,925 --> 00:38:06,055
<b>Me? From there. What are you doing?</b>

540
00:38:06,055 --> 00:38:08,896
<b>I'm jobless. I felt guilty sitting at home, so I stepped out.</b>

541
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:10,365
<b>- I see. - What about you?</b>

542
00:38:10,365 --> 00:38:12,265
<b>Me? I'm not doing anything.</b>

543
00:38:12,265 --> 00:38:13,465
<b>What? But you were...</b>

544
00:38:13,465 --> 00:38:15,736
<b>Oh, I'm going to take the rest of the day off.</b>

545
00:38:17,066 --> 00:38:18,066
<b>Okay.</b>

546
00:38:18,166 --> 00:38:19,936
<b>I'm going to do it now.</b>

547
00:38:20,106 --> 00:38:21,675
<b>- Okay, go. - What will you do after your walk?</b>

548
00:38:21,675 --> 00:38:23,706
<b>I have no plans. I have so much time on my hands.</b>

549
00:38:23,706 --> 00:38:25,816
<b>Why do you ask? Do you want to do something?</b>

550
00:38:26,146 --> 00:38:27,615
<b>Let's think about it.</b>

551
00:38:27,615 --> 00:38:28,916
<b>Shall we go to the movies?</b>

552
00:38:29,345 --> 00:38:31,416
<b>Then do you want to go hiking?</b>

553
00:38:31,416 --> 00:38:34,015
<b>Or how about we go to the market and grab a bite to eat?</b>

554
00:38:34,785 --> 00:38:35,885
<b>How about a convenience store?</b>

555
00:38:35,885 --> 00:38:37,026
<b>- A convenience store. - What?</b>

556
00:38:37,026 --> 00:38:38,655
<b>I've actually eaten, so I'm full now.</b>

557
00:38:38,655 --> 00:38:40,296
<b>Me too. I'm stuffed.</b>

558
00:38:40,296 --> 00:38:41,925
<b>I am craving something right now though.</b>

559
00:38:41,925 --> 00:38:43,126
<b>I want a milkshake.</b>

560
00:38:43,126 --> 00:38:45,066
<b>But you can't get milkshakes anywhere in this area.</b>

561
00:38:45,066 --> 00:38:46,465
<b>Seriously, it's gone.</b>

562
00:38:46,465 --> 00:38:50,006
<b>So how about we try to find ice cream...</b>

563
00:38:50,006 --> 00:38:51,865
<b>that tastes like a milkshake?</b>

564
00:38:53,476 --> 00:38:55,336
<b>- Sure, let's go. - My gosh!</b>

565
00:38:55,606 --> 00:38:57,106
<b>You're so awesome.</b>

566
00:38:57,106 --> 00:38:58,106
<b>What? What did I do?</b>

567
00:38:58,106 --> 00:39:00,316
<b>Forget it. Stop blushing.</b>

568
00:39:00,316 --> 00:39:01,515
<b>Go submit that thing.</b>

569
00:39:01,515 --> 00:39:02,945
<b>I'll wait right here.</b>

570
00:39:02,945 --> 00:39:04,785
<b>Okay, I'll go take the rest of the day off.</b>

571
00:39:19,236 --> 00:39:21,836
<b>Thanks, Cha Yun Taek. For driving me.</b>

572
00:39:24,635 --> 00:39:25,635
<b>You're not going to cry?</b>

573
00:39:27,206 --> 00:39:28,675
<b>I will no longer cry.</b>

574
00:39:32,046 --> 00:39:33,215
<b>Hey, Shim Myeong Yeo.</b>

575
00:39:34,276 --> 00:39:35,646
<b>You're really not going to come back?</b>

576
00:39:35,646 --> 00:39:38,015
<b>No, I'm never coming back.</b>

577
00:39:38,316 --> 00:39:40,356
<b>You can't even visit?</b>

578
00:39:41,555 --> 00:39:43,325
<b>You know, from time to time.</b>

579
00:39:43,726 --> 00:39:46,555
<b>You can visit when you miss this place a lot.</b>

580
00:39:50,965 --> 00:39:52,595
<b>Well...</b>

581
00:39:55,066 --> 00:39:56,066
<b>I don't want to do that.</b>

582
00:39:57,736 --> 00:39:58,736
<b>I won't.</b>

583
00:40:36,046 --> 00:40:37,106
<b>Run.</b>

584
00:40:37,206 --> 00:40:38,675
<b>- What? - Run!</b>

585
00:40:38,805 --> 00:40:40,845
<b>Why are you just standing there?</b>

586
00:40:40,845 --> 00:40:42,945
<b>Why are you in such a rush, Eun Sil? All right, I'm coming.</b>

587
00:40:42,945 --> 00:40:45,245
<b>You'd better run unless you want me to teach you a lesson.</b>

588
00:40:45,245 --> 00:40:46,916
<b>You didn't hear me?</b>

589
00:40:46,916 --> 00:40:48,055
<b>No, I couldn't hear anything.</b>

590
00:40:48,055 --> 00:40:49,256
<b>Why you little...</b>

591
00:40:49,256 --> 00:40:50,256
<b>What?</b>

592
00:40:50,325 --> 00:40:52,155
<b>Gosh, you said you'd be right back.</b>

593
00:40:53,325 --> 00:40:54,396
<b>Hey, why...</b>

594
00:40:54,595 --> 00:40:57,526
<b>You said you'd be right back. You kept me waiting for so long.</b>

595
00:40:57,526 --> 00:41:01,465
<b>My manager is kind of ill-tempered. Let's go.</b>

596
00:41:01,465 --> 00:41:02,706
<b>I'll buy you ice cream.</b>

597
00:41:02,805 --> 00:41:03,805
<b>For real?</b>

598
00:41:10,546 --> 00:41:12,046
<b>Thank you.</b>

599
00:41:20,916 --> 00:41:21,956
<b>Jang Woo.</b>

600
00:41:22,356 --> 00:41:23,356
<b>Yes?</b>

601
00:41:23,356 --> 00:41:26,296
<b>You graduated from Seoul National University. Why did you move back?</b>

602
00:41:26,956 --> 00:41:28,296
<b>- What a random question. - I know.</b>

603
00:41:28,296 --> 00:41:30,166
<b>I could never wrap my head around it.</b>

604
00:41:31,066 --> 00:41:33,635
<b>It's just nice to live where I was born and raised.</b>

605
00:41:33,635 --> 00:41:36,666
<b>Well, I like it here too.</b>

606
00:41:36,666 --> 00:41:38,465
<b>But don't most SNU graduates...</b>

607
00:41:38,465 --> 00:41:40,805
<b>get jobs at those big companies in Seoul?</b>

608
00:41:41,035 --> 00:41:42,535
<b>My parents suggested it.</b>

609
00:41:42,675 --> 00:41:45,845
<b>They told me to consider moving back and working at City Hall.</b>

610
00:41:47,146 --> 00:41:49,515
<b>I thought you were more ambitious than...</b>

611
00:41:49,515 --> 00:41:51,245
<b>- I dream small. - Yes, you do.</b>

612
00:41:51,816 --> 00:41:53,256
<b>But for me,</b>

613
00:41:54,416 --> 00:41:55,956
<b>it guarantees happiness.</b>

614
00:41:57,126 --> 00:41:58,756
<b>It guarantees happiness?</b>

615
00:41:58,756 --> 00:41:59,756
<b>Yes.</b>

616
00:42:01,825 --> 00:42:03,566
<b>So you're saying...</b>

617
00:42:03,566 --> 00:42:05,526
<b>you've happily been following the path...</b>

618
00:42:05,526 --> 00:42:07,796
<b>your parents decided for you so far, ignoring your own will?</b>

619
00:42:07,796 --> 00:42:09,336
<b>You studied very hard, and you were...</b>

620
00:42:09,336 --> 00:42:10,336
<b>always the best student...</b>

621
00:42:10,336 --> 00:42:12,236
<b>in the entire school throughout your school years.</b>

622
00:42:12,236 --> 00:42:13,706
<b>And you even got into Seoul National University.</b>

623
00:42:13,706 --> 00:42:16,146
<b>But instead of moving on to see the bigger world out there,</b>

624
00:42:16,146 --> 00:42:17,305
<b>you moved back home,</b>

625
00:42:17,305 --> 00:42:20,276
