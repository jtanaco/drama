00:37:12,896 --> 00:37:15,691
<b>Hundreds of millions of won
was deposited into his account.</b>

459
00:37:18,694 --> 00:37:19,903
<b>The thing is...</b>

460
00:37:20,696 --> 00:37:21,947
<b>Do you know who sent the money?</b>

461
00:37:23,448 --> 00:37:25,200
<b>Your wife,</b>

462
00:37:26,326 --> 00:37:28,620
<b>who's been bedridden
for the past 15 years.</b>

463
00:37:33,959 --> 00:37:37,462
<b>You're using her in every possible way,
aren't you?</b>

464
00:37:37,546 --> 00:37:38,630
<b>What are you talking about?</b>

465
00:37:38,714 --> 00:37:41,425
<b>Mr. Song, please be seated.</b>

466
00:37:43,677 --> 00:37:45,971
<b>Here's the finale I put together for you.</b>

467
00:38:06,616 --> 00:38:09,745
<b>Song Pil-jung, you're under arrest
for concealing Seo Jeong-hwa's corpse</b>

468
00:38:09,828 --> 00:38:11,329
<b>and destroying evidence.</b>

469
00:38:18,712 --> 00:38:22,132
<b>You have the right to remain silent
and the right to an attorney.</b>

470
00:38:22,382 --> 00:38:25,302
<b>You may refuse
to give an incriminating statement.</b>

471
00:38:25,719 --> 00:38:27,512
<b>Do you understand each of these rights?</b>

472
00:38:29,806 --> 00:38:30,766
<b>Take him.</b>

473
00:39:02,798 --> 00:39:05,467
<b>You really have a knack
for surprising others.</b>

474
00:39:06,051 --> 00:39:07,594
<b>You told me to just trust you and wait.</b>

475
00:39:08,386 --> 00:39:09,387
<b>You want to thank me?</b>

476
00:39:09,763 --> 00:39:11,807
<b>Then you know what to do, right?</b>

477
00:39:13,058 --> 00:39:14,434
<b>Hire Choong to get Issume</b>

478
00:39:15,811 --> 00:39:17,229
<b>back on the right track.</b>

479
00:39:30,575 --> 00:39:31,576
<b>Bravo.</b>

480
00:39:33,495 --> 00:39:34,871
<b>That was an amazing show.</b>

481
00:39:36,581 --> 00:39:38,416
<b>You don't look as upset
as I thought you would.</b>

482
00:39:39,334 --> 00:39:40,418
<b>I guess you enjoyed it.</b>

483
00:39:42,045 --> 00:39:43,547
<b>If the meeting took place,</b>

484
00:39:44,506 --> 00:39:46,174
<b>I wouldn't be
smiling at you like this now.</b>

485
00:39:47,008 --> 00:39:50,929
<b>That's why you should've selected
your business partner more carefully.</b>

486
00:39:51,346 --> 00:39:54,349
<b>The global business hunter, AP EON,</b>

487
00:39:55,308 --> 00:39:57,769
<b>got a little too greedy this time, right?</b>

488
00:39:58,728 --> 00:39:59,980
<b>But this won't be the end of me.</b>

489
00:40:00,063 --> 00:40:01,231
<b>Of course not.</b>

490
00:40:01,731 --> 00:40:04,651
<b>You'll find another target
and rip it off big-time.</b>

491
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:10,323
<b>I'm just doing my job.</b>

492
00:40:10,407 --> 00:40:11,700
<b>I know.</b>

493
00:40:12,492 --> 00:40:14,119
<b>Same here. I'm just doing my job.</b>

494
00:40:14,744 --> 00:40:16,121
<b>Had we not met through work...</b>

495
00:40:17,956 --> 00:40:18,999
<b>Here.</b>

496
00:40:19,082 --> 00:40:20,083
<b>Would things have been</b>

497
00:40:21,126 --> 00:40:22,377
<b>a little different?</b>

498
00:40:27,799 --> 00:40:31,803
<b>I only put up with you
because we met through work.</b>

499
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,051
<b>I can give you only 30 minutes.</b>

500
00:41:53,843 --> 00:41:56,012
<b>The lawyers from Song & Kim
must be rushing here now,</b>

501
00:41:57,138 --> 00:41:58,306
<b>so finish it before they come.</b>

502
00:42:18,994 --> 00:42:21,663
<b>Did I hire you to represent me, Ms. Jung?</b>

503
00:42:23,415 --> 00:42:26,876
<b>Acting up like this can get you
in trouble, Prosecutor Kwon.</b>

504
00:42:28,962 --> 00:42:31,673
<b>Concealing a dead body
and destroying evidence.</b>

505
00:42:36,511 --> 00:42:37,637
<b>Can you prove it?</b>

506
00:42:58,033 --> 00:42:59,034
<b>Are you saying this is me?</b>

507
00:43:01,578 --> 00:43:02,954
<b>Who'd believe that?</b>

508
00:43:04,330 --> 00:43:05,498
<b>The presiding judge?</b>

509
00:43:06,458 --> 00:43:07,542
<b>The prosecutor?</b>

510
00:43:11,296 --> 00:43:12,380
<b>What?</b>

511
00:43:12,922 --> 00:43:14,716
<b>Are you suddenly drawing a blank?</b>

512
00:43:14,799 --> 00:43:18,470
<b>You showed up at the shareholders' meeting
and caused a scene.</b>

513
00:43:29,564 --> 00:43:31,691
<b>Song Pil-jung got arrested too.</b>

514
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:34,569
<b>There's no way you can get out of this.</b>

515
00:43:35,570 --> 00:43:38,156
<b>The lawyer who always
solved problems like this for you</b>

516
00:43:38,907 --> 00:43:40,492
<b>is in the other room right now.</b>

517
00:43:46,289 --> 00:43:49,918
<b>Concealing a dead body
and destroying evidence.</b>

518
00:43:52,295 --> 00:43:55,215
<b>Are you repeating that because
you don't think I know what I'm here for?</b>

519
00:43:57,217 --> 00:43:58,218
<b>No.</b>

520
00:43:59,928 --> 00:44:01,971
<b>They're not the only charges
you're facing.</b>

521
00:44:03,431 --> 00:44:04,974
<b>There's more.</b>

522
00:44:06,476 --> 00:44:09,687
<b>That's why I keep saying that,
Mr. Song Pil-jung.</b>

523
00:44:10,105 --> 00:44:11,815
<b>The main cause of Seo Jeong-hwa's death</b>

524
00:44:11,898 --> 00:44:14,984
<b>was hematogenic shock
and traumatic subdural hemorrhage.</b>

525
00:44:15,068 --> 00:44:16,528
<b>POSTMORTEM REPORT</b>

526
00:44:16,611 --> 00:44:18,905
<b>So she bled to death
because of her head injury, right?</b>

527
00:44:18,988 --> 00:44:20,156
<b>But on the report...</b>

528
00:44:20,782 --> 00:44:23,201
<b>"The frenulum
and buccal mucosa were damaged.</b>

529
00:44:23,284 --> 00:44:25,411
<b>Petechial hemorrhage found
on the conjunctiva."</b>

530
00:44:27,038 --> 00:44:28,915
<b>That needs an explanation.</b>

531
00:44:28,998 --> 00:44:32,168
<b>The expert opinion is that such wounds
are formed when someone tries</b>

532
00:44:32,252 --> 00:44:33,586
<b>to cover your nose and mouth.</b>

533
00:44:34,087 --> 00:44:37,173
<b>It also proves that her blood was pumping</b>

534
00:44:37,590 --> 00:44:39,134
<b>when the pressure was applied.</b>

535
00:44:41,928 --> 00:44:45,682
<b>So when Seo Jeong-hwa
was dying from exsanguination,</b>

536
00:44:45,765 --> 00:44:48,351
<b>while she still was
conscious and breathing,</b>

537
00:44:48,476 --> 00:44:51,688
<b>someone covered her mouth and nose
to suffocate her?</b>

538
00:44:52,313 --> 00:44:53,356
<b>Who?</b>

539
00:44:54,858 --> 00:44:58,403
<b>It wasn't only Ha Chan-ho's DNA
that was found underneath her fingernails.</b>

540
00:44:58,903 --> 00:45:00,905
<b>There was an unidentified DNA sample.</b>

541
00:45:01,489 --> 00:45:02,699
<b>Son Bong-u's?</b>

542
00:45:03,241 --> 00:45:05,076
<b>No, not his.</b>

543
00:45:05,535 --> 00:45:07,537
<b>His numerous paternity tests</b>

544
00:45:08,121 --> 00:45:09,164
<b>made it easy to verify.</b>

545
00:45:11,749 --> 00:45:12,625
<b>Then...</b>

546
00:45:14,627 --> 00:45:15,920
<b>That leaves only one person.</b>

547
00:45:34,230 --> 00:45:37,442
<b><i>How dare you pinheads
make me sit in this chair?</i></b>

548
00:45:39,986 --> 00:45:41,571
<b>Murder,</b>

549
00:45:42,155 --> 00:45:44,073
<b>fleeing the scene of a crime,</b>

550
00:45:44,157 --> 00:45:46,576
<b>and ordering the disposal of a body.</b>

551
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:49,245
<b>If you're sentenced to prison,</b>

552
00:45:50,538 --> 00:45:52,707
<b>you might have to end your life there.</b>

553
00:45:54,751 --> 00:45:57,712
<b>It was all Mr. Song.</b>

554
00:45:58,046 --> 00:46:01,299
<b>My anger just got the best of me.
It was an accident.</b>

555
00:46:01,382 --> 00:46:05,345
<b>That ungrateful bitch
blackmailed me with my painting.</b>

556
00:46:06,095 --> 00:46:07,889
<b>How dare she!</b>

557
00:46:09,432 --> 00:46:12,268
<b>Then I guess it could be downplayed
as involuntary manslaughter.</b>

558
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:16,981
<b>Considering your age and social status,</b>

559
00:46:17,065 --> 00:46:18,650
<b>you might only get probation.</b>

560
00:46:20,944 --> 00:46:24,697
<b>Your lawyer is the one
who turned this into a murder case.</b>

561
00:46:29,661 --> 00:46:33,539
<b>I'm now offering you
a way out of this mess.</b>

562
00:46:33,957 --> 00:46:39,295
<b>What if she was still alive
when you thought she had died?</b>

563
00:46:41,506 --> 00:46:44,133
<b>What if it were Song Pil-jung</b>

564
00:46:45,551 --> 00:46:47,720
<b>and not you who killed Seo Jeong-hwa?</b>

565
00:46:53,059 --> 00:46:54,352
<b>Hey.</b>

566
00:46:55,353 --> 00:46:56,479
<b>Where are you right now?</b>

567
00:46:57,647 --> 00:46:58,606
<b>Right.</b>

568
00:47:00,024 --> 00:47:01,818
<b>You need to get over here.</b>

569
00:47:02,610 --> 00:47:03,611
<b>Yes.</b>

570
00:47:04,988 --> 00:47:05,863
<b>That's right.</b>

571
00:47:11,035 --> 00:47:13,705
<b>I'll handle this mess, so get out of here.</b>

572
00:47:22,797 --> 00:47:25,383
<b>This is the VIP suite at White Hotel.</b>

573
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:28,052
<b>Get over here quickly and bring the team.</b>

574
00:47:30,013 --> 00:47:31,514
<b>Mr. Song...</b>

575
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:38,438
<b>That's quite a story you concocted.</b>

576
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:41,816
<b><i>You of all people know
the difference in punishment between</i></b>

577
00:47:43,151 --> 00:47:44,277
<b>a cover-up and murder itself.</b>

578
00:47:45,278 --> 00:47:46,738
<b>Ms. Jung,</b>

579
00:47:48,281 --> 00:47:52,368
<b>I'm not at all like the punks
and idiots you normally deal with.</b>

580
00:47:53,369 --> 00:47:54,787
<b>I am not your match.</b>

581
00:47:56,331 --> 00:47:58,750
<b>Why do you think there's no evidence?</b>

582
00:47:58,833 --> 00:48:00,710
<b>Because I didn't do anything.</b>

583
00:48:05,089 --> 00:48:06,674
<b>It's funny, you know.</b>

584
00:48:07,842 --> 00:48:09,510
<b>When backed into a corner,</b>

585
00:48:09,594 --> 00:48:12,055
<b>a hotshot lawyer acts the same
as thugs on the street.</b>

586
00:48:12,138 --> 00:48:14,057
<b>Their first instinct
is to deny everything.</b>

587
00:48:14,515 --> 00:48:16,059
<b>-Watch your mouth!
-You...</b>

588
00:48:17,352 --> 00:48:19,270
<b>could've saved Seo Jeong-hwa.</b>

589
00:48:20,730 --> 00:48:22,106
<b>But you didn't.</b>

590
00:48:23,358 --> 00:48:24,692
<b>If you had let her be,</b>

591
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:27,111
<b>she would've died
from excessive blood loss.</b>

592
00:48:27,195 --> 00:48:28,946
<b>But that's not what you did.</b>

593
00:48:29,447 --> 00:48:33,743
<b>You chose to end her life
right then and there.</b>

594
00:48:35,745 --> 00:48:36,954
<b>Mr. Song...</b>

595
00:48:38,706 --> 00:48:40,041
<b>Help me.</b>

596
00:48:47,757 --> 00:48:49,634
<b>-Your evidence?
-Another set of DNA</b>

597
00:48:50,802 --> 00:48:55,181
<b>other than that of Ha Chan-ho's

598

<b>Who'd even imagine
it being a match to yours?</b>

599
00:49:06,609 --> 00:49:10,196
<b>No one thought to check
since you were never a suspect.</b>

600
00:49:10,613 --> 00:49:12,156
<b>That's why it came back as unidentified.</b>

601
00:49:13,491 --> 00:49:14,534
<b>However,</b>

602
00:49:20,790 --> 00:49:21,999
<b>I had it verified.</b>

603
00:49:23,793 --> 00:49:24,961
<b>This is hair from your razor.</b>

604
00:49:34,595 --> 00:49:35,638
<b>You will</b>

605
00:49:36,264 --> 00:49:37,473
<b>have to prove</b>

606
00:49:38,599 --> 00:49:40,726
<b>that I was even there to begin with.</b>

607
00:49:42,437 --> 00:49:45,440
<b>A DNA test can't be ordered
unless I become a suspect.</b>

608
00:49:46,732 --> 00:49:50,027
<b>One that's legal, I mean.</b>

609
00:49:53,781 --> 00:49:55,741
<b>I wonder if Chairman Son agrees.</b>

610
00:49:58,995 --> 00:50:01,122
