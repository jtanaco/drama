<b>THE KING: ETERNAL MONARCH</b>

2
00:00:11,351 --> 00:00:13,062
<b>EPISODE 3</b>

3
00:00:29,244 --> 00:00:32,831
<b>SIN-JAE...</b>

4
00:00:45,135 --> 00:00:47,638
<b>She should tell us
if she's going to be late.</b>

5
00:00:47,721 --> 00:00:48,597
<b>She's making us wait.</b>

6
00:00:50,307 --> 00:00:52,309
<b>The good parts like the drumsticks
and wings</b>

7
00:00:52,392 --> 00:00:55,395
<b>should be eaten while they're crispy
on the outside and soft on the inside.</b>

8
00:00:55,813 --> 00:00:58,273
<i><b>Sin-jae, just drink with Eun-sup today.</i></b>

9
00:00:58,774 --> 00:01:00,776
<i><b>I have something to take care of.</i></b>

10
00:01:02,277 --> 00:01:04,154
<b>Eat up. She says she can't come.</b>

11
00:01:06,657 --> 00:01:07,950
<b>Give us a bottle of soju, please.</b>

12
00:01:09,326 --> 00:01:10,536
<b>Hang on.</b>

13
00:01:10,744 --> 00:01:13,080
<b>Tae-eul really refused chicken and beer?</b>

14
00:01:14,706 --> 00:01:17,042
<b>What's going on?</b>

15
00:01:17,126 --> 00:01:18,418
<b>That's unbelievable.</b>

16
00:01:21,463 --> 00:01:22,506
<b>Lieutenant Jeong Tae-eul.</b>

17
00:01:24,967 --> 00:01:25,926
<b>I take you</b>

18
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:27,845
<b>to be my wife, the Queen.</b>

19
00:01:29,096 --> 00:01:30,722
<b>You just became the reason.</b>

20
00:01:31,765 --> 00:01:32,975
<b>The reason</b>

21
00:01:33,851 --> 00:01:35,144
<b>why I should stay in this world.</b>

22
00:01:38,605 --> 00:01:39,523
<b>Did you say "queen"?</b>

23
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:41,024
<b>Why?</b>

24
00:01:41,358 --> 00:01:43,610
<b>Did I look cool over the last few days?</b>

25
00:01:43,819 --> 00:01:46,655
<b>You've gone so mad
that your brain turned 360 degrees.</b>

26
00:01:46,905 --> 00:01:49,324
<b>If you are referring
to the angle of rotation,</b>

27
00:01:49,533 --> 00:01:50,701
<b>a 360-degree turn means
that my brain is in its original position.</b>

28
00:01:50,784 --> 00:01:53,495
<b>Oh, right. It should've been 180 degrees.</b>

29
00:01:54,121 --> 00:01:54,997
<b>So?</b>

30
00:01:55,497 --> 00:01:56,874
<b>Are you saying you really mean it?</b>

31
00:01:56,957 --> 00:01:58,959
<b>I've just given you a whole world.</b>

32
00:02:00,294 --> 00:02:03,046
<b>I don't know
how I can be any more sincere.</b>

33
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:05,257
<b>Oh, I just received a whole world.</b>

34
00:02:05,465 --> 00:02:07,593
<b>Right, I guess that's a good item</b>

35
00:02:07,676 --> 00:02:10,304
<b>to be giving back and forth
on the street while going to eat chicken.</b>

36
00:02:11,054 --> 00:02:12,472
<b>Are you crazy?</b>

37
00:02:17,311 --> 00:02:18,645
<b>Among real numbers,</b>

38
00:02:19,188 --> 00:02:20,397
<b>zero is my favorite.</b>

39
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,024
<b>You have the nature of that number.</b>

40
00:02:22,524 --> 00:02:23,442
<b>Do I?</b>

41
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:25,027
<b>Who would have known?</b>

42
00:02:25,652 --> 00:02:27,821
<b>Usually, a zero means
that there is nothing,</b>

43
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:30,699
<b>but it's actually
a number of absolute power.</b>

44
00:02:31,074 --> 00:02:33,911
<b>It can nullify any number
or take everything away from it.</b>

45
00:02:34,745 --> 00:02:37,206
<b>What makes money powerful
is not the number at the front,</b>

46
00:02:37,372 --> 00:02:39,041
<b>but the number of zeros behind it.</b>

47
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:42,836
<b>A number trapped
in a root symbol can escape</b>

48
00:02:43,754 --> 00:02:44,922
<b>under only two circumstances.</b>

49
00:02:45,005 --> 00:02:49,593
<b>They need to have a square root
or meet the powerful number, zero.</b>

50
00:02:51,428 --> 00:02:54,431
<b>You're always busy,
and you don't care much for me.</b>

51
00:02:55,224 --> 00:02:57,226
<b>Because of you, I'm powerless here,</b>

52
00:02:58,268 --> 00:02:59,436
<b>but it's fine.</b>

53
00:03:00,854 --> 00:03:04,191
<b>You are much more amazing
than I had imagined.</b>

54
00:03:04,691 --> 00:03:06,485
<b>And you're standing
in front of the root symbol</b>

55
00:03:07,569 --> 00:03:09,029
<b>I'm trapped in.</b>

56
00:03:12,658 --> 00:03:14,576
<b>You asked if I meant it. That's my answer.</b>

57
00:03:15,744 --> 00:03:16,620
<b>Do you believe me now?</b>

58
00:03:18,038 --> 00:03:19,206
<b>Believe what?</b>

59
00:03:19,665 --> 00:03:25,295
<b>I was asking if you really
mean to keep talking nonsense.</b>

60
00:03:27,881 --> 00:03:29,341
<b>You're as slow-witted</b>

61
00:03:30,175 --> 00:03:31,051
<b>as a bear.</b>

62
00:03:31,134 --> 00:03:32,302
<b>A bear?</b>

63
00:03:33,595 --> 00:03:34,721
<b>A bear?</b>

64
00:03:34,805 --> 00:03:37,724
<b>Oh, are you insulting me
since you have nothing to say?</b>

65
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:42,312
<b>Would it be okay for a king
to marry some random bear?</b>

66
00:03:42,396 --> 00:03:44,231
<b>They would oppose a marriage with a bear.</b>

67
00:03:44,314 --> 00:03:47,317
<b>The court and the cabinet
would all oppose strongly.</b>

68
00:03:48,652 --> 00:03:49,736
<b>All right, let's go.</b>

69
00:03:49,903 --> 00:03:50,862
<b>Let's go there.</b>

70
00:03:51,071 --> 00:03:53,115
<b>Take me to this
parallel universe of yours.</b>

71
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,784
<b>I'll go and proclaim myself
the mother of the people.</b>

72
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:58,036
<b>Lead the way. Which way is it?</b>

73
00:03:58,620 --> 00:03:59,788
<b>Come on, lead the way.</b>

74
00:04:25,731 --> 00:04:26,606
<b>What is it?</b>

75
00:04:27,065 --> 00:04:29,776
<b>Is this the wrong address
of the doorway to your world?</b>

76
00:04:30,819 --> 00:04:32,946
<b>If you have to recite
a spell or something, do it.</b>

77
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:34,406
<b>No need to feel embarrassed.</b>

78
00:04:35,198 --> 00:04:36,199
<b>I'm looking for the door.</b>

79
00:04:36,992 --> 00:04:39,578
<b>But it's not opening
since I came empty-handed.</b>

80
00:04:40,579 --> 00:04:43,332
<b>I guess we should've brought something.</b>

81
00:04:43,999 --> 00:04:45,375
<b>Are you kidding me?</b>

82
00:04:46,376 --> 00:04:47,753
<b>I know it's hard to believe,</b>

83
00:04:48,503 --> 00:04:51,506
<b>but there should be two obelisks there.</b>

84
00:04:52,591 --> 00:04:54,634
<b>Your lies are getting
more and more detailed.</b>

85
00:04:54,843 --> 00:04:57,304
<b>You mean the rocks in temples?</b>

86
00:04:57,929 --> 00:05:01,892
<b>Yes. The obelisks that stand between
the world of gods and humans.</b>

87
00:05:02,809 --> 00:05:06,146
<i><b>I heard a flute,
then came thunder and lightning,</i></b>

88
00:05:06,688 --> 00:05:08,982
<i><b>and two large obelisks appeared.</i></b>

89
00:05:10,901 --> 00:05:13,862
<b>But I guess I'm not allowed
to use that door today.</b>

90
00:05:21,244 --> 00:05:23,121
<b>Are you bored or something?</b>

91
00:05:23,622 --> 00:05:27,000
<b>Why did you come here
when you're not allowed?</b>

92
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:29,753
<b>I needed to check once anyway,</b>

93
00:05:30,504 --> 00:05:32,798
<b>but you told me to lead the way,
so it was a good chance.</b>

94
00:05:32,881 --> 00:05:36,343
<b>What did I do to deserve this?</b>

95
00:05:36,426 --> 00:05:40,180
<b>Why am I talking such nonsense with him
when it's freezing cold right now?</b>

96
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:42,641
<b>Mr. Kim Gae-ddong.</b>

97
00:05:44,851 --> 00:05:45,811
<b>Listen to me carefully.</b>

98
00:05:46,561 --> 00:05:49,815
<b>Your DNA results will probably
come out by tomorrow.</b>

99
00:05:50,857 --> 00:05:52,859
<b>It will be a relief
if we find a relative of yours,</b>

100
00:05:53,568 --> 00:05:54,778
<b>but even if we don't,</b>

101
00:05:55,529 --> 00:05:57,489
<b>this is as much as I can do to help.</b>

102
00:05:58,865 --> 00:06:01,660
<b>And stop calling Eun-sup. Got that?</b>

103
00:06:01,743 --> 00:06:02,786
<b>Did he agree to that?</b>

104
00:06:02,869 --> 00:06:05,831
<b>He's government property,
so he doesn't have a free will.</b>

105
00:06:05,914 --> 00:06:09,167
<b>Would Eun-sup and Yeong
really have the same DNA?</b>

106
00:06:10,085 --> 00:06:12,337
<b>Even twins don't have the exact same DNA.</b>

107
00:06:12,421 --> 00:06:14,423
<b>So even if you find a relative
based on my DNA,</b>

108
00:06:15,298 --> 00:06:16,675
<b>they won't be my real family.</b>

109
00:06:18,176 --> 00:06:21,805
<b>Why would a relative not be your family?</b>

110
00:06:22,889 --> 00:06:26,810
<b>My mother and father passed away
a long time ago.</b>

111
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,980
<b>Ironically, the first duty of a king</b>

112
00:06:30,063 --> 00:06:32,190
<b>is carrying out
the funeral of the former king.</b>

113
00:06:33,108 --> 00:06:34,151
<b>It was when I was eight.</b>

114
00:06:42,993 --> 00:06:43,910
<b>That's a long time ago.</b>

115
00:06:45,245 --> 00:06:46,204
<b>Shall we go now?</b>

116
00:07:36,379 --> 00:07:37,506
<b>What's his name?</b>

117
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:40,592
<b>You're an only child
but you call him your brother.</b>

118
00:07:42,135 --> 00:07:43,386
<b>What's your name, then?</b>

119
00:07:44,221 --> 00:07:46,932
<b>Why ask another guy's name
when you don't even know yours?</b>

120
00:07:47,098 --> 00:07:48,183
<b>I never said I don't know.</b>

121
00:07:48,808 --> 00:07:50,435
<b>I said you can't say my name
even if I tell you.</b>

122
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:53,021
<b>Are you the poet Kim So-wol?</b>

123
00:07:54,064 --> 00:07:55,023
<b>Who's Kim So-wol?</b>

124
00:07:56,107 --> 00:07:57,651
<b>Wow, you're really good at pretending.</b>

125
00:07:59,236 --> 00:08:03,156
<b>I won't "finish the last words
I had in my heart,"</b>

126
00:08:03,406 --> 00:08:05,408
<b>so stop being nosy about my life.</b>

127
00:08:11,581 --> 00:08:14,584
<b>Is that guy
really a huge part of your life?</b>

128
00:08:15,669 --> 00:08:16,545
<b>Hey!</b>

129
00:08:26,429 --> 00:08:27,889
<b>The five tenets of Taekwondo are</b>

130
00:08:27,973 --> 00:08:31,685
<b>courtesy, perseverance, integrity,
self-control, and indomitable spirit.</b>

131
00:08:32,269 --> 00:08:34,604
<b>For people without black belts,
the forms are <i>Taeguk</i> 1 to 8.</b>

132
00:08:34,688 --> 00:08:37,440
<b>For people with black belts,
the forms are from <i>Koryo</i> to <i>Ilyeo</i>.</b>

133
00:08:37,524 --> 00:08:38,817
<b>You're the Taekwondo master?</b>

134
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:42,404
<b>As you can see, the road of learning
is a long and rough unpaved road.</b>

135
00:08:42,487 --> 00:08:44,072
<b>But there is no need to worry.</b>

136
00:08:44,155 --> 00:08:45,991
<b>And I'll accompany you
to the end of that road,</b>

137
00:08:46,074 --> 00:08:48,076
<b>so you'll show courtesy,
have perseverance,</b>

138
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:50,870
<b>integrity, and self-control,
and eventually have an indomitable spirit.</b>

139
00:08:50,954 --> 00:08:53,123
<b>-Is that black-belt real?
-Don't talk so casually to me.</b>

140
00:08:53,832 --> 00:08:55,000
<b>JEONG TAE-EUL</b>

141
00:08:56,835 --> 00:08:58,086
<b>I thought you had perseverance.</b>

142
00:09:01,006 --> 00:09:02,340
<b>Don't lower your guard.</b>

143
00:09:03,008 --> 00:09:05,927
<b>You're the one who needs
to learn perseverance, not me.</b>

144
00:09:07,596 --> 00:09:09,973
<b>It'll be a waste of money
to just lie there on the floor.</b>

145
00:09:10,056 --> 00:09:12,642
<b>Get up. You will learn breakfalls first.</b>

146
00:09:12,726 --> 00:09:14,227
<b>Let's just skip that.</b>

147
00:09:15,687 --> 00:09:17,272
<b>I fell thousands of times before.</b>

148
00:09:17,647 --> 00:09:20,275
<b>And you'll keep falling in the future,</b>

149
00:09:20,567 --> 00:09:23,320
<b>so I'll teach you how to fall safely.</b>

150
00:09:44,215 --> 00:09:45,091
<b>Hey.</b>

151
00:09:46,092 --> 00:09:48,053
<b>Hey, that's prejudice.</b>

152
00:09:48,136 --> 00:09:51,056

<b>You really are handsome.</b>

155
00:10:01,191 --> 00:10:03,193
<b>You don't have an ID, do you?</b>

156
00:10:04,486 --> 00:10:05,612
<b>Hey.</b>

157
00:10:06,237 --> 00:10:07,530
<b>Are you trying to attack me?</b>

158
00:10:48,113 --> 00:10:49,781
<b>Your resume states</b>

<b>that your family is living

<b>Well, it hasn't been long

<b>I only meet a childhood friend often.</b>

168

<b>Then you won't have many people

00:11:20,854 --> 00:11:21,688

<b>You've applied for 4 years,

<b>You've been watching me?</b>

176
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:36,494

184
00:12:02,812 --> 00:12:04,397
<b>Sorry about that.</b>

185

00:14:09,105 --> 00:14:11,733
<b>Aren't you a member of our party,

<b>But all you're doing

<b>Mr. Park, if this position can be kept

230
00:14:51,856 --> 00:14:53,107
<b>Look here, Prime Minister!</b>

231
00:14:54,067 --> 00:14:55,068
<b>COREA PARTY</b>

232
00:14:56,486 --> 00:14:59,489
<b>His Majesty has been paying taxes

233

<b>Don't you think we should

<b>There are articles being written every day</b>

<b>and low-income earners.</b>

237
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:13,044
<b>Of course, postponing the salary raise
just once won't narrow the gap.</b>

<b>that our party's values

<b>What is it?</b>

250
00:16:05,263 --> 00:16:08,391
<b>I just heard from Administration that

<b>Again?</b>

252
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:13,021
<b>You didn't say anything

253
00:16:13,104 --> 00:16:15,773
<b>I didn't. If I wanted to,
I would've gone to the office right away.</b>

<b>-Why would I be here telling you about it?
-Good job.</b>

255
00:16:18,192 --> 00:16:21,529
<b>Do you think his mother

<b>This is just unbelievable!</b>

00:16:23,031 --> 00:16:26,784
<b>His mother grew up a bit spoiled

<b>She has no knowledge of the world.</b>

259
00:16:28,536 --> 00:16:31,330
<b>People enjoy gambling even

260
00:16:31,414 --> 00:16:32,832
<b>It's so irritating.</b>

261
00:16:32,915 --> 00:16:35,334
<b>What do we do about poor Sin-jae?</b>

262
00:16:41,924 --> 00:16:44,594

<b>Right, I lived in an upscale neighborhood.</b>

358

<b>Of course.</b>

360
00:21:59,992 --> 00:22:01,702
<b>I lived in Area B

362

363
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,085
<b>Did you buy your own house?</b>

364
00:22:09,168 --> 00:22:11,629

373
00:22:32,608 --> 00:22:34,443

374
00:22:34,693 --> 00:22:36,529
<b>I bet the government
doesn't give you this much.</b>

<b>Busan is the cultural capital.</b>

597

<b>The central government is in Seoul.</b>

<b>It's the political capital,

00:35:59,927 --> 00:36:01,387
<b>We're always at the brink of war.</b>

607
00:36:02,221 --> 00:36:04,390
<b>So my grandfather, King Haejong,</b>

608
00:36:04,557 --> 00:36:07,101
<b>announced a constitutional monarchy
in 1945,</b>

609

<i><b>leaving the parliament in Seoul
and moving the palace to Busan.</i></b>

610
00:36:12,148 --> 00:36:13,482
<i><b>That decision was made to show</i></b>

611

<i><b>the royal court's resolution to stand
at the front to face our enemies first.</i></b>

612
00:36:17,778 --> 00:36:18,863
<i><b>That's why</i></b>

<i><b>the statue of Admiral Yi Sun-Sin
is in Busan in my world.</i></b>

614
00:36:22,658 --> 00:36:24,243
<i><b>The statue shows</i></b>

615
00:36:25,077 --> 00:36:28,914
<i><b>that no one can cross our Kingdom's seas

<b>I guess you got nothing on my DNA results.</b>

618

<b>But you still can't really believe me,</b>

619
00:36:43,929 --> 00:36:44,972
<b>right?</b>

620
00:36:48,809 --> 00:36:50,394
<b>So who do you think I am?</b>

621
00:36:51,687 --> 00:36:54,273
<b>There is no information at all
about me in this world.</b>

622
00:37:02,782 --> 00:37:04,033
<b>I hope your earth</b>

624
00:37:20,925 --> 00:37:25,429
<b>I'm going to use the bathroom and pay,

625
00:37:48,703 --> 00:37:49,870
<b>What is...</b>

626
00:38:01,507 --> 00:38:02,800
<b>No wonder.</b>

627
00:38:03,384 --> 00:38:05,302
<b>I thought it was too expensive.</b>

628
00:38:06,262 --> 00:38:07,722
<b>When did you get that?</b>

629
00:38:08,222 --> 00:38:09,932

630

<b>A King? And the stuff about the capital?</b>

633

<b>You're a total nutjob.</b>

634
00:38:23,404 --> 00:38:25,281
<b>This is so ridiculous.</b>

635
00:38:25,948 --> 00:38:27,575
<b>I've been missing you for 25 years--</b>

<b>-Shut up!
-You'll be beheaded for interrupting.</b>

<b>My gosh.</b>

640
00:38:46,802 --> 00:38:48,012
<b>Why are you following me?</b>

641
00:38:48,596 --> 00:38:49,805
<b>I'm not following you.</b>

642
00:38:51,098 --> 00:38:53,517
<b>I'm going to Maximus to say goodnight.</b>

643
00:39:11,535 --> 00:39:14,914
<b>But why won't it eat
the carrots I give it?</b>

644
00:39:15,122 --> 00:39:17,708
<b>Do Senior Seventh Rank officials

645
00:39:17,792 --> 00:39:19,084

647
00:39:32,097 --> 00:39:33,224

648
00:39:33,474 --> 00:39:35,017
<b>Keep it in your mouth,

649
00:39:38,604 --> 00:39:39,897
<b>That's a king's order.</b>

650
00:40:06,215 --> 00:40:07,091
<i><b>What?</i></b>

651
00:40:08,843 --> 00:40:10,511
<b>Are you wondering
why I always look at this?</b>

652
00:40:10,886 --> 00:40:11,887
<b>Yes.</b>

653
00:40:12,638 --> 00:40:14,598
<b>Prince Buyeong performed the autopsy.</b>

654
00:40:15,558 --> 00:40:19,395
<b>The fingerprints and DNA
all matched with traitor Lee Lim.</b>

655
00:40:20,187 --> 00:40:22,356
<b>I know. I know that, but...</b>

656
00:40:23,732 --> 00:40:25,985
<b>The body is like Lee Lim,</b>

657
00:40:26,068 --> 00:40:28,654
<b>but it's like an unknown symbol
that's not really him.</b>

658
00:40:31,615 --> 00:40:33,576
<b>Sometimes,
symbols of mathematics or science</b>

659
00:40:34,076 --> 00:40:36,620
<b>are useful when understanding
a certain phenomenon.</b>

660
00:40:36,704 --> 00:40:40,499
<b>For example, the plus sign
doesn't have any meaning by itself,</b>

661
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:43,919
<b>since it's a symbol that means
adding something.</b>

662
00:40:45,713 --> 00:40:46,964
<b>So I have a theory</b>

663
00:40:48,424 --> 00:40:51,927
<b>that this body is a symbol
that Lee Lim used</b>

664
00:40:53,178 --> 00:40:55,014
<b>to show that he died.</b>

665
00:40:56,724 --> 00:40:58,475
<b>But then there would be a bigger question.</b>

666
00:40:59,810 --> 00:41:01,270
<b>What is this body,</b>

667
00:41:02,605 --> 00:41:04,315
<b>and how does it have the same DNA?</b>

668
00:41:06,609 --> 00:41:07,943
<b>What was added</b>

669
00:41:10,738 --> 00:41:12,197
<b>to the real traitor Lee Lim?</b>

670
00:41:16,327 --> 00:41:17,661
<b>Where are you?</b>

671
00:41:20,247 --> 00:41:21,457
<b>What has been</b>

672
00:41:22,833 --> 00:41:24,501
<b>added to you, Your Majesty?</b>

673
00:43:28,584 --> 00:43:30,377
<b>I told you to just pretend.</b>

674
00:43:30,461 --> 00:43:32,004
<b>Don't actually sell food here.</b>

675
00:43:33,922 --> 00:43:35,424
<b>Careful what you say.</b>

676
00:43:35,507 --> 00:43:36,884
<b>Those kids have ears too, you know.</b>

677
00:43:40,387 --> 00:43:41,388
<b>Hey, kids.</b>

678
00:43:42,139 --> 00:43:43,599
<b>Move. That's my seat.</b>

679
00:43:43,682 --> 00:43:46,226
<b>I heard that if you sit here,
you can become a Prime Minister.</b>

680
00:43:47,227 --> 00:43:49,229
<b>I succeeded because it was me.</b>

681
00:43:49,313 --> 00:43:50,814

<b>She's the King's girlfriend.</b>

684

685
00:43:58,030 --> 00:44:00,157
<b>You can stay and play,

-Okay.</b>

<b>Didn't you feel that?</b>

760
00:50:33,758 --> 00:50:35,093
<b>Why would time stop?</b>

761
00:50:35,427 --> 00:50:38,346
<b>-Did you decide to get weirder?
-Everything stopped except for me.</b>

762
00:50:38,430 --> 00:50:39,639
<b>Why not you?</b>

763
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:45,645
<b>It's a theory, but I think it might be
a side effect of using that door.</b>

764
00:50:47,397 --> 00:50:48,356
<b>But</b>

765
00:50:49,316 --> 00:50:50,233
<b>thanks to that,</b>

766
00:50:50,901 --> 00:50:52,444
<b>I saw something beautiful.</b>

767
00:50:53,820 --> 00:50:55,947
<b>Okay, enjoy yourself.</b>

768
00:50:56,531 --> 00:50:58,450
<b>And please watch my car too.</b>

769
00:50:59,618 --> 00:51:00,494
<b>Bye.</b>

770
00:51:13,548 --> 00:51:16,301
<b>I unintentionally got a car.</b>

771
00:51:29,064 --> 00:51:30,690
<b>EOSU BOOKSTORE</b>

772
00:51:57,509 --> 00:51:59,678
<b>THE KING LEFT THE PALACE</b>

773
00:52:02,681 --> 00:52:03,765
<b>Your Highness.</b>

774
00:52:07,102 --> 00:52:08,311
<b>It's been a long time.</b>

775
00:52:08,812 --> 00:52:10,897
<b>The world is peaceful,</b>

776
00:52:12,107 --> 00:52:14,776
<b>so I couldn't feel the time passing by.</b>

777
00:52:15,777 --> 00:52:18,321
<b>I guess there are many customers
in the book shop.</b>

778
00:52:18,655 --> 00:52:22,951
<b>Yes, they always come at the agreed time.</b>

779
00:53:24,679 --> 00:53:25,722
<i><b>On that day...</i></b>

780
00:53:27,641 --> 00:53:29,976
<i><b>I should have realized it once I found out</i></b>

781
00:53:31,144 --> 00:53:32,479
<i><b>that Manpasikjeok is the key.</i></b>

782
00:53:36,191 --> 00:53:38,777
<i><b>That traitor Lee Lim has
the other half of the Manpasikjeok.</i></b>

783
00:53:39,903 --> 00:53:41,738
<i><b>And that he is probably alive</i></b>

784

<i><b>moving back and forth
from the two parallel worlds.</i></b>

785
00:53:47,243 --> 00:53:48,578
<i><b>I should have known</i></b>

786
00:53:51,206 --> 00:53:54,292
<i><b>before seeing the beauty
I have been looking for.</i></b>

787
00:53:57,462 --> 00:53:59,339
<i><b>I should have known that
Manpasikjeok is the key</i></b>

788
00:54:00,965 --> 00:54:02,592
<i><b>and the lock.</i></b>

789
00:54:06,388 --> 00:54:07,389
<b>Have you all been well?</b>

790
00:54:08,056 --> 00:54:09,724
<b>-Your Highness!
-Your Highness!</b>

791
00:54:17,482 --> 00:54:18,858
<b>Listen up, everyone.</b>

792
00:54:22,529 --> 00:54:24,656
<b>We finally got the results
from the Forensics team.</b>

793
00:54:26,116 --> 00:54:30,286
<b>They found the blood of both the killer
and the victim on the crowbar.</b>

794
00:54:30,370 --> 00:54:32,122
<b>We can finish up the case on Kim Bok-man.</b>

795
00:54:32,288 --> 00:54:34,749
<b>Sin-jae,
you write the investigation report.</b>

796
00:54:34,999 --> 00:54:36,626
<b>Good job, good job.</b>

797
00:54:36,751 --> 00:54:38,044
<b>Great job, everyone.</b>

798
00:54:38,128 --> 00:54:39,003
<b>Thank you, sir.</b>

799
00:54:39,754 --> 00:54:41,881
<b>"Good job"? That's it?</b>

800
00:54:42,006 --> 00:54:44,634
<b>-We should have an after-work party today.
-My gosh.</b>

801
00:54:44,718 --> 00:54:46,177
<b>But Chief...</b>

802
00:54:46,261 --> 00:54:47,595
<b>-Oh, please.
-Oh, please.</b>

803
00:54:48,555 --> 00:54:51,266
<b>Kim Bok-man is strongly denying it,</b>

804
00:54:51,349 --> 00:54:54,352
<b>but everything's adding up perfectly.
Don't you think so?</b>

805
00:54:55,603 --> 00:54:57,897
<b>Among the guys
who strongly denied their crimes,</b>

806
00:54:57,981 --> 00:54:59,190
<b>nobody was innocent.</b>

807
00:54:59,274 --> 00:55:01,192
<b>They all killed someone
and just denied it.</b>

808
00:55:01,276 --> 00:55:03,695
<b>-We have the weapon and a clear motive.
-Right.</b>

809
00:55:03,778 --> 00:55:05,613
<b>And the victim's body was in his trunk.</b>

810
00:55:05,697 --> 00:55:08,908
<b>Which out of those three is bothering you?</b>

811
00:55:09,909 --> 00:55:12,954
<b>I'm not saying there's something specific.</b>

812
00:55:13,913 --> 00:55:15,999
<b>It just feels like someone
planned all this.</b>

813
00:55:17,417 --> 00:55:18,460
<b>My gosh.</b>

814
00:55:27,469 --> 00:55:29,846
<b>Why are you looking at me?
She's looking at me.</b>

815
00:55:32,098 --> 00:55:34,851
<b>Buzz, buzz. 2019 Kang Sin-jae.</b>

816
00:55:35,018 --> 00:55:36,603
<b>Is it the same over there?</b>

817
00:55:36,686 --> 00:55:39,397
<b>Do you have after-work parties
without investigating everything?</b>

818
00:55:39,981 --> 00:55:43,735
<b>It's been 20 years,
so I guess some things would've changed.</b>

819
00:55:43,818 --> 00:55:45,904
<b>It's Cho Jin-woong from <i>Signal</i>!</b>

820
00:55:45,987 --> 00:55:48,698
<b>She's talking nonsense while
looking at me, and he keeps playing along.</b>

821
00:55:48,782 --> 00:55:50,617
<b>You little... Hey.</b>

822
00:55:51,951 --> 00:55:52,869
<b>You little...</b>

823
00:55:54,496 --> 00:55:55,455
<b>Good job.</b>

824
00:56:28,071 --> 00:56:30,448
<i><b>The number you have called is unavailable.</i></b>

825
00:56:31,074 --> 00:56:32,450
<b>The victim's wife isn't picking up.</b>

826
00:56:33,117 --> 00:56:34,911
<b>I guess she ran away from the loan sharks.</b>

827
00:56:36,371 --> 00:56:37,539
<b>Are you going to keep digging?</b>

828
00:56:38,081 --> 00:56:39,624
<b>Kim Bok-man is garbage anyway.</b>

829
00:56:39,707 --> 00:56:42,502
<b>We can put him behind bars for longer,
so why go through all the trouble?</b>

830
00:56:42,585 --> 00:56:44,045
<b>A detective shouldn't talk like that.</b>

831
00:56:44,254 --> 00:56:46,130
<b>You came with me anyway</b>

832
00:56:46,214 --> 00:56:48,091
<b>so we can make sure
he isn't falsely accused.</b>

833
00:56:48,174 --> 00:56:49,926
<b>I'm only making sure
you don't feel wronged.</b>

834
00:56:52,929 --> 00:56:55,306
<b>If you're going to keep digging,
trust the evidence we found.</b>

835
00:56:55,890 --> 00:56:59,602
<b>If it really was planned by someone,
that evidence will point to something.</b>

836
00:57:02,897 --> 00:57:04,983
<b>I doubt it'll have anything useful,
but I took this just in case.</b>

837
00:57:05,066 --> 00:57:06,818
<b>Check this.</b>

838
00:57:13,783 --> 00:57:16,494
<b>Wow, 2019 Kang Sin-jae.</b>

839
00:57:18,872 --> 00:57:21,332
<b>Hey, Kang Sin-jae from 11th grade,
Class 3, Number 5!</b>

840
00:57:27,088 --> 00:57:28,506
<b>What's going on today?</b>

841
00:57:29,090 --> 00:57:30,967
<b>The past keeps calling me today.</b>

842
00:57:36,055 --> 00:57:37,891
<b>Hey, it's been such a long time.</b>

843
00:57:38,683 --> 00:57:40,268
<b>Has it been three years?</b>

844
00:57:41,269 --> 00:57:43,271
<b>What are you doing
in such a dangerous neighborhood?</b>

845
00:57:45,023 --> 00:57:46,190
<b>Is he your old teacher?</b>

846
00:57:46,858 --> 00:57:48,192
<b>No, my old classmate.</b>

847
00:57:49,027 --> 00:57:51,613
<b>You should go. He might kill me.</b>

848
00:57:52,113 --> 00:57:53,823
<b>I sent him to jail three years ago.</b>

849
00:57:55,783 --> 00:57:59,370
<b>Your friend must've succeeded
after getting released from jail.</b>

850
00:57:59,996 --> 00:58:01,122
<b>He has a large group.</b>

851
00:58:01,205 --> 00:58:03,875
<b>Yeah, and I only have you.</b>

852
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:07,837
<b>Sometimes I think I should've
just stayed on that path.</b>

853
00:58:09,130 --> 00:58:10,089
<b>You can rely on me.</b>

854
00:58:12,550 --> 00:58:15,136
<b>You're in Violent Crimes Squad Three now.</b>

855
00:58:18,139 --> 00:58:20,391
<b>Hey, misters.</b>

856
00:58:20,475 --> 00:58:23,728
<b>You can't just jaywalk like that.</b>

857
00:58:25,188 --> 00:58:26,230
<b>Is she your girlfriend?</b>

858
00:58:28,399 --> 00:58:29,525
<b>Oh, she's a detective.</b>

859
00:58:30,109 --> 00:58:33,321
<b>Female detectives are so scary these days.</b>

860
00:58:33,488 --> 00:58:35,031
<b>Maybe I should change my job.</b>

861
00:58:35,114 --> 00:58:36,491
<b>Should I become a househusband?</b>

862
00:58:38,826 --> 00:58:40,495
<b>You two have some nerve coming here.</b>

863
00:58:40,578 --> 00:58:41,496
<b>It's actually three people.</b>

864
00:58:43,373 --> 00:58:45,208
<b>Hey! How did you get here?</b>

865
00:58:45,291 --> 00:58:47,752
<b>By car. Your Senior Fifth Rank official.</b>

866
00:58:48,711 --> 00:58:50,338
<b>-It was pretty speedy.
-What?</b>

867
00:58:53,341 --> 00:58:55,301
<b>We'll talk about that later.</b>

868
00:58:56,010 --> 00:58:58,054
<b>So how are you going to do this?</b>

869
00:58:58,429 --> 00:58:59,472
<b>Are you three teaming up?</b>

870
00:59:01,391 --> 00:59:02,684
<b>I'm just going to watch.</b>

871
00:59:03,226 --> 00:59:04,727
<b>The governmental authority
can take care of it.</b>

872
00:59:04,811 --> 00:59:06,854
<b>Why are you confusing us?</b>

873
00:59:07,647 --> 00:59:11,693
<b>Guys, make sure to beat up Number 5
Kang Sin-jae from Class 3 properly.</b>

874
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:13,194
<b>I owe him a lot.</b>

875
00:59:42,348 --> 00:59:44,058
<i><b>Why did you become a cop?</i></b>

876
00:59:44,642 --> 00:59:46,519
<i><b>It's dangerous to be a cop.</i></b>

877
00:59:47,687 --> 00:59:50,982
<i><b>Not everyone in the world can be brave.</i></b>

878
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:53,776
<i><b>So I decided to become brave.</i></b>

879
01:00:08,624 --> 01:00:10,668
<b>Hey! Get this jerk first!</b>

880
01:00:17,133 --> 01:00:18,509
<b>You really shouldn't do that.</b>

881
01:00:19,510 --> 01:00:20,845
<b>I hate it</b>

882
01:00:22,388 --> 01:00:23,556
<b>when people touch me.</b>

883
01:00:44,660 --> 01:00:47,371
<b>I told you, didn't I? I worked out a lot.</b>

884
01:00:48,122 --> 01:00:50,833
<b>-I'm glad I was able to prove it.
-Are you kidding me?</b>

885
01:00:50,917 --> 01:00:53,419
<b>Are you mad? How could you drive that?
Do you even have a license?</b>

886
01:00:53,503 --> 01:00:54,962
<b>The King doesn't have a license.</b>

887
01:00:55,546 --> 01:00:57,840
<b>-I'm the one who issues--
-You crazy...</b>

888
01:01:00,718 --> 01:01:02,345
<b>How did you know I was here?</b>

889
01:01:02,512 --> 01:01:03,930
<b>I went to the station to see you,</b>

890
01:01:04,639 --> 01:01:06,641
<b>and they said you were out.
I looked at your GPS</b>

891
01:01:06,891 --> 01:01:08,726
<b>and this place was searched
several times, so I came here.</b>

892
01:01:08,810 --> 01:01:10,311
<b>It's a relief I met you here.</b>

893
01:01:10,436 --> 01:01:12,188
<b>I nearly had to go to the forensics.</b>

894
01:01:15,024 --> 01:01:16,025
<b>Over here.</b>

895
01:01:21,030 --> 01:01:23,199
<b>I just got some random stuff.
Put on a bandage while we eat.</b>

896
01:01:23,741 --> 01:01:24,784
<b>So we meet again.</b>

897
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:29,080
<b>Are you feeling all right?
It looked like you got beat up badly.</b>

898
01:01:29,163 --> 01:01:32,375
<b>What are you doing here?
You seemed to be on their side.</b>

899
01:01:32,458 --> 01:01:33,876
<b>What's with the two of you?</b>

900
01:01:34,001 --> 01:01:36,003
<b>Let's continue after we eat.</b>

901
01:01:36,838 --> 01:01:39,215
<b>Gosh, why didn't you put some thought
into what you're buying?</b>

902
01:01:39,298 --> 01:01:41,342
<b>There are waterproof bandages these days.</b>

903
01:01:41,551 --> 01:01:42,969
<b>They are expensive.</b>

904
01:01:43,219 --> 01:01:46,055
<b>And why did you only get one?</b>

905
01:01:46,264 --> 01:01:47,682
<b>The bigger one is mine, okay?</b>

906
01:01:47,807 --> 01:01:50,726
<b>Focus on dividing it equally.
Don't think about eating the bigger half.</b>

907
01:01:50,810 --> 01:01:53,146
<b>You could've just bought two.
There are two people, you know.</b>

908
01:01:55,523 --> 01:01:56,858
<i><b>It's actually three people.</i></b>

909
01:02:16,377 --> 01:02:18,588
<b>-I'll pay for this.

911
01:02:20,423 --> 01:02:21,257
<b>Pay for mine.</b>

912
01:02:21,924 --> 01:02:23,718
<b>I need that hospitality more than her.</b>

913
01:02:26,554 --> 01:02:28,306
<b>You really are a funny dude.</b>

914
01:02:28,806 --> 01:02:30,975
<b>He really doesn't hold grudges.</b>

915
01:02:31,642 --> 01:02:33,477
<b>He doesn't keep anything to himself.</b>

916
01:02:34,145 --> 01:02:37,607
<b>I'll head out first. Come with me.
Where did you park my car?</b>

917
01:02:37,690 --> 01:02:40,234
<b>Head to the station. And you come with me.</b>

918
01:02:41,068 --> 01:02:41,986

919
01:02:45,865 --> 01:02:47,074
<b>Did you enjoy it?</b>

920
01:02:48,701 --> 01:02:49,577
<b>Come out. Hurry.</b>

921
01:02:52,705 --> 01:02:55,249
<b>Are you going to be late today?</b>

922
01:02:58,002 --> 01:02:59,128
<b>Why are you asking?</b>

923
01:02:59,921 --> 01:03:01,047
<b>I should say goodbye.</b>

924
01:03:02,215 --> 01:03:03,716
<b>I might have to wait for you.</b>

925
01:03:05,801 --> 01:03:06,844
<b>Where are you going?</b>

926
01:03:07,762 --> 01:03:08,679
<b>Back to my world.</b>

927
01:03:10,389 --> 01:03:13,059
<b>I'm the King of my country.
I left the palace empty for too long.</b>

928
01:03:14,852 --> 01:03:17,688
<b>And you didn't share that
obelisk-shaped ice cream with me.</b>

929
01:03:20,733 --> 01:03:22,276
<b>You said it's a parallel universe.</b>

930
01:03:22,360 --> 01:03:24,445
<b>You make it sound as if you're going
to a different neighborhood.</b>

931
01:03:24,528 --> 01:03:27,073
<b>Did you finally remember the spell?</b>

932
01:03:28,032 --> 01:03:30,326
<b>It's not that I didn't know
how to go back.</b>

933
01:03:31,369 --> 01:03:32,912
<b>I just didn't want to go.</b>

934
01:03:36,999 --> 01:03:39,585
<b>All right, then.
Goodbye. I'm gonna be late.</b>

935
01:04:03,567 --> 01:04:06,237
<b>I'll pay you back next time. Bye.</b>

936
01:04:11,158 --> 01:04:12,702
<b>That horse is yours, right?</b>

937
01:04:15,246 --> 01:04:16,872
<b>What's the company that made the harness?</b>

938
01:04:17,164 --> 01:04:18,082
<b>Give me their number.</b>

939
01:04:18,666 --> 01:04:19,917
<b>That's an interesting question.</b>

940
01:04:20,918 --> 01:04:22,670
<b>Why? Is it nice?</b>

941
01:04:22,753 --> 01:04:24,213
<b>What's the company?</b>

942
01:04:24,338 --> 01:04:27,258
<b>I don't know.
I was never curious about it.</b>

943
01:04:27,341 --> 01:04:30,594
<b>And you won't be able to reach them
even if I knew.</b>

944
01:04:30,678 --> 01:04:31,929
<b>Stop the nonsense.</b>

945
01:04:34,140 --> 01:04:36,058
<b>What logo is this?</b>

946
01:04:36,142 --> 01:04:37,560
<b>I'm asking because I saw it before.</b>

947
01:04:38,227 --> 01:04:39,770
<b>-Where?
-You better be honest.</b>

948
01:04:39,937 --> 01:04:41,230
<b>I didn't see it at some party.</b>

949
01:04:41,314 --> 01:04:43,858
<b>Wherever you think saw it,
you're mistaken.</b>

950
01:04:44,567 --> 01:04:46,027
<b>That logo is used</b>

951
01:04:46,402 --> 01:04:48,863
<b>in a different country in another world.
It's not used here.</b>

952
01:04:51,657 --> 01:04:52,742
<b>Oh, really?</b>

953
01:04:53,909 --> 01:04:55,119
<b>Then how do you know about it?</b>

954
01:04:55,202 --> 01:04:57,330
<b>I'm the King of that country,
the Kingdom of Corea.</b>

955
01:05:00,958 --> 01:05:02,460
<b>He's a liberal arts person too.</b>

956

<b>How long will it take to analyze this?</b>

957
01:05:06,422 --> 01:05:07,715
<b>It's urgent.</b>

958
01:05:07,798 --> 01:05:10,259
<b>Extremely urgent.</b>

959
01:05:10,760 --> 01:05:12,136
<b>Everything is urgent here.</b>

960
01:05:12,803 --> 01:05:15,473
<b>-It'll take two weeks minimum, I guess.
-Wait, this is--</b>

961
01:05:15,556 --> 01:05:18,684
<b>Everything here is about murder,
robbery, and assault.</b>

962
01:05:18,768 --> 01:05:21,687
<b>I truly mean it.</b>

963
01:05:22,396 --> 01:05:25,107
<b>I have a family.</b>

964
01:05:26,025 --> 01:05:27,651
<b>I work 13 hours a day.</b>

965

<b>Good luck.</b>

967
01:05:40,373 --> 01:05:42,333
<b>What? You lent him money? How much?</b>

968
01:05:42,416 --> 01:05:44,502
<b>I told you. 2,007,560 won.</b>

969
01:05:44,585 --> 01:05:47,838
<b>He said he needed to check out of
the hotel, but he was missing that much.</b>

970
01:05:48,631 --> 01:05:50,216
<b>Do you sleep on a pile of cash?</b>

971
01:05:50,925 --> 01:05:54,887
<b>That guy didn't even have 7,560 won
to pay himself.</b>

972
01:05:54,970 --> 01:05:56,347
<b>How could you lend him that much?</b>

973
01:05:56,639 --> 01:06:00,184
<b>He walks in even strides, has precise
pronunciation, and is good with words.</b>

974
01:06:00,267 --> 01:06:02,520
<b>You can't achieve that
with just any education, you know.</b>

975
01:06:02,603 --> 01:06:05,856
<b>I'm sure he's wealthy. You just wait.
He'll pay me back double the amount.</b>

976
01:06:06,941 --> 01:06:09,360
<b>My gosh. Where is he right now?</b>

977
01:06:09,443 --> 01:06:12,321
<b>He would've gone back to his world.
He said he was going home.</b>

978
01:06:14,198 --> 01:06:15,199
<b>What?</b>

979
01:06:16,409 --> 01:06:18,953
<b>He said he's the King of his country.</b>

980
01:06:19,036 --> 01:06:20,871
<b>And that he left
the palace empty for too long.</b>

981
01:06:21,455 --> 01:06:23,374
<b>He said he was going to stop by somewhere
and head home.</b>
