00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:56,325
<b>Have you found them?</b>

158
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:58,395
<b>Kidnapping? What kidnapping?</b>

159
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:00,965
<b>Byeol-na told me that she was kidnapped</b>

160
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:03,365
<b>in a black van
and got dragged to the school.</b>

161
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:04,679
<b>You said you found the van!</b>

162
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:08,179
<b>It's the black van deserted on Highway 59.</b>

163
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:09,505
<b>The unregistered van, you know.</b>

164
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,619
<b>- That one?
- Yes.</b>

165
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:14,645
<b>What does that have anything to do
with kidnapping?</b>

166
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:16,689
<b>You're jumping to conclusions here.</b>

167
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:19,659
<b>There has never been such a case
in this district before.</b>

168
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:21,189
<b>If it's not kidnapping,</b>

169
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:24,855
<b>how did Byeol-na end up in a deserted
school on her way to the market?</b>

170
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,565
<b>We're going all "CSI" on this.</b>

171
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,765
<b>Do you think you're in a drama?</b>

172
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,499
<b>And how can we trust what she's saying?</b>

173
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,569
<b>She's out of her mind.</b>

174
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:37,275
<b>- What did you just say?
- Stop here.</b>

175
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,209
<b>[ I don't know
what else we'd be able to find,  ]</b>

176
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:42,145
<b>but we'll look into it and contact you
when we find something.</b>

177
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,575
<b>Take him back.</b>

178
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:45,319
<b>- Yes.
- Seriously...</b>

179
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,789
<b>Let's head out first.</b>

180
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:49,115
<b>- That man...
- Come on.</b>

181
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:16,005
<b>Dad.</b>

182

<b>Hyun-a.</b>

183
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:25,885
<b>This is a very important time for us.</b>

184
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:27,485
<b>What do you think you're doing?</b>

185
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:28,955
<b>Dad,</b>

186
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:34,125
<b>I don't think I can keep doing this.</b>

187
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:36,125
<b>What do you mean?</b>

188
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:38,235
<b>Living as Bella</b>

189
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:41,505
<b>is too painful to live.</b>

190
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:43,165
<b>Get it together!</b>

191
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,705
<b>We've already crossed the river.</b>

192
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:51,215
<b>Have you forgotten all the things
I've done for you?</b>

193
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:55,945
<b>Please, Dad.</b>

194
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:01,885
<b>I'm not Bella.</b>

195
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:04,555
<b>Please.</b>

196
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:10,395
<b>Hyun-a, you wanted to be like Bella.</b>

197
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,965
<b>That's why I did all of this.</b>

198
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:15,265
<b>Dad, I...</b>

199
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:18,405
<b>For the past 30 years,</b>

200
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,975
<b>I've done my best to serve Chairman Han,</b>

201
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:25,715
<b>because I wanted to be one of them.</b>

202
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:28,289
<b>So I endured all sorts of
degrading moments,</b>

203
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:29,945
<b>trying my best.</b>

204
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:33,585
<b>But he's still only using me.</b>

205
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:35,825
<b>You know</b>

206
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:38,355
<b>what I learned from that?</b>

207
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:42,165
<b>You have to take what you want</b>

208

<b>from others.</b>

209
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:46,635
<b>There's nothing wrong with that.</b>

210
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:50,165
<b>That's how the world works.</b>

211
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:52,475
<b>Understood?</b>

212
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:02,219
<b>Change up Hyun-a's security guards

<b>[ - Hello. ]
- Are you okay? What happened?</b>

<b>[ My goodness. ]</b>

223
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:38,985
<b>? Look how beautiful it is ?</b>

224
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:40,929
<b>[ Is this really the right time
to be humming? ]</b>

225
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:42,929
<b>The flowers are just so pretty.</b>

226
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:44,559
<b>Can we leave flowers in the hospital room?</b>

227
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,929
<b>I don't think it's allowed anymore.</b>

228

<b>What are you talking about?</b>

229

230
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:53,539
<b>You're right.
The flowers brighten up the room.</b>

235
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,145
<b>Fine.</b>

236
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:04,115
<b>It's a dangerous world out there.</b>

237
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:07,349
<b>How dare someone just kidnapped you
in broad daylight?</b>

238
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:09,589
<b>[ Exactly. You could've died. ]</b>

239
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:12,755
<b>It's a relief that you're fine.
You were so lucky.</b>

<b>That's right.</b>

241
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:18,525
<b>As long as you came out of
the fire pit alive and in one piece.</b>

<b>It wasn't just any fire.</b>

243

<b>- The entire building was on fire.
[ - Really? ]</b>

244
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,495
<b>It wasn't the whole building.</b>

245
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:29,839
<b>That's what it felt like.</b>

246
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:33,239
<b>I'm just saying. We couldn't go inside,</b>

247
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,479
<b>just not knowing what to do,</b>

248
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:38,719
<b>but Seung-mo jumped right inside.</b>

249

<b>[ Then what happened? ]</b>

250
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:46,059
<b>? And I will ?</b>

<b>? Save Yoo Byeol-na ?</b>

252
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:52,699
<b>He flew out of the fire
with Byeol-na in his arms.</b>

253
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:55,669
<b>- And?
- It was amazing,</b>

254
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:57,599
<b>even in the eyes of men like myself!</b>

255

<b>That's right! Dad was awesome!</b>

256

<b>- Right?
- He's awesome, indeed.</b>

257
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:06,305
<b>I think I'm falling in love with him

258
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:09,605
<b>What are you talking about?</b>

259
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,145
<b>That's not what's important.</b>

260

<b>His back is burnt from the fire.</b>

261

<b>[ - Chef Moon!
- Are you all right? ]</b>

<b>[ My goodness. ]</b>

267

<b>I told you

<b>How can I do that?</b>

269
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:35,739
<b>It's better if the whole village

<b>- That's right. We're family here.
[ - Have one. ]</b>

<b>Mr. Moon, please come

<b>Oh, no. Is it serious?</b>

273
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,935
<b>[ That must hurt a lot. ]</b>

274

<b>Chef Moon has a nice body.</b>

00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:13,405
<b>Gosh, that stings. It must sting a lot.</b>

277

<b>- Oh, no. Goodness!

282
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:29,389
<b>Which course would you like today?</b>

283
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:32,825
<b>My skin feels chapped.
It must be because it's winter now.</b>

<b>Okay. I understand. Please come with me.</b>

285
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,779
<b>I must have forgotten my bag.</b>

286

<b>- Why don't I go get it for you?
- No, I'll get it myself.</b>

<b>[ I should sell Donghan Food's stocks. ]</b>

<b>No, he's not the only child.
