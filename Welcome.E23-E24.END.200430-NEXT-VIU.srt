1
00:00:06,167 --> 00:00:07,337
- Transform. - No!

2
00:00:07,337 --> 00:00:08,836
- Stop, Mister! - Transform.

3
00:00:08,836 --> 00:00:11,277
Transform.

4
00:00:11,277 --> 00:00:12,676
- Turn into a human. - Mister!

5
00:00:12,676 --> 00:00:14,476
Transform. Transform.

6
00:00:15,047 --> 00:00:16,076
Trans...

7
00:00:16,817 --> 00:00:17,817
Hong Jo.

8
00:00:18,447 --> 00:00:19,747
Will you change now?

9
00:00:19,916 --> 00:00:20,986
Transform.

10
00:00:21,616 --> 00:00:22,717
Transform!

11
00:00:23,116 --> 00:00:25,587
Transform. Transform!

12
00:00:27,557 --> 00:00:28,686
Darn it.

13
00:00:35,627 --> 00:00:36,636
Hong Jo.

14
00:00:38,536 --> 00:00:39,536
Sol Ah.

15
00:00:44,536 --> 00:00:45,536
Sol Ah.

16
00:00:46,746 --> 00:00:47,776
Sol Ah!

17
00:00:48,147 --> 00:00:51,216
What... What are you doing? Why did you get in?

18
00:00:51,216 --> 00:00:52,547
Where are you going?

19
00:00:52,547 --> 00:00:54,117
I can't believe this!

20
00:00:54,117 --> 00:00:56,017
Fasten your seatbelt.

21
00:00:56,017 --> 00:00:58,587
Last time, you only paid a fine, but this time, it'll be different.

22
00:00:58,816 --> 00:00:59,827
Sol Ah!

23
00:01:01,026 --> 00:01:03,456
Sol Ah! Sol Ah!

24
00:01:08,666 --> 00:01:10,067
I'm at the entrance of the cafe street.

25
00:01:10,636 --> 00:01:11,666
Please hurry up.

26
00:01:11,666 --> 00:01:14,737
I have nothing to lose. All my cats died because of you.

27
00:01:14,737 --> 00:01:17,106
None of them died. They all found great owners.

28
00:01:17,106 --> 00:01:18,276
Great owners, my foot.

29
00:01:18,276 --> 00:01:20,947
You treated my house like a prison, but you think your place is great?

30
00:01:20,947 --> 00:01:22,307
Fasten your seatbelt!

31
00:01:22,307 --> 00:01:24,076
Why would I? I'm going to get out! Stop the car!

32
00:01:24,076 --> 00:01:25,716
- You're just going to keep them... - Stop the car!

33
00:01:25,716 --> 00:01:28,787
in the house just like I did. How are you different from me?

34
00:01:29,186 --> 00:01:30,516
Fasten your seatbelt!

35
00:01:30,516 --> 00:01:32,016
Stop the car!

36
00:01:32,016 --> 00:01:33,026
- Fasten your seatbelt. - What are you doing?

37
00:01:33,026 --> 00:01:34,727
- Fasten your seatbelt. - Let me go! What are you doing?

38
00:01:34,727 --> 00:01:36,526
No, just stop the car!

39
00:01:36,526 --> 00:01:37,656
- What's going on? - What?

40
00:01:37,656 --> 00:01:38,856
Darn it.

41
00:01:41,227 --> 00:01:42,227
Don't...

42
00:01:42,466 --> 00:01:43,567
- Let me go. - Let me go.

43
00:01:43,567 --> 00:01:45,266
- Let me go. Let go of me. - You let go.

44
00:01:45,266 --> 00:01:47,007
I... I don't want to fight.

45
00:01:47,007 --> 00:01:49,037
Do you think I do? You know what? Let's just fight.

46
00:01:49,037 --> 00:01:50,537
- Let me go. - I'll teach you a lesson.

47
00:01:50,537 --> 00:01:52,037
- I told you to let go. - My hair.

48
00:01:52,037 --> 00:01:53,477
- My hair. - What about your hair?

49
00:01:53,477 --> 00:01:54,677
Should I pull on it harder?

50
00:01:54,677 --> 00:01:56,177
- My hair will fall out. - Get off me.

51
00:01:56,177 --> 00:01:57,447
I don't care...

52
00:01:57,447 --> 00:01:59,177
- if your hair falls out or not. - Stop.

53
00:01:59,177 --> 00:02:01,647
Why did the car stop?

54
00:02:01,886 --> 00:02:02,916
What's wrong?

55
00:02:05,287 --> 00:02:06,826
- What the... - My goodness.

56
00:02:06,826 --> 00:02:08,957
There's a car waiting behind us.

57
00:02:11,726 --> 00:02:13,667
Sorry! Just a second!

58
00:02:13,667 --> 00:02:14,767
- Hurry. - Okay.

59
00:02:14,767 --> 00:02:16,367
Step on the pedal.

60
00:02:16,367 --> 00:02:17,737
- Let me go. - You let go first.

61
00:02:17,737 --> 00:02:19,397
- How about we let go together? - Okay.

62
00:02:19,397 --> 00:02:21,406
- 1, 2... - 2...

63
00:02:21,737 --> 00:02:22,737
Three.

64
00:02:23,036 --> 00:02:24,936
What do you think you're doing? Stop it!

65
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:25,936
Hey!

66
00:02:26,207 --> 00:02:27,776
I told you to let go!

67
00:02:27,776 --> 00:02:29,677
Okay, fine. I let go.

68
00:02:29,677 --> 00:02:31,077
- How can I trust you? - Let me go.

69
00:02:31,077 --> 00:02:33,346
My hands. My hands are up here.

70
00:02:33,346 --> 00:02:35,117
You want me to let go? Okay.

71
00:02:37,987 --> 00:02:39,057
My gosh.

72
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:42,357
Sorry.

73
00:02:43,557 --> 00:02:44,596
Sol Ah.

74
00:02:46,626 --> 00:02:48,897
What happened? Are you okay?

75
00:02:49,026 --> 00:02:50,036
Sol Ah!

76
00:02:54,307 --> 00:02:55,337
Are you okay?

77
00:02:55,337 --> 00:02:56,436
- Yes. - Did you get hurt?

78
00:02:56,436 --> 00:02:57,536
Are you okay?

79
00:03:19,297 --> 00:03:20,297
You...

80
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:24,637
I... I was right.

81
00:03:24,637 --> 00:03:25,637
No, you're wrong.

82
00:03:25,936 --> 00:03:27,307
I'm not locked up.

83
00:03:27,867 --> 00:03:30,707
Waiting for her is the most important thing in my life,

84
00:03:30,707 --> 00:03:31,876
and it makes me happy.

85
00:03:32,376 --> 00:03:34,506
But the cats that were with you...

86
00:03:35,406 --> 00:03:36,976
never waited for you to come home.

87
00:03:38,077 --> 00:03:40,017
So your love is an illness.

88
00:03:47,987 --> 00:03:49,756
I told you it'll be different this time.

89
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:02,237
Sol Ah, are you okay?

90
00:04:02,906 --> 00:04:04,036
Sol Ah.

91
00:04:04,776 --> 00:04:05,876
Who is this guy?

92
00:04:06,207 --> 00:04:08,246
What did you do to her?

93
00:04:09,406 --> 00:04:10,976
Did you get hurt?

94
00:04:11,077 --> 00:04:12,417
I'm okay.

95
00:04:13,617 --> 00:04:16,516
But Hong Jo... He's not well.

96
00:04:17,987 --> 00:04:22,427
("The cat is nature's masterpiece." Quote by Leonardo da Vinci)

97
00:04:29,027 --> 00:04:30,836
I just got the test results.

98
00:04:32,037 --> 00:04:35,336
Does your cat exercise a lot?

99
00:04:35,407 --> 00:04:37,677
I'm sure you don't abuse him.

100
00:04:37,876 --> 00:04:41,047
What? What do you mean?

101
00:04:41,047 --> 00:04:43,646
He shows a high inflammation level and lack of liver function.

102
00:04:43,847 --> 00:04:45,016
But I don't know why.

103
00:04:45,217 --> 00:04:47,417
It could be due to stress.

104
00:04:47,617 --> 00:04:51,057
Is there anything wrong with his heart?

105
00:04:51,316 --> 00:04:53,326
His heart beats really fast.

106
00:04:53,657 --> 00:04:56,057
Their heartbeat is normally faster than ours.

107
00:04:56,227 --> 00:04:58,557
Then what can we do to treat him?

108
00:04:58,657 --> 00:05:00,797
We don't know exactly what it is that's causing him to be like this.

109
00:05:01,367 --> 00:05:03,537
You should first make sure he gets good rest...

110
00:05:03,737 --> 00:05:04,766
and eats well.

111
00:05:04,766 --> 00:05:07,206
If he doesn't eat well, that could harm the liver.

112
00:05:07,206 --> 00:05:09,836
And if it gets worse, it will be very dangerous.

113
00:05:22,117 --> 00:05:23,956
Hey, don't you have any instant noodles?

114
00:05:25,256 --> 00:05:27,987
Sol Ah, here you go.

115
00:05:29,886 --> 00:05:31,826
Weren't you supposed to go to the East Sea to see the sunrise?

116
00:05:31,826 --> 00:05:32,826
Exactly.

117
00:05:33,097 --> 00:05:35,196
If it weren't for you, we'd already be there...

118
00:05:35,196 --> 00:05:37,667
eating a warm bowl of udon noodles.

119
00:05:38,037 --> 00:05:39,566
So let's eat instant noodles instead.

120
00:05:39,566 --> 00:05:41,237
You must've been startled.

121
00:05:41,907 --> 00:05:44,107
We'll stay with you tonight.

122
00:05:44,636 --> 00:05:47,246
You guys can go. I'll stay with her.

123
00:05:47,506 --> 00:05:48,506
You too?

124
00:05:49,347 --> 00:05:51,677
How many bags of noodles do we need to cook?

125
00:05:52,446 --> 00:05:55,386
By the way, where is Bang Guk Bong?

126
00:05:55,917 --> 00:05:57,917
He's not Bang Guk Bong.

127
00:05:57,917 --> 00:05:59,987
Oh, right. Was it Hong Jo?

128
00:06:00,357 --> 00:06:02,256
But I have to say, the name sounds so familiar.

129
00:06:02,826 --> 00:06:05,826
Hong Jo. Hong Jo.

130
00:06:06,456 --> 00:06:09,867
Hong Jo. Hong Jo.

131
00:06:16,636 --> 00:06:19,537
Hey, are you okay?

132
00:06:19,537 --> 00:06:20,547
Let me see.

133
00:06:22,477 --> 00:06:24,876
- I'm okay. - Did you see that? The cat...

134
00:06:24,977 --> 00:06:27,417
Hong Jo, are you okay?

135
00:06:27,917 --> 00:06:31,756
Yes, I remember. That's the name of her cat.

136
00:06:34,256 --> 00:06:36,357
What's with this reaction?

137
00:06:36,557 --> 00:06:37,857
Didn't you guys see what happened?

138
00:06:38,297 --> 00:06:41,496
Am I the only one who saw that? The cat turned into a human being.

139
00:06:43,667 --> 00:06:45,396
You don't believe me, do you?

140
00:06:45,896 --> 00:06:48,336
Oh, I remember!

141
00:06:49,237 --> 00:06:51,907
The day you moved here, Jae Seon and I came over.

142
00:06:52,006 --> 00:06:56,047
There was a guy upstairs, but then a cat suddenly appeared.

143
00:06:56,646 --> 00:06:59,617
Gosh, I knew it!

144
00:06:59,816 --> 00:07:03,386
You were the first one to see it but the last one to realize it?

145
00:07:03,386 --> 00:07:04,516
You all knew?

146
00:07:05,456 --> 00:07:06,557
Then why didn't you tell me?

147
00:07:09,357 --> 00:07:10,357
Bang Guk...

148
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:13,126
I mean, Hong...

149
00:07:15,667 --> 00:07:18,467
Hey, brother. How could you do this to me?

150
00:07:19,336 --> 00:07:22,436
I think you should go somewhere and help him calm down.

151
00:07:22,436 --> 00:07:23,537
Yes, you're right.

152
00:07:24,006 --> 00:07:26,607
Yes, go ahead. Jae Seon, you should go too.

153
00:07:26,907 --> 00:07:28,446
Your dad will be worried.

154
00:07:31,516 --> 00:07:32,746
Will you be okay?

155
00:07:35,117 --> 00:07:36,956
Thank you guys for everything tonight.

156
00:07:37,016 --> 00:07:38,756
This doesn't make sense.

157
00:07:39,287 --> 00:07:41,657
I'd get it if he were a dog, but he's a cat.

158
00:07:42,326 --> 00:07:43,927
He's definitely a dog type.

159
00:07:44,657 --> 00:07:46,427
We'll be off now.

160
00:07:46,427 --> 00:07:47,896
Call me if something comes up.

161
00:07:52,636 --> 00:07:53,766
Wait. Let me see him one more...

162
00:07:53,766 --> 00:07:54,807
No.

163
00:07:55,006 --> 00:07:57,006
Let's go. We're late.

164
00:07:58,477 --> 00:07:59,636
We'll be off now.

165
00:07:59,836 --> 00:08:01,376
- See you. - Bye.

166
00:08:02,706 --> 00:08:03,777
My gosh.

167
00:08:18,027 --> 00:08:19,126
You're not alone.

168
00:08:23,097 --> 00:08:24,867
I was worried you might be all alone if I wasn't around.

169
00:08:25,696 --> 00:08:27,107
But I was worried for nothing.

170
00:08:28,436 --> 00:08:30,206
Why would you say that?

171
00:08:31,037 --> 00:08:32,436
Why wouldn't you be around?

172
00:08:34,677 --> 00:08:36,507
I wasn't able to be there for you this time too.

173
00:08:37,417 --> 00:08:38,716
Especially when...

174
00:08:40,816 --> 00:08:42,186
you needed me the most.

175
00:08:43,086 --> 00:08:44,287
What are you talking about?

176
00:08:46,826 --> 00:08:48,427
You were always there for me.

177
00:08:49,686 --> 00:08:51,057
You don't need to be human.

178
00:08:52,527 --> 00:08:54,466
So don't force yourself to change.

179
00:08:58,137 --> 00:08:59,167
Sol Ah.

180
00:09:00,866 --> 00:09:04,037
If I fail to change again...

181
00:09:04,037 --> 00:09:05,706
It's because you're tired.

182
00:09:06,277 --> 00:09:07,777
The doctor told me you're okay.

183
00:09:07,777 --> 00:09:09,407
He said you'll be okay once you get some rest.

184
00:09:10,846 --> 00:09:11,917
So...

185
00:09:13,346 --> 00:09:15,216
just stay as a cat for a while.

186
00:09:16,446 --> 00:09:17,456
Okay?

187
00:10:36,527 --> 00:10:37,637
It's been a long time...

188
00:10:38,966 --> 00:10:40,167
since we sat like this.

189
00:10:50,917 --> 00:10:52,277
Aren't you going to say anything?

190
00:10:53,686 --> 00:10:55,686
You've become really talkative.

191
00:10:59,586 --> 00:11:00,726
In the past,

192
00:11:00,726 --> 00:11:03,127
you would sit like this and stay silent for an entire hour.

193
00:11:11,167 --> 00:11:12,236
You're right.

194
00:11:14,537 --> 00:11:16,667
I barely got myself to talk.

195
00:11:22,047 --> 00:11:23,307
But it's too late, isn't it?

196
00:11:26,076 --> 00:11:28,446
I couldn't say anything when I should've talked to you.

197
00:11:31,757 --> 00:11:32,856
But I'm finally...

198
00:11:36,157 --> 00:11:38,027
ready to talk.

199
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:45,537
There's so much I want to share.

200
00:11:48,066 --> 00:11:49,436
But no one's here to listen.

201
00:11:54,177 --> 00:11:55,907
You're not late.

202
00:11:58,716 --> 00:12:00,716
You gave your dad his last gift.

203
00:12:09,657 --> 00:12:11,096
I tried so hard to run away...

204
00:12:14,027 --> 00:12:15,966
not knowing that there's always an end to everything.

205
00:12:20,606 --> 00:12:22,037
If I had come back earlier,

206
00:12:24,177 --> 00:12:26,407
it would've been a better ending.

207
00:12:34,517 --> 00:12:35,586
My dad...

208
00:12:37,216 --> 00:12:38,956
has been waiting for me all along.

209
00:12:42,557 --> 00:12:43,586
But...

210
00:12:45,027 --> 00:12:46,657
I made him wait for too long.

211
00:12:52,297 --> 00:12:54,336
We spent such little time together.

212
00:13:00,846 --> 00:13:02,547
You're really talkative now.

213
00:13:07,747 --> 00:13:08,787
Go ahead...

214
00:13:10,387 --> 00:13:11,686
and say what you want to say.

215
00:13:13,157 --> 00:13:15,387
There are plenty of people who are willing to listen to you.

216
00:13:27,667 --> 00:13:28,936
How is Hong Jo?

217
00:13:32,476 --> 00:13:33,537
Tell me.

218
00:13:36,407 --> 00:13:38,417
You used to tell me to be quiet...

219
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:40,316
every time I tried to chat before.

220
00:13:46,856 --> 00:13:48,657
Did he not change that day...

221
00:13:51,157 --> 00:13:52,927
because he couldn't?

222
00:13:57,196 --> 00:13:58,236
Yes.

223
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,236
Do you think it hurts him...

224
00:14:06,177 --> 00:14:08,177
every time he turns human?

225
00:14:10,716 --> 00:14:12,616
Like when a cat that gets abused?

226
00:14:16,116 --> 00:14:17,257
He told me...

227
00:14:18,757 --> 00:14:21,186
that he used up too much of his time.

228
00:14:24,397 --> 00:14:27,466
Maybe that's why he can't change any more.

229
00:14:33,336 --> 00:14:34,436
No way.

230
00:14:35,307 --> 00:14:36,366
That can't be.

231
00:14:37,807 --> 00:14:40,647
This is too short.

232
00:14:42,846 --> 00:14:44,747
I also thought I'd have more time...

233
00:14:47,616 --> 00:14:48,787
with my dad...

234
00:14:51,356 --> 00:14:52,486
and you.

235
00:14:53,826 --> 00:14:54,956
I can't believe this.

236
00:15:00,627 --> 00:15:01,627
Then...

237
00:15:05,596 --> 00:15:07,606
Then are you saying he spent all that time...

238
00:15:09,267 --> 00:15:10,907
waiting for me?

239
00:15:13,336 --> 00:15:14,346
Welcome home.

240
00:15:16,706 --> 00:15:17,777
Welcome home.

241
00:15:19,377 --> 00:15:20,377
Welcome home.

242
00:15:20,716 --> 00:15:24,456
It's too hard for me if you're always waiting for me.

243
00:15:26,787 --> 00:15:28,127
Don't wait for me.

244
00:15:29,057 --> 00:15:30,997
I'm all he has.

245
00:15:34,427 --> 00:15:36,497
All he ever did was wait for me.

246
00:15:40,366 --> 00:15:42,466
But do you know what I said to him?

247
00:15:50,917 --> 00:15:52,816
I told him to stop waiting.

248
00:15:56,517 --> 00:15:58,917
I told him I can't focus on work when I know he's waiting for me.

249
00:16:01,557 --> 00:16:04,856
I said that after I promised to make every second worth it with him.

250
00:16:09,667 --> 00:16:11,596
I can't believe I said that to him.

251
00:16:36,456 --> 00:16:37,557
I'm sorry.

252
00:16:40,196 --> 00:16:42,167
I should be the one consoling you.

253
00:16:47,267 --> 00:16:49,407
Just like how you silently gave me a hug,

254
00:16:54,106 --> 00:16:56,247
I should be doing the same for you.

255
00:17:41,086 --> 00:17:42,156
I'm sorry.

256
00:17:49,267 --> 00:17:50,566
I'm so sorry.

257
00:18:03,007 --> 00:18:05,477
(Nalsaem Design)

258
00:18:06,217 --> 00:18:07,316
Are you serious?

259
00:18:08,517 --> 00:18:10,816
Don't you think you're being too rash?

260
00:18:11,787 --> 00:18:14,656
I was going to put you in charge for the next project.

261
00:18:14,926 --> 00:18:16,987
Something important came up.

262
00:18:18,057 --> 00:18:19,856
Do you want to negotiate your salary?

263
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:22,896
It's not about the money. What I need is time.

264
00:18:22,997 --> 00:18:24,767
You should give us time as well.

265
00:18:24,767 --> 00:18:25,866
This is way too sudden.

266
00:18:27,237 --> 00:18:28,336
I'm sorry.

267
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:35,876
About when the client asked me to put you back on the team.

268
00:18:36,747 --> 00:18:40,116
The truth is, it was because they liked your design.

269
00:18:41,517 --> 00:18:43,386
I wasn't going to tell you this,

270
00:18:43,646 --> 00:18:44,816
but it's a parting gift.

271
00:18:48,356 --> 00:18:50,487
I got you something as well.

272
00:18:51,426 --> 00:18:52,926
It's not chocolate, is it?

273
00:18:53,126 --> 00:18:54,326
I'm trying to lose weight.

274
00:18:55,497 --> 00:18:56,527
It's mine.

275
00:18:58,497 --> 00:19:00,037
Good luck with your webtoon.

276
00:19:00,037 --> 00:19:02,307
If you do a poor job after quitting on me like this,

277
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:03,636
I'll leave a nasty comment online.

278
00:19:04,636 --> 00:19:05,707
Thank you.

279
00:19:10,047 --> 00:19:12,217
I'm sorry to escape on my own.

280
00:19:13,116 --> 00:19:15,146
You joined the company because I did.

281
00:19:15,146 --> 00:19:16,217
I did not.

282
00:19:16,316 --> 00:19:17,987
I joined to see Ji Eun.

283
00:19:18,116 --> 00:19:19,287
It was destiny.

284
00:19:19,757 --> 00:19:20,787
It was.

285
00:19:21,287 --> 00:19:23,126
Hey. Is he really a cat?

286
00:19:23,656 --> 00:19:25,356
Can he jump from really high places...

287
00:19:25,356 --> 00:19:27,257
and see well in the dark?

288
00:19:28,126 --> 00:19:29,396
See you.

289
00:19:31,737 --> 00:19:33,937
Hey. What about the toilet?

290
00:19:34,636 --> 00:19:37,106
Does he use a urinal? Or a litter box?

291
00:19:40,136 --> 00:19:41,207
You quit your job?

292
00:19:41,406 --> 00:19:43,047
- Yes. - Why?

293
00:19:43,047 --> 00:19:45,846
I think I'll become a really successful webtoonist.

294
00:19:45,846 --> 00:19:47,247
Didn't you read the comments?

295
00:19:47,247 --> 00:19:48,247
Was it for me?

296
00:19:48,247 --> 00:19:50,856
No. I'm making my dream come true.

297
00:19:50,957 --> 00:19:53,757
There were so many things I wanted to do when I quit my job.

298
00:19:53,757 --> 00:19:57,626
I'll read all the books I wanted to, research various topics,

299
00:19:57,957 --> 00:20:00,227
exercise at home to get my figure back,

300
00:20:00,626 --> 00:20:02,826
and starting today, I'll eat healthily too.

301
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:04,437
Oh, and I'll quit caffeine too.

302
00:20:05,267 --> 00:20:07,136
We don't drink coffee anymore.

303
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:13,576
What should I start with? There's so much I want to do.

304
00:20:21,646 --> 00:20:22,717
Sol Ah.

305
00:20:25,386 --> 00:20:27,626
- Sol Ah. - Yes? What?

306
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:29,856
The sun's already up.

307
00:20:31,527 --> 00:20:33,257
I'm already up too.

308
00:20:33,426 --> 00:20:36,096
Then why won't you get up? You had a lot you wanted to do.

309
00:20:41,307 --> 00:20:43,207
This is one of them.

310
00:20:43,836 --> 00:20:45,336
Sleeping in.

311
00:20:45,777 --> 00:20:47,176
It's no longer morning...

312
00:20:54,217 --> 00:20:55,217
Sol Ah.

313
00:20:56,287 --> 00:20:57,316
You're sleeping again?

314
00:20:58,757 --> 00:20:59,987
I'm reading.

315
00:21:16,636 --> 00:21:17,807
I'm sleepy.

316
00:21:19,777 --> 00:21:21,007
I'm going to bed.

317
00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:27,146
You did nothing but lie around all day.

318
00:21:27,146 --> 00:21:28,586
What did you do?

319
00:21:29,146 --> 00:21:31,957
Why is my bed so cold?

320
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:34,017
Hey. You're a cat.

321
00:21:34,017 --> 00:21:36,457
You should've warmed my bed for me.

322
00:21:36,856 --> 00:21:37,926
Get in here.

323
00:21:41,826 --> 00:21:42,826
Sol Ah.

324
00:21:43,527 --> 00:21:44,636
Sit up.

325
00:21:51,737 --> 00:21:52,777
Is that coffee?

326
00:21:53,336 --> 00:21:54,747
You can't drink that.

327
00:21:55,846 --> 00:21:58,277
It's for you so you can wake up.

328
00:21:59,047 --> 00:22:00,947
I threw out all the coffee.

329
00:22:02,687 --> 00:22:03,747
Sonamu.

330
00:22:04,047 --> 00:22:05,217
You went on your own?

331
00:22:05,656 --> 00:22:06,856
It's dangerous.

332
00:22:06,856 --> 00:22:08,156
Why won't you go out?

333
00:22:08,156 --> 00:22:09,926
You've been indoors, sleeping for days.

334
00:22:10,856 --> 00:22:11,926
Well...

335
00:22:12,997 --> 00:22:14,866
I need to sleep...

336
00:22:15,727 --> 00:22:17,527
to make you sleep.

337
00:22:30,346 --> 00:22:31,346
Come here.

338
00:23:43,646 --> 00:23:45,787
Your heart's beating so fast.

339
00:23:47,787 --> 00:23:50,126
Is that why your time passes by quicker?

340
00:23:57,467 --> 00:23:59,697
Beat a little slower.

341
00:24:02,237 --> 00:24:04,876
Don't beat too quickly.

342
00:24:45,376 --> 00:24:46,477
You got a call.

343
00:24:46,517 --> 00:24:49,687
What? I don't see my phone.

344
00:24:52,316 --> 00:24:53,757
It's under the comic book.

345
00:24:54,217 --> 00:24:57,257
Never mind. If I move to get that,

346
00:24:57,656 --> 00:24:59,027
it'll stop ringing.

347
00:25:00,757 --> 00:25:01,767
Hang on.

348
00:25:07,237 --> 00:25:09,136
It's the webtoon manager. Don't take it.

349
00:25:09,136 --> 00:25:11,176
Put it right back down over there.

350
00:25:11,537 --> 00:25:12,636
(Lee Jin Woo)

351
00:25:14,906 --> 00:25:16,007
Darn you.

352
00:25:19,247 --> 00:25:20,916
Hello, Mr. Lee.

353
00:25:21,517 --> 00:25:23,547
Yes, how are you?

354
00:25:24,517 --> 00:25:26,156
Yes, of course.

355
00:25:26,156 --> 00:25:28,527
I'm working hard day and night.

356
00:25:31,727 --> 00:25:32,727
What?

357
00:25:40,297 --> 00:25:43,307
I don't think I can do that.

358
00:25:47,136 --> 00:25:48,876
Not an interview.

359
00:25:49,547 --> 00:25:51,517
My webtoon's still ongoing.

360
00:25:52,247 --> 00:25:54,916
Could you do what you can to cancel it?

361
00:25:56,416 --> 00:25:58,187
Yes. I apologize.

362
00:26:03,957 --> 00:26:06,626
Why did you turn down an interview?

363
00:26:08,497 --> 00:26:10,267
Who would want to know about me?

364
00:26:10,366 --> 00:26:12,197
The people who like your drawings.

365
00:26:12,636 --> 00:26:13,937
Call to say you'll do it.

366
00:26:13,937 --> 00:26:14,937
No.

367
00:26:14,937 --> 00:26:17,307
Did you give up on being human because of me?

368
00:26:17,737 --> 00:26:19,376
Is that what I did to you?

369
00:26:19,376 --> 00:26:21,037
You did not.

370
00:26:21,037 --> 00:26:23,447
If not, then call him back right now.

371
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:25,977
Okay.

372
00:26:35,957 --> 00:26:37,926
Hello again.

373
00:26:39,297 --> 00:26:41,126
About that interview.

374
00:26:42,096 --> 00:26:43,896
Can I have another latte?

375
00:26:43,896 --> 00:26:45,237
Sure. Just a moment.

376
00:26:52,376 --> 00:26:53,406
I'll make it.

377
00:27:04,146 --> 00:27:05,856
- Where's Sol Ah? - She finally went out...

378
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:07,116
to see the webtoon manager.

379
00:27:10,027 --> 00:27:11,596
She told me not to make you work.

380
00:27:14,096 --> 00:27:15,467
This is for me.

381
00:27:16,267 --> 00:27:17,896
And to not give you any coffee.

382
00:27:23,737 --> 00:27:25,636
Coffee doesn't work now anyway.

383
00:27:30,047 --> 00:27:31,777
The time I can spend as a human...

384
00:27:32,646 --> 00:27:34,076
is getting shorter and shorter.

385
00:27:37,846 --> 00:27:40,386
Sol Ah has to live as a human.

386
00:27:41,257 --> 00:27:43,057
But she quit her job for me,

387
00:27:43,656 --> 00:27:45,326
and she can't focus on her webtoon.

388
00:27:47,626 --> 00:27:49,596
She sleeps endlessly like a cat around me.

389
00:27:50,626 --> 00:27:52,767
This isn't why I wanted to stay with her.

390
00:27:53,836 --> 00:27:55,307
I just wanted to hold her.

391
00:27:58,037 --> 00:27:59,777
I'm slowly losing my hands to hold her with.

392
00:28:12,656 --> 00:28:15,487
See? I'm always getting hugged.

393
00:28:18,126 --> 00:28:20,057
Tell me if there's something I can do to help.

394
00:28:21,096 --> 00:28:22,197
Anything.

395
00:28:25,737 --> 00:28:26,937
Do you feel sorry for me?

396
00:28:27,836 --> 00:28:30,707
People give money when they feel sorry for people. Donations, was it?

397
00:28:33,136 --> 00:28:34,176
Oh, right.

398
00:28:35,047 --> 00:28:37,676
People also get money when they quit their jobs. A severance pay.

399
00:28:38,217 --> 00:28:39,316
Are you kidding me?

400
00:28:41,277 --> 00:28:43,086
Hey, get off me.

401
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:03,967
I shouldn't have agreed to do the interview.

402
00:29:07,507 --> 00:29:08,646
You got changed again?

403
00:29:11,676 --> 00:29:13,376
I liked what you wore just before this one.

404
00:29:13,717 --> 00:29:15,447
That was a bit too much.

405
00:29:15,886 --> 00:29:17,146
And that one's too dull.

406
00:29:17,916 --> 00:29:20,156
Should I just call and cancel?

407
00:29:22,727 --> 00:29:24,386
I think what you're wearing right now is the best one.

408
00:29:25,896 --> 00:29:28,197
No, my neck feels so empty.

409
00:29:29,527 --> 00:29:31,697
I don't want to do it. Who was I kidding?

410
00:29:34,237 --> 00:29:35,267
Here.

411
00:29:37,866 --> 00:29:38,937
Smile.

412
00:29:39,477 --> 00:29:40,937
Your smile is the best accessory you could wear.

413
00:29:42,807 --> 00:29:43,947
I want to stay at home.

414
00:29:44,816 --> 00:29:47,047
The last episode of my favorite drama airs today.

415
00:29:47,176 --> 00:29:48,487
- I love that show. - Right?

416
00:29:48,616 --> 00:29:50,717
Let's just buy tteokbokki and fish-shaped buns...

417
00:29:50,717 --> 00:29:52,156
- and stay at home. - The show got canceled today.

418
00:29:52,656 --> 00:29:53,717
Don't lie to me.

419
00:30:00,527 --> 00:30:02,126
You look nice. What do you think?

420
00:30:03,497 --> 00:30:06,967
Why do you want me to become so famous?

421
00:30:07,737 --> 00:30:09,566
I know you want to show off...

422
00:30:09,566 --> 00:30:12,406
your beautiful girlfriend to the entire world.

423
00:30:12,876 --> 00:30:15,947
But do I really need to doll myself up...

424
00:30:16,176 --> 00:30:18,517
to satisfy your desire to show me off?

425
00:30:19,277 --> 00:30:20,947
Are you worried about leaving me here all alone?

426
00:30:21,687 --> 00:30:23,616
- Do you want to come with me? - Can I stay next to you?

427
00:30:23,616 --> 00:30:24,816
No, you can't.

428
00:30:25,687 --> 00:30:28,287
You need to be glued to me like this.

429
00:30:38,967 --> 00:30:40,596
Let's hurry up and get ready.

430
00:30:46,707 --> 00:30:47,937
Do you feel okay?

431
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:49,846
I should be the one asking you that.

432
00:30:50,606 --> 00:30:52,616
Don't worry about me. I'm a pro.

433
00:30:55,386 --> 00:30:57,886
- Did you get the questionnaire? - Yes.

434
00:31:00,457 --> 00:31:01,557
Where did it go?

435
00:31:04,586 --> 00:31:05,656
Here.

436
00:31:06,356 --> 00:31:07,396
Thanks.

437
00:31:08,057 --> 00:31:09,926
Let's take the photos first.

438
00:31:09,926 --> 00:31:11,967
- Come this way once you're ready. - Okay.

439
00:31:18,977 --> 00:31:20,576
My neck feels so empty.

440
00:31:23,376 --> 00:31:24,606
- I'll see you. - Okay.

441
00:31:30,747 --> 00:31:31,816
Be careful.

442
00:31:34,416 --> 00:31:35,987
We'll start with the photoshoot.

443
00:31:36,386 --> 00:31:38,797
You just need to look at me and smile naturally.

444
00:31:39,057 --> 00:31:42,027
The photographer will take care of everything else.

445
00:31:42,566 --> 00:31:43,866
Don't look into the camera.

446
00:31:47,197 --> 00:31:48,336
Gosh, this is awkward.

447
00:31:49,636 --> 00:31:51,136
Well, then...

448
00:31:54,406 --> 00:31:55,676
Don't look somewhere else.

449
00:31:57,247 --> 00:31:59,547
- Please don't look to the side. - Okay.

450
00:31:59,547 --> 00:32:01,076
Don't let your eyes wander.

451
00:32:04,386 --> 00:32:05,416
Hi.

452
00:32:09,057 --> 00:32:10,287
What does this mean?

453
00:32:10,626 --> 00:32:11,826
It says "Mignon".

454
00:32:12,126 --> 00:32:14,997
It's a French word that means "cute","charming",

455
00:32:14,997 --> 00:32:16,166
and "adorable".

456
00:32:18,467 --> 00:32:19,566
I'll take this one.

457
00:32:22,207 --> 00:32:23,666
- That's it. - Okay.

458
00:32:23,666 --> 00:32:25,277
Don't mind the camera. Just be natural.

459
00:32:25,277 --> 00:32:27,376
- Just look at me. - I'm sorry.

460
00:32:28,136 --> 00:32:30,906
Just a second. Give her something to wipe off her sweat.

461
00:32:31,717 --> 00:32:32,777
Sorry.

462
00:32:33,376 --> 00:32:34,447
Thanks.

463
00:32:37,987 --> 00:32:41,856
Have you guys seen a cat by any chance?

464
00:32:41,987 --> 00:32:43,057
A cat?

465
00:32:45,856 --> 00:32:47,027
Never mind.

466
00:32:55,937 --> 00:32:56,967
Thank you.

467
00:33:04,707 --> 00:33:05,876
Ease up.

468
00:33:06,346 --> 00:33:07,346
Okay.

469
00:33:08,916 --> 00:33:10,787
Okay, just a few more.

470
00:33:18,156 --> 00:33:20,557
Let's take a few from here.

471
00:33:22,426 --> 00:33:24,297
I'm sorry. I don't think I can do this.

472
00:33:25,066 --> 00:33:27,767
If you feel too uncomfortable, let's just do the interview first.

473
00:33:28,237 --> 00:33:30,336
I need to find my cat.

474
00:33:30,767 --> 00:33:33,277
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

475
00:33:45,457 --> 00:33:46,987
Sol Ah, what are you doing outside?

476
00:33:47,287 --> 00:33:48,426
Where were you?

477
00:33:51,727 --> 00:33:52,727
Here.

478
00:33:52,957 --> 00:33:55,626
I told you to stay by my side.

479
00:33:56,467 --> 00:33:57,926
I just wanted to help you.

480
00:33:58,967 --> 00:34:00,366
It's over now.

481
00:34:17,386 --> 00:34:18,957
I told you to sleep.

482
00:34:20,256 --> 00:34:21,826
Why are you still human?

483
00:34:26,727 --> 00:34:28,526
Don't stay behind me like that.

484
00:34:49,287 --> 00:34:50,716
Who told you to come in front of me?

485
00:35:05,267 --> 00:35:07,337
You spent too much time as a human being today.

486
00:35:10,707 --> 00:35:12,377
Do you want me to be a cat?

487
00:35:13,537 --> 00:35:14,607
No.

488
00:35:15,647 --> 00:35:17,076
I just don't want you to be sick.

489
00:35:19,446 --> 00:35:21,716
You're right. I should sleep.

490
00:35:24,546 --> 00:35:26,587
This time, I might be asleep for a really long time.

491
00:35:34,227 --> 00:35:35,397
So please take this.

492
00:35:40,236 --> 00:35:42,006
You didn't have to get me this.

493
00:35:42,267 --> 00:35:43,866
You gave me a collar too.

494
00:35:44,437 --> 00:35:46,006
So I also want to put this on for you.

495
00:35:46,736 --> 00:35:48,576
I want this to show that I chose you...

496
00:35:49,506 --> 00:35:50,747
as my owner.

497
00:36:07,457 --> 00:36:10,466
You won't ever lose your way home as long as you wear this necklace.

498
00:36:10,997 --> 00:36:12,636
So you're safe to go outside whenever you want.

499
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:15,537
No matter how far we may be apart,

500
00:36:15,537 --> 00:36:16,937
you'll always be my owner.

501
00:36:19,707 --> 00:36:21,076
This is the mark that proves it.

502
00:36:24,147 --> 00:36:25,346
I want you...

503
00:36:26,616 --> 00:36:28,647
to show everyone what you're capable of.

504
00:36:29,486 --> 00:36:30,616
You totally deserve that.

505
00:36:33,116 --> 00:36:34,116
It's what you need to do.

506
00:36:41,096 --> 00:36:43,026
That way, I'll be able to show you off.

507
00:36:44,796 --> 00:36:45,897
My gosh.

508
00:36:48,466 --> 00:36:49,537
But...

509
00:36:50,707 --> 00:36:52,207
what does it say?

510
00:36:54,176 --> 00:36:55,247
"Mignon".

511
00:36:56,006 --> 00:36:57,276
Is it a sound that a cat makes?

512
00:36:58,477 --> 00:37:01,247
Like "Meow"? "Mignon".

513
00:37:04,846 --> 00:37:08,287
It means "cute","charming", and "adorable".

514
00:37:13,926 --> 00:37:16,267
Look in the mirror. You'll see it's true.

515
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:22,937
It's pretty.

516
00:37:29,346 --> 00:37:30,377
Thank you.

517
00:37:44,227 --> 00:37:45,696
(The last episode will air shortly.)

518
00:37:50,524 --> 00:37:51,823
(Final Episode)

519
00:37:53,194 --> 00:37:55,333
Hong Jo. Let's talk.

520
00:37:56,603 --> 00:37:58,603
I can't concentrate.

521
00:37:58,603 --> 00:38:00,734
Shall we go out and get some fish-shaped buns?

522
00:38:02,903 --> 00:38:05,844
Let's go out and walk hand-in-hand.

523
00:38:06,173 --> 00:38:08,844
I touched your toe beans, so this time I want your hand.

524
00:38:13,814 --> 00:38:17,023
Human Hong Jo, show up.

525
00:38:35,434 --> 00:38:36,744
Tada!

526
00:38:36,803 --> 00:38:38,004
Why are you all here?

527
00:38:38,004 --> 00:38:39,104
We bought this.

528
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:40,314
Come on in.

529
00:38:45,013 --> 00:38:47,054
Hey. You look...

530
00:38:48,983 --> 00:38:50,123
You're glowing.

531
00:38:50,384 --> 00:38:53,393
You've been staying indoors eating, sleeping well, and it shows.

532
00:38:54,824 --> 00:38:57,324
You never leave home even when I call,

533
00:38:57,724 --> 00:39:00,434
and only let us see you if we come over.

534
00:39:01,733 --> 00:39:02,863
Fish-shaped buns.

535
00:39:03,703 --> 00:39:05,033
I was craving some.

536
00:39:05,604 --> 00:39:06,733
Where's Hong Jo?

537
00:39:07,104 --> 00:39:09,434
He's in the room.

538
00:39:12,703 --> 00:39:16,143
Hey, bro. How are you? Why don't you come out?

539
00:39:17,983 --> 00:39:20,013
He stays mostly as a cat these days.

540
00:39:21,013 --> 00:39:23,024
Why? Then he can't talk.

541
00:39:23,324 --> 00:39:24,384
Isn't that frustrating?

542
00:39:35,634 --> 00:39:36,934
It's nice that you're here.

543
00:39:37,533 --> 00:39:38,563
Thank you.

544
00:39:38,863 --> 00:39:41,604
It feels like we haven't met in ages.

545
00:39:45,903 --> 00:39:47,143
How strange.

546
00:39:49,613 --> 00:39:50,613
Oh.

547
00:39:51,914 --> 00:39:53,583
Thank you.

548
00:39:54,414 --> 00:39:55,453
What?

549
00:39:59,384 --> 00:40:01,393
Hong Jo gave me the courage...

550
00:40:01,393 --> 00:40:03,664
to tell you that I like you.

551
00:40:04,463 --> 00:40:06,534
He was in a box.

552
00:40:09,094 --> 00:40:10,933
I thought he was a stray cat,

553
00:40:11,203 --> 00:40:13,203
but he had a ring on his collar.

554
00:40:14,703 --> 00:40:15,933
I like you.

555
00:40:18,444 --> 00:40:21,173
It was you, wasn't it?

556
00:40:21,974 --> 00:40:23,243
How strange.

557
00:40:30,754 --> 00:40:32,453
Your webtoon's almost done, right?

558
00:40:32,724 --> 00:40:34,624
How is it coming along?

559
00:40:35,453 --> 00:40:36,463
Not well.

560
00:40:37,224 --> 00:40:38,624
I'm a bit stuck.

561
00:40:38,824 --> 00:40:41,733
How are you stuck? We can brainstorm with you.

562
00:40:42,034 --> 00:40:43,064
Well...

563
00:40:44,263 --> 00:40:47,134
I don't know how to end it.

564
00:40:48,604 --> 00:40:51,374
I can't picture the end of a cat's life.

565
00:40:53,743 --> 00:40:56,743
Maybe you'll get the answer by going back to the beginning.

566
00:40:58,713 --> 00:41:00,254
What did it mean to you...

567
00:41:01,083 --> 00:41:02,613
when you met the cat?

568
00:41:19,004 --> 00:41:20,074
Sol Ah.

569
00:41:21,803 --> 00:41:22,974
Sol Ah.

570
00:41:26,444 --> 00:41:27,544
Sol Ah.

571
00:41:34,914 --> 00:41:36,083
Hong Jo.

572
00:41:50,303 --> 00:41:52,004
It's really you.

573
00:41:52,803 --> 00:41:54,233
Let's go somewhere.

574
00:41:57,803 --> 00:41:58,803
Where?

575
00:41:59,003 --> 00:42:00,214
Hurry.

576
00:42:00,873 --> 00:42:02,373
There's not much time.

577
00:42:26,204 --> 00:42:27,834
You kept me warm.

578
00:42:30,503 --> 00:42:32,104
Don't look at me like that.

579
00:42:33,474 --> 00:42:35,774
This is what you do when you say your final goodbye.

580
00:42:41,483 --> 00:42:43,354
This is where I first thought...

581
00:42:44,724 --> 00:42:46,454
I should stay with you.

582
00:42:48,753 --> 00:42:50,394
Why do you keep looking back?

583
00:42:54,264 --> 00:42:56,363
I'd rather think about what to do tomorrow.

584
00:42:56,633 --> 00:42:58,664
Shall we go to the seaside?

585
00:42:59,503 --> 00:43:02,133
The day after, let's draw on the rooftop.

586
00:43:02,334 --> 00:43:03,974
And the day after...

587
00:43:05,303 --> 00:43:07,073
This will be the last time...

588
00:43:08,014 --> 00:43:09,514
to see me as human.

589
00:43:12,914 --> 00:43:14,683
How do you know that?

590
00:43:17,284 --> 00:43:18,784
I feel it.

591
00:43:21,753 --> 00:43:23,623
I'm barely managing right now.

592
00:43:28,993 --> 00:43:30,034
No.

593
00:43:31,803 --> 00:43:34,003
If we have some coffee...

594
00:43:34,534 --> 00:43:36,233
Let's have coffee.

595
00:44:02,363 --> 00:44:05,204
I can be human only for a certain amount of time.

596
00:44:07,233 --> 00:44:08,633
I used all that up.

597
00:44:13,443 --> 00:44:15,443
You said you can be human around me.

598
00:44:16,274 --> 00:44:18,243
I'm right beside you.

599
00:44:19,514 --> 00:44:21,383
Why won't it work when I'm so close to you?

600
00:44:25,123 --> 00:44:26,224
Won't this work?

601
00:44:29,024 --> 00:44:30,493
I'll stay with you.

602
00:44:32,363 --> 00:44:35,863
I'll stick right beside you.

603
00:45:02,993 --> 00:45:04,164
Won't this...

604
00:45:07,034 --> 00:45:08,363
help at all?

605
00:45:19,173 --> 00:45:20,373
Thank you.

606
00:45:23,613 --> 00:45:25,584
For being the person to make me human.

607
00:45:30,323 --> 00:45:32,084
Is it really the end?

608
00:45:32,923 --> 00:45:34,053
Already?

609
00:45:36,654 --> 00:45:38,024
You said you'd leave first,

610
00:45:38,024 --> 00:45:40,493
but you never said it would be so soon.

611
00:45:42,493 --> 00:45:43,834
I didn't know either.

612
00:45:46,604 --> 00:45:48,274
If I'd known it would end like this,

613
00:45:50,743 --> 00:45:52,974
I wouldn't have disappeared when we first met.

614
00:45:57,813 --> 00:46:01,613
I shouldn't have let you follow me from behind.

615
00:46:04,123 --> 00:46:06,823
I should've held your hand and kept you close.

616
00:46:09,423 --> 00:46:10,693
I should've...

617
00:46:12,923 --> 00:46:14,664
let you walk next to me.

618
00:46:16,034 --> 00:46:18,103
Hong Jo. Are you all right?

619
00:46:21,703 --> 00:46:23,203
I think it's time.

620
00:46:24,173 --> 00:46:25,203
Don't go.

621
00:46:26,103 --> 00:46:28,044
You said you'd stay with me.

622
00:46:28,914 --> 00:46:31,313
If you leave like this...

623
00:46:32,514 --> 00:46:33,884
I won't leave.

624
00:46:35,453 --> 00:46:36,713
What do you mean?

625
00:46:37,223 --> 00:46:38,784
I just won't be human.

626
00:46:39,453 --> 00:46:41,024
But I'll be with you.

627
00:46:42,624 --> 00:46:43,693
As a cat.

628
00:46:44,124 --> 00:46:46,494
You're disappearing yet you're saying you're not leaving?

629
00:46:47,333 --> 00:46:49,764
You'll be there, but I won't be able to see you.

630
00:46:53,063 --> 00:46:55,673
I won't be able to touch you like this.

631
00:46:57,904 --> 00:46:59,774
I won't be able to hear your voice.

632
00:47:02,374 --> 00:47:04,544
What kind of goodbye is this?

633
00:47:06,484 --> 00:47:07,514
I'm sorry.

634
00:47:09,553 --> 00:47:11,423
I can't hug you anymore.

635
00:47:16,124 --> 00:47:17,823
If you don't turn into a human,

636
00:47:22,193 --> 00:47:24,063
will you not be in pain anymore?

637
00:47:27,933 --> 00:47:29,004
I'm sorry...

638
00:47:31,274 --> 00:47:32,504
for not being human.

639
00:47:37,343 --> 00:47:38,683
You don't have to be a human.

640
00:47:41,914 --> 00:47:43,154
Just don't get sick.

641
00:47:45,254 --> 00:47:46,284
Just...

642
00:47:47,823 --> 00:47:49,994
Just stay beside me.

643
00:47:57,463 --> 00:47:58,703
I'll wait for you.

644
00:48:02,774 --> 00:48:03,904
Since waiting is...

645
00:48:05,244 --> 00:48:06,504
what a cat does.

646
00:48:08,573 --> 00:48:09,713
I'll wait too.

647
00:48:12,544 --> 00:48:15,614
Since tomorrow might come to us again.

648
00:48:21,624 --> 00:48:23,664
So tomorrow, let's go see the ocean.

649
00:48:31,463 --> 00:48:32,504
Let's do that.

650
00:48:34,634 --> 00:48:36,904
And the next day,

651
00:48:40,073 --> 00:48:42,473
let's draw together at home.

652
00:48:49,884 --> 00:48:50,923
Let's do that.

653
00:49:22,713 --> 00:49:24,723
(2 years later, Sonamu)

654
00:49:34,063 --> 00:49:36,193
Water, water, water!

655
00:49:39,563 --> 00:49:40,573
Here.

656
00:49:44,603 --> 00:49:47,274
My phone, phone, phone!

657
00:49:50,713 --> 00:49:52,514
Why are you looking at me so anxiously?

658
00:49:53,014 --> 00:49:54,553
See? I have everything.

659
00:49:56,853 --> 00:49:58,223
I'll be off then.

660
00:50:01,823 --> 00:50:04,264
My bag, bag, bag!

661
00:50:06,364 --> 00:50:07,994
I'm really going now. Bye!

662
00:50:12,433 --> 00:50:15,073
I'm really, really going. Bye!

663
00:50:22,874 --> 00:50:25,744
- Today's the big day. - Yes, it is.

664
00:50:26,083 --> 00:50:27,213
You must be nervous.

665
00:50:29,053 --> 00:50:30,083
See you.

666
00:50:35,524 --> 00:50:38,664
Next, the main color is...

667
00:50:39,024 --> 00:50:42,193
The main color should be a comfortable and warm color...

668
00:50:42,193 --> 00:50:43,563
in a beige tone.

669
00:50:44,364 --> 00:50:46,504
The logo... The logo should be...

670
00:50:57,644 --> 00:51:00,654
And we should include picture icons so children can easily...

671
00:51:10,994 --> 00:51:12,923
Did you also stay up all night because you were so nervous?

672
00:51:14,093 --> 00:51:15,193
I slept really well.

673
00:51:15,994 --> 00:51:18,364
- But why are you yawning? - To help you calm down.

674
00:51:19,264 --> 00:51:20,973
I heard nervous cats feel soothed...

675
00:51:20,973 --> 00:51:22,634
when they see their owner yawn.

676
00:51:24,443 --> 00:51:25,673
Aren't you talking about dogs?

677
00:51:25,843 --> 00:51:27,774
Whether it's a dog or a cat, I'm just saying.

678
00:51:28,244 --> 00:51:29,473
Tell me honestly.

679
00:51:29,473 --> 00:51:31,014
You become an animal when you sleep too, right?

680
00:51:31,713 --> 00:51:32,784
Me?

681
00:51:33,114 --> 00:51:35,284
You're so adorable when you sleep.

682
00:51:35,784 --> 00:51:37,083
How could a human be so adorable?

683
00:51:43,423 --> 00:51:46,423
We selected white as the main color, for a neat look.

684
00:51:47,193 --> 00:51:51,504
And to emphasize certain points, we used a beige color...

685
00:51:51,504 --> 00:51:53,703
that can conjure up a comfortable and warm image.

686
00:51:53,904 --> 00:51:56,904
For the logo, according to our concept of maternal love,

687
00:51:56,904 --> 00:51:59,173
we made an image where it seems like...

688
00:51:59,173 --> 00:52:02,843
a large silhouette is hugging another small silhouette.

689
00:52:05,343 --> 00:52:06,384
Also...

690
00:52:13,124 --> 00:52:15,453
We added picture icons for each menu...

691
00:52:15,453 --> 00:52:17,323
so young children who can't read...

692
00:52:17,323 --> 00:52:19,624
can easily and conveniently place orders.

693
00:52:19,624 --> 00:52:22,463
The concept is based on a cute drawing board...

694
00:52:22,463 --> 00:52:23,833
- that children will love. - What a surprise.

695
00:52:23,833 --> 00:52:25,134
Was she always this good?

696
00:52:25,833 --> 00:52:26,904
Thank you.

697
00:52:32,404 --> 00:52:33,473
Impressive.

698
00:52:33,473 --> 00:52:35,173
("Welcome")

699

(Kim Sol Ah's Autograph Event for "Welcome")

700
00:52:38,784 --> 00:52:40,713
Hello, I'm Kim Sol Ah.

701
00:52:40,914 --> 00:52:42,683
(Kim Sol Ah's Autograph Event for "Welcome")

702
00:52:45,453 --> 00:52:46,453
Let's begin.

703
00:52:46,784 --> 00:52:48,894
- Hello. - Hello.

704
00:52:49,853 --> 00:52:51,723
- Thank you, enjoy the book. - Thank you.

705
00:52:52,723 --> 00:52:53,894
Hello.

706
00:52:54,963 --> 00:52:57,164
- Here you go. Thank you. - Thank you.

707
00:52:57,933 --> 00:52:58,933
("Welcome")

708
00:52:59,103 --> 00:53:00,573
Hello, thank you for coming.

709
00:53:01,333 --> 00:53:03,673
- Here you go, thank you. - Thank you.

710
00:53:05,504 --> 00:53:07,414
- Ta-da! - How did you guys come?

711
00:53:07,414 --> 00:53:08,443
- Ta-da! - Ta-da!

712
00:53:08,443 --> 00:53:10,984
- Hello. - Da Som, hi!

713
00:53:10,984 --> 00:53:12,813
We thought no one would be here, but it's crowded.

714
00:53:13,484 --> 00:53:14,713
Thank you for coming.

715
00:53:14,784 --> 00:53:17,154
My kids love your book, so I came for an autograph.

716
00:53:17,583 --> 00:53:18,683
Ms. Park.

717
00:53:18,823 --> 00:53:20,453
I guess it's perfect for children's tastes.

718
00:53:21,494 --> 00:53:23,223
You haven't changed a bit.

719
00:53:24,223 --> 00:53:25,463
Why don't we take a picture?

720
00:53:25,463 --> 00:53:27,494
1, 2, 3.

721
00:53:30,933 --> 00:53:32,864
Thank you. Have a good day.

722
00:53:38,073 --> 00:53:40,004
It took two years to publish this into a book.

723
00:53:40,744 --> 00:53:42,213
The autograph event is over.

724
00:53:42,973 --> 00:53:44,884
I came right now on purpose.

725
00:53:45,683 --> 00:53:46,744
Let's go get dinner.

726
00:53:47,083 --> 00:53:49,484
You know I can't. Hong Jo is waiting for me.

727
00:53:50,484 --> 00:53:53,284
- Then give me an autograph. - I told you it's over.

728
00:53:53,453 --> 00:53:56,053
Come on, how could you treat a fan like this?

729
00:53:59,994 --> 00:54:01,333
Take this at least then.

730
00:54:04,034 --> 00:54:05,803
Hong Jo's not the only one waiting for you.

731
00:54:06,764 --> 00:54:07,874
You know that.

732
00:54:11,443 --> 00:54:12,774
You have two options.

733
00:54:13,443 --> 00:54:14,774
Do you want to take these flowers or eat dinner?

734
00:54:22,713 --> 00:54:25,624
When I look at Hong Jo lately, he seems so comfortable.

735
00:54:26,853 --> 00:54:28,553
I guess he's really happy being a cat.

736
00:54:31,093 --> 00:54:32,693
Then what about you?

737
00:54:40,004 --> 00:54:41,034
I'm the same.

738
00:54:41,973 --> 00:54:43,573
Him being a cat makes me happy.

739
00:54:47,274 --> 00:54:48,474
Hong Jo...

740
00:54:49,714 --> 00:54:51,343
hugs me even when he doesn't have hands.

741
00:55:25,083 --> 00:55:26,744
Hong Jo, what do you think?

742
00:55:31,053 --> 00:55:32,053
Do you like it?

743
00:55:49,434 --> 00:55:51,274
Just like how you waited for me,

744
00:55:53,103 --> 00:55:54,313
I'm waiting too.

745
00:56:16,393 --> 00:56:19,063
Hong Jo, I'm off to work.

746
00:56:38,954 --> 00:56:39,954
One,

747
00:56:41,393 --> 00:56:42,393
two,

748
00:56:43,694 --> 00:56:44,694
three.

749
00:57:04,714 --> 00:57:05,744
I checked...

750
00:57:07,813 --> 00:57:09,184
every day...

751
00:57:10,823 --> 00:57:12,484
just in case you might've turned into a human.

752
00:57:37,413 --> 00:57:38,813
Even if it's just once,

753
00:57:40,343 --> 00:57:42,083
I want to see you again.

754
00:58:24,053 --> 00:58:25,563
Are you still waiting?

755
00:58:50,984 --> 00:58:53,224
However long it may take,

756
00:58:55,454 --> 00:58:58,294
it's okay even if you come back as a wrinkly old man.

757
00:58:59,863 --> 00:59:00,964
I...

758
00:59:01,994 --> 00:59:03,163
will still...

759
00:59:04,464 --> 00:59:06,204
recognize you right away.

760
01:00:32,754 --> 01:00:33,924
Welcome.

761
01:00:54,413 --> 01:00:57,044
(Thank you for watching "Meow, the Secret Boy".)

762
01:00:58,544 --> 01:01:01,754
He became my priority.

763
01:01:01,754 --> 01:01:03,353
The whole house changed.

764
01:01:03,353 --> 01:01:07,024
The pleasure of seeing a puppy is beyond words.

765
01:01:07,053 --> 01:01:08,823
A friend. A friend I live with.

766
01:01:08,823 --> 01:01:11,424
I don't know if he understands, but when I speak,

767
01:01:11,424 --> 01:01:12,924
he seems to relax.

768
01:01:13,563 --> 01:01:16,163
It's as if they are my caretakers.

769
01:01:16,163 --> 01:01:18,934
It's like they sense their owner's pain.

770
01:01:19,264 --> 01:01:21,474
He gives me a lot of comfort.

771
01:01:22,103 --> 01:01:25,244
I'd like to think that I became a better person.

772
01:01:25,343 --> 01:01:28,444
I learned how to appreciate and love something.

773
01:01:28,444 --> 01:01:31,343
I think I gained the ability...

774
01:01:31,343 --> 01:01:33,984
to be more considerate toward others.

775
01:01:33,984 --> 01:01:35,684
Maybe this much more.

776
01:01:37,454 --> 01:01:39,653
