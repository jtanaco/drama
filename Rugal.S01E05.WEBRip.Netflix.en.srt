00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:50,700
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, RELIGION AND INCIDENTS

2
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:52,950
PORTRAYED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,000
Ta-da!

4
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:00,790
Jeez, this prick. I finally caught him.

5
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:03,670
Congratulations.

6
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,340
-He's that punk?
-Yes.

7
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:08,210
Inspector Song wasted a whole year,
yet you caught him in a month.

8
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:09,420
She's not me.

9
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:11,340
-You never let us down.
-Hey, you can sit there.

10
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,140
-Officer Kim, take him.
-Yes, sir.

11
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:20,190
You'll stay here with me all night.

12
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:22,770
Tell me your underlings, higher-ups,

13
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:25,440
everyone connected to the crime
and exactly what was traded.

14
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:28,150
-Gi-beom, can I help you with anything?
-No, I'm good.

15
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:29,940
Oh, actually...

16
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:36,790
Mi-na.

17
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:38,620
What is it, Gi-beom?

18
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:44,380
And what's up with his face?

19
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:47,630
Be nice, okay? I'll tell you everything.

20
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:52,680
What?

21
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:54,890
What's he saying?

22
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,770
Officer Kim.

23
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:06,900
Assistant Inspector Mun.

24
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:11,190
Detective Yang.

25
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:37,970
What was that about?

26
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:43,940
Dr. Oh.

27
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:47,060
Have you ever been flustered because
you couldn't recognize someone's face?

28
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:51,230
I guess I get like that once in a while,
when I'm very tired.

29
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:53,240
So is this common?

30
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:57,660
Are you saying you might have
face blindness despite your special eyes?

31
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:00,660
The thing is, I do recognize them.
Too well, if anything.

32
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,830
The problem is that I can't see them.

33
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:05,460
Who?

34
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:07,880
I had a dream
where I was with my former colleagues.

35
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:11,840
But all sorts of information popped up
suddenly and covered their faces,

36
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:15,010
so I sat there for at least ten minutes,
drawing a blank.

37
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:16,800
That sounds like a nightmare.

38
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:19,010
If it were real, it'd be even worse
than a nightmare.

39
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:22,270
Can the artificial eyes affect my memory?

40
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:24,270
Sometimes, your brain tries to

41
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:26,640
relieve those unpleasant memories
through nightmares.

42
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:30,150
If it's a temporary thing,
you don't need to be concerned.

43
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:33,530
The problem is, those memories
are a lot worse than "unpleasant."

44
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,300
You scared the crap out of me.

45
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:57,180
-What brings you here?
-The meeting will begin shortly.

46
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:58,550
Also,

47
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:00,470
other people can come here too.

48
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:02,720
Well. That's true, but...

49
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:04,970
I mean...

50
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,440
Well, let's go.

51
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:09,350
What was that weird prank about?

52
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:11,900
My gosh.

53
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:21,280
-You should go to the meeting.
-I will, you fool.

54
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:23,330
I'll leave in a minute.

55
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,040
I do see fragmented images,

56
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,080
but I can't put them together.

57
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:32,130
That's enough.

58
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,260
And we'll take care of the rest,
so don't worry.

59
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:40,340
At Rugal, everyone's got a lot of stories.
And I finally have one to share as well.

60
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:43,890
Just focus on your recovery, okay?

61
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:49,560
I'll recover as fast as lizards do
when I'm all charged up.

62
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:53,520
You make me laugh.

63
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:54,980
What?

64
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:57,530
-Do you have a crush on me?
-You idiot.

65
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,780
What I'm saying is, I don't want to worry
about losing a teammate ever again.

66
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:04,950
I get it. I know how you feel.

67
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,040
I'll recover quickly
so that I can make you laugh more.

68
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:11,580
Good.

69
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:21,630
Seong-min, what are you doing?

70
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:23,090
Let's go home.

71
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,730
What is that?

72
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,980
As for Assemblyman Park's case,

73
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:38,780
we can think of it as Argos
putting on a show after losing its leader.

74
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,950
But the recent cases are different.

75
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,580
Their power structure is being reshuffled,

76
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:49,450
And the crimes show
exhibitionistic tendencies.

77
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,250
It's very concerning.

78
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:55,080
It's probably because of Hwang Deuk-gu,
the psycho who shows up every single time.

79
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,420
Choi Ye-won could be the mastermind.

80
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,630
And we shouldn't underestimate Choi Yong.

81
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:03,930
Bong Man-cheol lost the power struggle,
but he won't stay quiet either.

82
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:06,350
What about Seol Min-jun,
who got whacked on his own turf?

83
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:09,680
Gi-beom will look into it.

84
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,940
-By himself?
-I'll supervise him.

85
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:16,860
He's got the state-of-the-art technology.
Let's put it to good use.

86
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:21,650
As for us, let's go after the evidence
Gwang-cheol remembered.

87
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:34,870
-Gwang-cheol...
-Gwang-cheol...

88
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:36,290
Go ahead.

89
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:39,840
He can't sleep.

90
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:45,050
Yes, I bet. He's a tenderhearted guy.

91
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,470
-Are you all right?
-Sorry?

92
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:52,180
Can you sleep?

93
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,440
You eavesdropped on our conversation?

94
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:57,810
I just happened to overhear it.

95
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:58,860
Hold on.

96
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:00,900
You're worried about me?

97
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:03,400
We're short-staffed,
so just take good care of yourself.

98
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:14,870
Thank you for coming on such short notice.

99
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:17,290
I thought

100
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:20,750
it'd be more appropriate
to speak to all of you in person.

101
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,840
You basically slammed the door
in my face yesterday.

102
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:25,050
Why are you all polite today?

103
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:28,390
I wonder why she summoned us all.
Let's hear what she has to say.

104
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,850
I'm sure you all know

105
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:35,230
about the commotion
at Mr. Seol's jazz bar last night.

106
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:38,100
I'll tell you why that happened.

107
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,480
Seol Min-jun

108
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:43,730
was a police spy.

109
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:45,570
What?

110
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:47,110
What did you say?

111
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:50,030
Gosh, what kind of nonsense is that?

112
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,030
My goodness.

113
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,830
This is not an occasion for jokes.

114
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:54,830
Are we some gossipy neighbors?

115
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:58,420
Vice-Chairman Hwang Deuk-gu
found out about it.

116
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,500
There's evidence to back it up.

117
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:04,630
Gosh, the timing is just unbelievable.

118
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:10,340
The money just vanished overnight
as soon as Chairman Ko passed away.

119
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:14,810
And it turns out, this gangster dude
was actually a civil servant.

120
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:16,350
What's next?

121
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:19,480
Will I be found as a dead body tomorrow?

122
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,020
Well, the evidence you mentioned...

123
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:22,650
Is it trustworthy?

124
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:25,940
-What do you mean?
-It may have been fabricated, you know.

125
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:29,200
Maybe some fucker is trying
to eliminate us one by one.

126
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:34,620
I didn't catch the full sentence.

127
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:39,540
"Some fucker" is trying to do what?

128
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,170
Well, I was just saying...

129
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,760
I can't believe
that Seol Min-jun was actually a cop.

130
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:48,010
Ms. Choi.

131
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:50,930
Tell them.

132
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:53,640
What did you see and hear?

133
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:02,360
I checked the police records
with my own two eyes,

134
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:05,610
and he admitted it as well.

135
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:09,400
Ms. Choi was so angry

136
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,410
that she finished him on the spot.

137
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:15,620
You killed him?

138
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:18,120
I didn't get to check
whether or not I actually finished him.

139
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,920
I don't buy any of this.

140
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:22,540
Hey, Hwang Deuk-gu.

141
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:26,050
It's all good,
but you'd better not cross the line.

142
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:28,210
By the way,

143
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:32,970
some guys stepped in when my boys
and Seol Min-jun's boys were fighting.

144
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:36,890
Even some of the most elite,
seasoned members got whacked.

145
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:38,850
We did manage
to capture one of them alive,

146
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:42,900
but they even got him out.
Who could these people be?

147
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,610
That actually happened?

148
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,360
Does everything you say have to be
a question? You're annoying me.

149
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:56,030
Come on, guys. Don't fight.

150
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:58,870
You know I have a good eye, right?

151
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:03,330
I'll check the situation myself.
Let's meet again after that, okay?

152
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:14,800
We'll go to the junkyard together
later today.

153
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:16,850
You'll be bored but hang in there.

154
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:20,350
Don't say "together"
because I won't be there.

155
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:21,680
Why are you so cranky?

156
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:24,100
I need to see it myself to be really sure.

157
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:27,400
You'll be able to see the site
through Gi-beom's eyes, so take it easy.

158
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,650
We need to see what the eyes can't see.

159
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:32,280
My feelings will be hurt
if I'm being excluded

160
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,030
from the mission
for failing to fight back.

161
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:35,700
What's he saying?

162
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:38,780
We're just worried about you.
You need to take it easy now.

163
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:40,580
Inspect the scene thoroughly.

164
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:43,790
-Don't miss even the littlest things.
-Look at this punk.

165
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:45,580
Don't worry. Just focus on your recovery.

166
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:55,090
FOR WORK, COMFORTABLE OUTFIT

167
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,720
FOR GOING OUT, CASUAL OUTFIT

168
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:03,850
FOR GOING OUT, CASUAL OUTFIT

169
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,690
She did all this work

170
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:10,520
just to make sure
her husband would look good.

171
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:15,950
Come in.

172
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:17,990
Are you ready?

173
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:20,790
Yes, I was just trying
to decide what to wear.

174
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:24,580
I know you'll faithfully follow
Chief Choi's instructions,

175
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,210
but I want to say something
as your team leader.

176
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:29,090
Sure.

177
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:31,210
If things start to get
even a little dangerous,

178
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:34,220
call me right away instead of trying
to sort things out on your own.

179
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,880
Everyone will be worried.

180
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:39,640
Okay, I won't make you worried.

181
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,600
Good.

182
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:46,690
What's that? Is that the notebook
Gwang-cheol was talking about?

183
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:47,940
Yes.

184
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:50,060
It's my wife's.

185
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:53,440
I didn't make much money
back when I was a detective,

186
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:55,610
so she wrote down the things
she wanted to do for me.

187
00:11:56,610 --> 00:11:59,450
Now, this almost looks like
her will to me,

188
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,620
so I'll try to do these things.

189
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:05,410
Gosh, Gwang-cheol was so curious.

190
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,210
To be honest,

191
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,590
it was hard for me to read this
after such a long time.

192
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:15,630
But I should tell him
because we're on the same team now.

193
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:21,850
You wear quirky clothes sometimes
and have teamwork problems,

194
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:25,180
but I'll try to understand.

195
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,390
Thank you.

196
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:29,560
-Have a good day.
-You too.

197
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,510
Kang Gi-beom.

198
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:04,600
Neither of us will stop.

199
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,810
You're still here?

200
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:13,360
Is this your living room or what?

201
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,490
How dare you start cohabiting
with that bitch in this house?

202
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:20,240
Jeez, what a nuisance.

203
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:23,490
I'm trying to work,
and you're interrupting me.

204
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:27,160
I get that you're going bonkers
because you're anxious,

205
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,210
but being rude to me
will get you in trouble.

206
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,250
Get out of Chairman Ko's house.

207
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:39,670
What makes you think
that you have the right

208
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,510
to order me to get out?

209
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:45,430
You bastard, what kind of ruse
are you cooking up?

210
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:47,930
Hey.

211
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:51,640
Do you feel like the world is yours
because we let you win once?

212
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:55,310
We'll never let you
reap all the benefits of our hard work.

213
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:58,400
Do you even know how to work hard?

214
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:02,530
You folks make ends meet
by running your mouths.

215
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:05,490
How dare you. My patience is wearing thin.

216
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:07,540
Boss.

217
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:09,910
I'm here.

218
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:13,250
What are you doing here?

219
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,540
-Hey, Dal-ho.
-Yes, Boss.

220
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:19,300
From now on, do thorough security checks
before letting anyone into the house.

221
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,050
Have you lost your mind?

222
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:23,930
Do you think I'm a big joke?

223
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:27,100
When I say I'll do something,
I follow through. I'm sure you know that.

224
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:29,890
-You talk too much.
-Unless you want bullet holes all over--

225
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:32,230
You see, I would've already fired
at least ten shots.

226
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:33,190
Just shoot me.

227
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:39,570
What are you waiting for? Shoot!

228
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,120
-Dal-ho.
-Yes, Boss.

229
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,120
The guests are leaving. Escort them out.

230
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,750
-Yong, don't be like this--
-Hey, back off.

231
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:55,080
-Yong.
-Fine, let's put an end to this today.

232
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:56,500
Min Dal-ho!

233
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,900
Man-cheol! Are you all right?

234
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,030
What did you do to me just now?

235
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:25,240
Well, that was...

236
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,620
On top of breaking and entering
into Chairman Ko's house,

237
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,040
you even shot a member of the family.

238
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:33,080
I can consider this a coup, right?

239
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:35,750
This is...

240
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:38,000
Help!

241
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,590
We should save him
so that he can be punished. Take him.

242
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:41,750
Yes, Boss.

243
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:43,710
Put him down!

244
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:49,720
Look at you feeling all guilty.

245
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:55,060
You really didn't know?
About Seol Min-jun.

246
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:57,810
"A good-looking, polite guy
who gets things done."

247
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:02,980
You praised him nonstop and said
he'd be useful. He was just that.

248
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:06,740
You've gotten quite gutsy, Ye-won.

249
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:09,950
I have to be this way,
or I'll get eaten up alive.

250
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:14,040
But you still have a long way to go.

251
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:18,210
I did say he'd be useful, but I never
told you to let your guard down.

252
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:20,330
I never let my guard down.

253
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:22,340
Well, anyway...

254
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:25,420
The more I think about it,
the angrier I get.

255
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:27,380
I soiled my hands with blood to groom him.

256
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:31,140
That hypocrite must've acted
all righteous behind our backs.

257
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:32,930
In a way, I'm very impressed.

258
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,980
-He totally fooled us, you know.
-Right.

259
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:39,400
Regardless of his background,
he blended in with us pretty well.

260
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:42,230
And he's made enough money
to not want to go back.

261
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,530
I wonder why he did that.

262
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:47,070
And what about Hwang Deuk-gu
who figured it out?

263
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:48,900
Gosh, Hwang Deuk-gu...

264
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,620
This is all that bastard's fault.

265
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,530
Your husband's death too.

266
00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:00,710
Everyone else is suspecting me.

267
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,380
You're the only exception.

268
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:05,840
Just my gut feeling.

269
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:09,630
It's my secret to surviving amongst men
who have nothing but their fists.

270
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:12,220
I picked you.
Doesn't that tell you enough?

271
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:14,930
What does your gut say?

272
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:18,850
You look all delicate and naive,

273
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:23,690
but you're actually burning
with insatiable ambition deep inside.

274
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,530
People who have that combination
is hard to come by.

275
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,360
That's why you sent me
to Ko Yong-deok as a bribe.

276
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:32,610
"Bribe"? Come on. Watch your words.

277
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:36,450
"Bait" would be a better word.
To catch my prey more easily.

278
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,540
Aren't you afraid of me?

279
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:39,870
You?

280
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:41,620
Me? Afraid of you?

281
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:50,840
I'm sparing you only because
I practically groomed you.

282
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:55,390
I can easily kill you using your affair
with Min-jun. If you don't want that,

283
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:58,600
you'd better behave yourself.

284
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,110
I'd like to plant an informant
inside Argos.

285
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:07,610
Who?

286
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:09,690
Those small flies won't really be helpful.

287
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,400
I already have a plan,

288
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:14,450
which will allow us to infiltrate them
directly without getting ratted out.

289
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:23,620
Even Seol Min-jun wasn't able
to gain Choi Ye-won's total trust.

290
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:26,710
Be careful.

291
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,420
How did you know?

292
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:33,430
I have full control over you.

293
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:36,720
That includes all the information you have
as well as your thoughts.

294
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:41,310
You'll know everything
even without me telling you,

295
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,060
so I won't report the details to you.

296
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:48,980
Use this to contact them.

297
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:51,570
They won't be able to track it.

298
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:12,340
The door.

299
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:16,800
Why did he even open it for me, then?

300
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,940
My gosh, she scared me.

301
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:26,650
Can you be quiet?

302
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:28,650
Okay.

303
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:36,200
You still got those eyes.

304
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,620
It takes skill to let your guard down.

305
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,290
My suit will get all wrinkled
because of you.

306
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:43,790
Get off me, will you?

307
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:49,460
Eyes cannot lie.

308
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:51,130
What is it that you want?

309
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:01,430
You pulled out your knife
before I could even say a word.

310
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:04,390
I'm too scared to talk to you now.

311
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:09,770
I had to test you
to see how gutsy you are .

312
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:14,280
Okay. Then I guess
I don't need to be all polite to you.

313
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:17,650
Can you tell me what you can do for me?

314
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:30,170
What do you do for a living?
I wonder why you're so on edge.

315
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:34,670
You tell me first. You're very nimble.

316
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:38,760
A soldier? Or are you an athlete?

317
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:42,220
My background shouldn't matter
as long as I'm good at my job.

318
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:45,470
I'm a little sensitive about that
these days.

319
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:48,440
I'm like a mercenary.

320
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:52,020
-I hate being tied down to places.
-Perfect.

321
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:56,240
I won't have to take responsibility,
and you'll never feel tied down.

322
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,990
-All right, so what do you do?
-Argos.

323
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:02,240
I'm the new leader of Argos.

324
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:07,370
It's nice to see that surprised face.

325
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,120
Now, you're interested?

326
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:12,920
Of course. If it's true, that is.

327
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:16,000
I need you to protect me.

328
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,380
You said it takes skill to be unguarded.

329
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,800
-You're trusting me too easily.
-You were the first person

330
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:25,810
that helped me
without expecting anything in return.

331
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:29,060
You even risked
putting yourself in danger for me.

332
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:33,940
I don't want to have to explain more.
Just tell me if you'll do it or not.

333
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,650
You'll have to pay me case by case.
Pass me your phone.

334
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,990
And you must book in advance.

335
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:48,580
CASE BY CASE

336
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:52,540
You're my only client, but let's not pry
into each other's personal lives.

337
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,170
If you do a good job,

338
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:57,130
I'll hire you on a permanent basis.

339
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:00,220
I said I hate the feeling
of being tied down.

340
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:01,130
Pull over.

341
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:06,850
-Get out.
-Here?

342
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:09,270
That's your upfront deposit.

343
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:12,850
I won't call more than twice.
Keep your eyes glued to your phone.

344
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,860
What a princess.

345
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:37,670
We shouldn't underestimate Choi Ye-won.

346
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:40,630
That's why Gi-beom is doing this himself.
Let's wait and see.

347
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:43,630
You all saw that, right? My gosh.

348
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:47,600
"So? Now, you're interested?"

349
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:52,020
"I said I hate the feeling
of being tied down."

350
00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:55,060
So cool.

351
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:58,980
I need to...

352
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,740
I need to use the washroom, sir.

353
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:08,740
That was good though.

354
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:23,800
To sum it up,

355
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:27,680
he's now able to enter Argos' lair
whenever Choi Ye-won calls.

356
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:32,850
So meeting Choi Ye-won
is the urgent business he mentioned?

357
00:23:32,930 --> 00:23:35,640
Exactly. It must be because
they're acquainted,

358
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:39,150
but the banter between them
has been quite entertaining.

359
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:41,070
I see.

360
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:45,240
Not even we knew about this
which indicates a secret mission.

361
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:46,820
Are you sure you should be telling us?

362
00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:50,200
I just thought you'd want to know.

363
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:53,410
We never said anything,
so keep things professional.

364
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,500
See you.

365
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:02,670
Damn it. My big mouth
might put me in solitary.

366
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,470
Why would he meet Choi Ye-won by himself?

367
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:08,550
Kang Gi-beom...

368
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:11,430
Do you like him?

369
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:15,600
No.

370
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:18,020
I see.

371
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:30,660
This I want to say to you.

372
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:31,830
What?

373
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:35,450
Even a tiny nick
could hinder my performance.

374
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,580
What are you yapping on about?

375
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:40,420
Isn't a conversation what you wanted?

376
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:49,050
Would you like to converse?

377
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:51,510
Find everything about Hwang Deuk-gu.

378
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:53,930
HWANG DEUK-GU AGE 51
ARGOS VICE-PRESIDENT

379
00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:57,230
You not only talk but can think too?

380
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:59,390
Are you saying you have an identity?

381
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:01,810
You may ignore the words you received

382
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:05,900
from the transplant specialist
at 10:05:57 a.m. this morning.

383
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:07,360
-Who?
-From now on,

384
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,650
I'll address him just like you do.

385
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:14,160
Dr. Oh may have linked memories to dreams,
but his interpretation is wrong.

386
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:16,700
So you're smarter than your creator?

387
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:19,000
My analysis is only based on facts.

388
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,130
Cheeky, aren't you?

389
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:24,540
Gi-beom, are you there?

390
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:27,260
Gwang-cheol.

391
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:29,130
I arrived at the junkyard.

392
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:32,890
Let's have my eyes and your memories
complete the puzzle.

393
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:35,390
Sure. Let's do this.

394
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:38,230
They probably hid everything here.

395
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:43,440
In the past,
reliving my memories was a nightmare,

396
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,730
but now I'd like nothing more
than to be there.

397
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,480
That's the one.

398
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:30,650
Everything has been burned, though.

399
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:32,200
It's what they always do.

400
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,660
You went there for nothing then.

401
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:39,740
Not exactly.
This part of the truck is untouched.

402
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:45,000
I don't know
where to begin investigating though.

403
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:47,880
Where's Tae-woong?
Heavy-lifting is his specialty.

404
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,130
Exactly.

405
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:52,050
What the...

406
00:26:57,390 --> 00:26:59,760
You're the worst kind of person
to have as an enemy.

407
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:04,060
-You're here too.
-Right.

408
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,980
Did something happen? Why the long face?

409
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:12,320
Ask her yourself if you want to know.

410
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:15,450
-What's up?
-Gwang-cheol, what's next?

411
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:18,240
Do you see anything inside?

412
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,450
Tae-woong, can you let us in?

413
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:23,540
-Me?
-Who else?

414
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,040
Come on.

415
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:47,900
Damn it.

416
00:27:54,650 --> 00:27:56,280
Gwang-cheol was right about what he saw.

417
00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:00,240
What I don't get is this though.

418
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,620
I clearly remember hearing orders

419
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:04,870
to freeze and then pulverize.

420
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:10,840
So instead of hiding the body,
it was burned here.

421
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:14,840
It's for us to see. They're taunting us.

422
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:17,130
If we spend our resources
identifying the victims,

423
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:19,220
notifying the family, and investigating...

424
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:22,310
We'll be playing right into their hands.

425
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:24,220
They're hoping we'd do all the work.

426
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,560
Bastards.

427
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:32,320
You think you can laugh
after doing such a thing?

428
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:35,030
Let's see if you can keep
that smile on your face.

429
00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:44,160
Look at this. I had no idea
there was such a place.

430
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:47,040
What's so surprising about a hospital?

431
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:49,170
Tell me.

432
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:51,170
What are you planning in here?

433
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:53,840
Well,

434
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:58,550
we fix people

435
00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:01,800
and treat them with medicine.

436
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:05,100
If that doesn't do it, we even perform

437
00:29:06,810 --> 00:29:08,270
acupuncture.

438
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:19,360
What the fuck did you do to me?

439
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:22,120
Stings, doesn't it?

440
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:24,950
-Endure it if you want to get better.
-What?

441
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:27,290
You don't care about the organization

442
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:30,420
and are selfish to the bone.

443
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:34,540
You have no vision

444
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:38,630
and only do the least
that is expected of you.

445
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:41,840
You're a cancer, Choi Yong.

446
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,220
Carving you out is how we survive.

447
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,730
You're the one who killed the Chairman.

448
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:54,610
I know it was you, you ungrateful bastard.

449
00:29:54,690 --> 00:29:57,030
-Where's your proof?
-Choi Ye-won

450
00:29:57,940 --> 00:29:59,780
is on top of your head.

451
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:02,570
You'll never be able to fully control her.

452
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:03,820
As if you know what I want.

453
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:09,540
You want to destroy the organization.

454
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:12,420
You think I don't know?

455
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:13,960
Listen up.

456
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:18,670
Argos is only a stepping-stone
to my true objective.

457
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:23,970
What's important though is that

458
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,680
even I don't know how high I'd like to go.

459
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,690
Where are you keeping
the list of lobbied politicians?

460
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,020
There's no such thing.

461
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,270
Did you think I wouldn't know?

462
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:40,740
Someone as skittish as you
is bound to have a ledger.

463
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:47,200
I've already discussed it
with Chairman Hyeon,

464
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:48,790
so stay down.

465
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,870
You now have two minutes.

466
00:30:55,170 --> 00:30:56,080
Make your choice.

467
00:30:58,090 --> 00:30:59,880
Either let your head explode

468
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:05,180
or write everything down
and live as a puppet.

469
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:13,480
Okay, fine. I'll tell you everything,

470
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,890
so take these out!

471
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,480
Start writing.

472
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:19,570
Make sure the letters are neat and tidy.

473
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:57,480
VIP SAFE AT MOPIN, UNIT 1004

474
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:01,270
Why keep a weapon at hand
if you're not going to use it?

475
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:06,910
You should

476
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:08,910
also step up your game.

477
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:10,620
Yes, of course.

478
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:23,380
Fucking idiots.

479
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:26,010
A total of four victims.

480
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:27,510
None of the bodies are fully intact.

481
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:31,260
They're all missing at least
one organ or body parts

482
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:33,220
that were removed surgically.

483
00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:35,060
They were harvested.

484
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:37,730
The bodies were then frozen

485
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:39,730
to cover the smell of decay.

486
00:32:39,810 --> 00:32:42,440
I'm sorry to tell you this,
but all four of them

487
00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:44,150
were police.

488
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:48,740
They were officers of detectives that
went missing while investigating Argos.

489
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:51,320
They'll be reported as corrupt officers.

490
00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:53,030
Ones that worked for Argos

491
00:32:53,790 --> 00:32:56,000
who were abandoned
after serving their purpose.

492
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,540
Instead of being undercover officers?

493
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:00,080
The truth has no value.

494
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:02,130
Lies will be spread to make

495
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,840
them seem like evil corrupt officers.

496
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:07,010
You've got to give credit
for their craftiness.

497
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,220
Track the refrigerator truck

498
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:11,930
and come up with possible locations
to where they kept their victims.

499
00:33:12,010 --> 00:33:14,720
Susan, I want the names
and contact information

500
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:16,100
of the fallen police officers.

501
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:17,480
Yes, sir.

502
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:25,690
Isn't it suspicious
how all the undercover police officers

503
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:27,940
showed up in one place?

504
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:30,110
Because they're not scared
of the police at all.

505
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:32,120
This is a message.

506
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,620
They're taunting us

507
00:33:34,910 --> 00:33:37,750
while also provoking us.

508
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:50,130
I think I finally understand
why you didn't offer

509
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:52,260
to clear my name first.

510
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,680
What do you mean?

511
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:56,930
The truth holds no value.

512
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,190
They should know though

513
00:34:01,810 --> 00:34:03,560
that the truth does matter.

514
00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:06,730
Of course.

515
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:10,400
It must've been a hard battle for you.

516
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:13,030
You had to form a team,

517
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:14,740
have officers infiltrate Argos,

518
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:17,660
and fight off those coming at you
from all corners.

519
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:20,410
I only tried my best

520
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:22,250
because I had a mission.

521
00:34:22,330 --> 00:34:25,250
How about I add rocket fuel to your tank?

522
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:27,750
I'll put my trust in you,

523
00:34:28,050 --> 00:34:30,090
not go rogue on any of the missions,

524
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:31,170
and promise my loyalty.

525
00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:35,800
And here I was thinking about using
that temper of yours to my advantage.

526
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:37,600
As you please.

527
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:10,760
-Well, that was one smart move.
-Of course.

528
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,800
-Jeez.
-Make your move already.

529
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,800
-Here?
-There you go.

530
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:17,600
-What's this?
-What?

531
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:23,640
-What is it?
-What's going on?

532
00:35:24,810 --> 00:35:26,690
Wait, hold this.

533
00:35:26,770 --> 00:35:27,980
Yes, sir.

534
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,360
-What is it?
-My gosh!

535
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:35,450
My goodness.

536
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:37,160
My gosh.

537
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,950
Oh, dear.

538
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,450
My gosh.

539
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:43,660
That...

540
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,460
I can't believe it.

541
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,420
-What was that?
-Gosh.

542
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:48,710
-My goodness.
-My gosh.

543
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:56,680
Right.

544
00:35:59,470 --> 00:36:01,430
-Have the bosses been informed?
-Yes.

545
00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:04,520
The media will soon
get a hold of the news as well.

546
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:08,350
It'll be better if you try
to put a lid on this yourself.

547
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:10,610
-Right.
-Sir.

548
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:13,730
Is Gi-beom

549
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,280
doing well?

550
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,450
Yes, somewhat.

551
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:19,740
Is there anything I can do to help?

552
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:23,120
You're already doing what you can
in your position.

553
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:45,890
What's that, sir?

554
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,160
What is it?

555
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:02,830
Isn't he the guy from the jazz bar?

556
00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:08,750
What did he ever do to deserve this?

557
00:37:08,830 --> 00:37:10,790
He uploaded a video for his fans

558
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,920
explaining why the performance
was interrupted.

559
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:16,380
Guys, I'm Lee Jae-han.

560
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:19,470
You will not believe
what just happened here.

561
00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:21,840
Our performance has been called off.

562
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:24,810
I'll explain why when I can.

563
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:27,930
He never mentioned Argos by name.

564
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:30,480
It doesn't really matter
because whatever he said

565
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:32,400
could've implicated the organization.

566
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,480
Sick bastards.

567
00:37:34,570 --> 00:37:35,900
Without emotions,

568
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:38,320
one can never see the truth.

569
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:41,280
Hold on a second.

570
00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:45,580
I see. It's a job well done.

571
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,450
What? What do you mean?

572
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:50,460
Wax was used to shape the skull and...

573
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:52,120
Wait. Hold on.

574
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:55,630
The skin is from a human though.

575
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:57,920
No wonder the head looked so real.

576
00:37:58,010 --> 00:37:59,630
It's a fake, guys.

577
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:01,880
How detailed it is

578
00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:04,220
indicates that his face
wasn't copied off a photo.

579
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,140
He must've been kidnapped.

580
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:07,770
Then he'll still be alive.

581
00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:09,680
We must find him as soon as possible then.

582
00:38:09,770 --> 00:38:11,060
He could actually die.

583
00:38:11,850 --> 00:38:13,310
-Susan?
-Yes, sir.

584
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,820
This is the lead I found.

585
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,780
It's a closed factory.

586
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:23,530
According to Detective Yang,
he's the man who delivered the box.

587
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:25,620
He went off the grid from here

588
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:27,580
and resurfaced two hours later

589
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:29,410
to drop off the box.

590
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:32,670
The police is looking from him
as we speak.

591
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:34,170
Is that place...

592
00:38:35,130 --> 00:38:36,000
That's right.

593
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:39,300
It's the place we've been searching for
and the one we must shut down.

594
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:41,840
That's probably
where they took Lee Jae-han.

595
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,800
Is this a rescue operation

596
00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:45,680
or must we even crush the place?

597
00:38:46,930 --> 00:38:48,890
Those who taunt us

598
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:50,390
should see

599
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:52,140
what we're capable of.

600
00:38:52,890 --> 00:38:54,520
All responsibilities will be mine to bear.

601
00:38:56,730 --> 00:38:59,030
Then are we allowed to take lives?

602
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:02,610
The factory is in a remote area.

603
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,780
I'll only read your after-report.

604
00:39:06,990 --> 00:39:08,370
We'll make sure everyone lives.

605
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:10,790
Move out.

606
00:39:11,370 --> 00:39:12,200
Yes, sir.

607
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:29,890
Lee Jae-han, the leader of
a famous jazz team has gone missing.

608
00:39:30,850 --> 00:39:34,810
Mr. Lee recently posted a video explaining
why his latest show was canceled.

609
00:39:34,890 --> 00:39:38,190
His agency hasn't been able
to get in touch with Mr. Lee since.

610
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:41,030
The police have immediately
launched a search operation

611
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:44,740
and they have openly dismissed
the gruesome rumor regarding

612
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:47,870
the involvement of body hunters
that have been terrorizing people online.

613
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,660
We relaunch this investigation

614
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:51,910
to show how our thoughts
are with the bereaved.

615
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:53,870
From what we know so far,

616
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:56,620
this particular case has revealed

617
00:39:56,710 --> 00:40:00,340
no ties to a certain criminal organization
despite what many believe.

618
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:02,880
DISMANTLE THE PUPPET OF A POLICE FORCE

619
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,380
SUPPORTED BY 273,948 PEOPLE

620
00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:06,300
We want proper police.

621
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:08,720
We want to see action,
not hear your words.

622
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,180
I can't send my kids anywhere.

623
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:12,350
-Who knows what can happen?
-Where's the prosecution?

624
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:13,970
-Where's the prosecution?
-You should

625
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:16,190
-watch what you write.
-Dismiss the incompetent

626
00:40:16,270 --> 00:40:18,060
-team leader.
-Even I'd be

627
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:19,690
-scared of Argos.
-What's Argos?

628
00:40:19,770 --> 00:40:21,270
A nation must protect its citizens.

629
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,900
I'm too scared to leave my house.

630
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:24,280
YOU HAVE SUPPORTED THE PETITION

631
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:27,110
The now emotional victims

632
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:29,870
have been raising their voices.

633
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:33,370
Finally, it's the moment
we've been waiting for.

634
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:37,080
Are you saying we should
bring Rugal from out of the shadows?

635
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:39,830
The bosses want results.

636
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:43,800
Whatever you have
that'll shock the public,

637
00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:46,170
we'll take.

638
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:49,140
May I take what you just said

639
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:51,010
and interpret it my own way?

640
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:52,470
By all means.

641
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:38,310
What is all this?

642
00:41:39,690 --> 00:41:41,230
Are those people?

643
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:49,990
Damn it.

644
00:41:51,530 --> 00:41:53,450
This is how they hid the bodies.

645
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,660
There may be more.

646
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:58,750
Bastards. How many have they killed?

647
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:11,970
Should we look around?

648
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:23,900
Wait.

649
00:42:24,730 --> 00:42:26,400
That seems refrigerated too.

650
00:42:37,030 --> 00:42:38,740
It doesn't match what's on the blueprint.

651
00:42:39,950 --> 00:42:41,330
These were newly built.

652
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:43,710
So they built refrigerated warehouses,

653
00:42:43,790 --> 00:42:45,790
stored corpses in them,

654
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,130
and then built more?

655
00:42:47,210 --> 00:42:49,300
They built more when they needed more.

656
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:51,970
This entire factory
could be a big burial site.

657
00:42:52,050 --> 00:42:53,970
Let's check the basement.

658
00:43:20,330 --> 00:43:23,210
Hey, you. Come out
when we're asking you nicely.

659
00:43:33,170 --> 00:43:34,680
My gosh.

660
00:43:49,570 --> 00:43:51,980
-He's still alive.
-I'll call an ambulance.

661
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:57,620
Why is there no connection?

662
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:20,510
Isn't that the sound
of a refrigerator motor?

663
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:22,010
They're trying to freeze us alive.

664
00:44:24,350 --> 00:44:27,100
We're running out of time, guys.

665
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:29,560
Try punching your way out.

666
00:44:29,650 --> 00:44:30,480
Sure.

667
00:44:35,030 --> 00:44:36,320
It's not your everyday wall.

668
00:44:36,490 --> 00:44:38,530
Tae-woong, you could have better luck.

669
00:44:43,490 --> 00:44:45,830
I could get through, but it'll take time.

670
00:44:46,790 --> 00:44:49,540
We'll probably all die while waiting.

671
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:53,050
Shit.

672
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:00,550
It's not like we don't have a way.

673
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:03,760
What is it? Speak up.

674
00:45:04,850 --> 00:45:06,430
It's too brutal though.

675
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:08,310
It doesn't matter, so just tell us.

676
00:45:08,890 --> 00:45:11,400
Not right now.
Let's think of another way first.

677
00:45:11,690 --> 00:45:13,570
There isn't another way, so tell us.

678
00:45:15,230 --> 00:45:17,490
Just consider this
as one of the options then.

679
00:45:17,570 --> 00:45:19,530
Only decide after hearing me out.

680
00:45:20,110 --> 00:45:22,780
I watched the entire process
of Gwang-cheol's surgery

681
00:45:22,870 --> 00:45:26,410
and the our transplanted body parts
can be modified

682
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:28,040
to be turned into explosives.

683
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:40,050
I'm in. I have a number
of artificial organs within me.

684
00:45:40,130 --> 00:45:41,890
We'll modify one into an explosive.

685
00:45:41,970 --> 00:45:43,680
No can do.

686
00:45:44,050 --> 00:45:46,350
-Why not?
-Because your organs are all connected.

687
00:45:46,430 --> 00:45:48,520
It won't be easy to safely remove just one

688
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:50,520
especially since you're still recovering.

689
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:55,400
That leaves my eyes and Tae-woong's arm.

690
00:45:56,150 --> 00:45:58,110
You'll have to modify the body part
into a bomb.

691
00:45:58,190 --> 00:45:59,650
Tae-woong...

692
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:02,160
I have two eyes,

693
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:03,530
-so one--
-Enough.

694
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:04,740
Tae-woong, are you nuts?

695
00:46:04,830 --> 00:46:05,700
Tae-woong!

696
00:46:12,290 --> 00:46:13,250
Are you sure about this?

697
00:46:13,830 --> 00:46:15,840
I don't know
how to make it less painful though.

698
00:46:16,420 --> 00:46:19,130
You probably know this,
but your arm has been welded on.

699
00:46:20,090 --> 00:46:21,630
Are you sure you can endure the pain?

700
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:23,840
-Let's be rational--
-Gwang-cheol, shut it.

701
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:28,310
Do it before I change my mind.

702
00:46:31,730 --> 00:46:33,100
I'm putting my trust in you.

703
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:34,980
Do it fast.

704
00:46:42,490 --> 00:46:44,070
I'll do it on the count of three.

705
00:46:49,410 --> 00:46:50,290
One...

706
00:46:52,750 --> 00:46:53,670
Two.

707
00:46:56,540 --> 00:46:57,670
Two and a half.

708
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:01,170
Two and a half. I can't.

709
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:03,430
I really can't do this.

710
00:47:04,130 --> 00:47:06,300
I'm the one who'll feel the pain,
so what's wrong?

711
00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:08,930
My heart breaks even when I cut
my dog's toenails,

712
00:47:09,010 --> 00:47:10,600
so how do you expect me to do this?

713
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:11,520
What?

714
00:47:11,930 --> 00:47:13,190
"Dog"?

715
00:47:13,270 --> 00:47:15,400
I'm not calling you one.

716
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:18,480
Anyway, I'm sure we can find
another way to go about this.

717
00:47:18,570 --> 00:47:20,690
Hey, if you want to take your revenge,

718
00:47:20,780 --> 00:47:22,320
you better listen to me.

719
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:25,530
I know you're the type who'll do anything

720
00:47:25,990 --> 00:47:27,120
to fulfill your wish.

721
00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:30,700
I don't need you to feel sorry for me.

722
00:47:30,790 --> 00:47:32,910
And I have no plans to whine about this.

723
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:34,710
So do it right now.

724
00:47:35,250 --> 00:47:36,120
Got it?

725
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:40,340
-Are you sure about this?
-I'm just as desperate as you are.

726
00:47:41,550 --> 00:47:43,130
If my arm doesn't work,

727
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:45,180
your eyes will be next.

728
00:47:45,260 --> 00:47:47,590
I'll take both of them out if I have to.

729
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:54,690
Go.

730
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:03,940
I'll do it on the count of three.

731
00:48:06,150 --> 00:48:07,360
One.

732
00:48:08,410 --> 00:48:09,280
Two.

733
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:11,660
Tae-woong, are you okay?

734
00:48:11,830 --> 00:48:13,120
-Gwang-cheol.
-Yes.

735
00:48:16,370 --> 00:48:17,460
This is crazy.

736
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:21,880
Are you okay?

737
00:48:32,350 --> 00:48:33,970
If it doesn't go off,

738
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:36,730
I will

739
00:48:37,350 --> 00:48:39,060
kill you with my own hands.

740
00:48:39,150 --> 00:48:40,270
It'll work.

741
00:48:52,370 --> 00:48:53,330
Be careful.

742
00:49:10,140 --> 00:49:11,260
Gwang-cheol, take him.

743
00:49:11,350 --> 00:49:12,180
Okay.

744
00:49:28,570 --> 00:49:30,990
Mi-na, escort him out of here.
I'll take care of this.

745
00:49:31,070 --> 00:49:32,120
Okay.

746
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:13,450
Seol Min-jun might be dumped here as well.

747
00:50:16,830 --> 00:50:19,960
Let me see the regular reports on him.

748
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:22,870
SEOL MIN-JUN

749
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:25,670
Let me see the ones related
to Hwang Deuk-gu.

750
00:50:25,750 --> 00:50:27,210
PURCHASED A GALLERY IN SEOUL-INCHEON

751
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:29,800
FUND TRACKING

752
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:31,260
AN EYE FOR BEAUTY, OWNS A GALLERY

753
00:50:33,090 --> 00:50:34,800
"An eye for beauty," my foot.

754
00:50:37,140 --> 00:50:38,270
"Gallery"?

755
00:50:42,770 --> 00:50:44,730
Tae-woong, stay with me.

756
00:50:45,310 --> 00:50:46,400
Hang in there.

757
00:50:50,740 --> 00:50:53,070
I'm fine. It's bearable.

758
00:51:04,540 --> 00:51:07,170
Dr. Oh, please take care of him

759
00:51:08,170 --> 00:51:09,170
first.

760
00:51:09,250 --> 00:51:10,550
Your condition isn't any better.

761
00:51:17,510 --> 00:51:18,810
Once again,

762
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:22,270
thank you.

763
00:51:22,350 --> 00:51:24,100
Let's create another miracle.

764
00:51:24,940 --> 00:51:26,520
-Bradley?
-Yes, doctor.

765
00:51:42,450 --> 00:51:44,870
-Where's Gi-beom?
-He's not back yet.

766
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:48,000
He's investigating
the full extent of the damage.

767
00:51:48,340 --> 00:51:50,250
-Put me through.
-Yes, sir.

768
00:51:55,590 --> 00:51:58,300
What? I can't connect to him.

769
00:51:58,970 --> 00:52:00,760
What do you mean?

770
00:52:00,850 --> 00:52:04,020
Something is preventing us
from connecting.

771
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:05,390
This can't be.

772
00:52:05,690 --> 00:52:06,900
Keep trying.

773
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:08,860
If it's an error, it can be fixed.

774
00:52:09,150 --> 00:52:11,780
If it's intentional,
there must be a pattern.

775
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:13,070
Find it out.

776
00:53:10,130 --> 00:53:12,630
CASE BY CASE

777
00:54:24,490 --> 00:54:25,910
Kang Gi-beom.

778
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:44,430
You're living quite the sophisticated life

779
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:46,140
for a murderer.

780
00:54:47,220 --> 00:54:48,560
Would you like some wine?

781
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:50,640
I have my favorite.

782
00:54:52,140 --> 00:54:54,350
Oh, right.

783
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:58,530
Are you still working right now?

784
00:54:59,030 --> 00:55:01,650
I don't set aside time
to catch scumbags like you.

785
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:03,860
I catch them whenever I see one.

786
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:07,530
Maybe it's because you barely avoided
getting frozen to death.

787
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:10,950
You look quite excited and confident.

788
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:13,080
Your men were so weak.

789
00:55:13,670 --> 00:55:15,960
That's why I came to you.

790
00:55:16,580 --> 00:55:19,170
-You're desperate to meet me.
-If you hadn't visited me,

791
00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:24,300
I was going to visit you myself.
Thank you for sparing me that trouble.

792
00:55:24,380 --> 00:55:25,390
What do you want?

793
00:55:26,510 --> 00:55:28,640
Why are you doing all this for?

794
00:55:31,180 --> 00:55:33,690
When it comes to my work,

795
00:55:33,980 --> 00:55:35,850
you guys keep me busy,

796
00:55:36,860 --> 00:55:38,440
add meaning to everything that I do,

797
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:42,070
and analyze it.

798
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:45,950
But then again, they're all bullshit.

799
00:55:46,070 --> 00:55:50,160
But I have to say, I liked that question.

800
00:55:51,490 --> 00:55:54,080
I also liked how you acknowledged
your ignorance.

801
00:55:55,210 --> 00:55:57,460
I could feel your sincerity

802
00:55:57,830 --> 00:55:59,710
of wanting to know about me.

803
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:03,300
Nice timing.

804
00:56:04,010 --> 00:56:06,220
I have a bit of free time right now,

805
00:56:06,380 --> 00:56:07,800
so I can be patient.

806
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:10,510
Blabber all you want.

807
00:56:17,190 --> 00:56:18,230
Sir.

808
00:56:18,730 --> 00:56:21,230
What do you mean you can't locate Gi-beom?

809
00:56:22,530 --> 00:56:23,990
We're still locating him.

810
00:56:25,490 --> 00:56:27,280
We shouldn't have left him there alone.

811
00:56:27,410 --> 00:56:29,450
There could've been more traps.

812
00:56:29,820 --> 00:56:32,160
Give us your order,
and we'll go look for him.

813
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:34,790
The AI has begun to whisper.

814
00:56:36,210 --> 00:56:37,250
"Whisper"?

815
00:56:38,210 --> 00:56:39,790
He's acting out.

816
00:56:40,380 --> 00:56:42,130
He must have a reason for acting that way.

817
00:56:42,210 --> 00:56:45,010
Isn't that dangerous?

818
00:56:45,670 --> 00:56:46,550
We should stop him.

819
00:56:46,630 --> 00:56:49,550
No. If he uses it well,
we may be able to reach

820
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:51,180
our destination more quickly.

821
00:56:51,850 --> 00:56:53,390
Even if he's acting out,

822
00:56:53,470 --> 00:56:56,430
there's only one thing that he wants.

823
00:56:57,850 --> 00:56:58,900
How many people

824
00:56:59,690 --> 00:57:04,230
do you think actually know what they want?

825
00:57:04,730 --> 00:57:06,530
I want to sleep when I'm tired

826
00:57:06,740 --> 00:57:08,320
and eat when I'm hungry.

827
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:12,490
I also want to beat the shit
out of scumbags like you.

828
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:14,240
That's not hard, is it?

829
00:57:14,790 --> 00:57:16,660
My wishes are very simple.

830
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:18,670
I like you

831
00:57:19,710 --> 00:57:20,830
for now.

832
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:24,090
It may be difficult to believe,

833
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:28,550
but I wanted an ordinary life.

834
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:31,140
I wanted to go to school,

835
00:57:31,550 --> 00:57:32,640
have friends,

836
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:34,140
and find a job.

837
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:36,100
It may sound boring,

838
00:57:36,470 --> 00:57:38,310
but such is life.

839
00:57:39,350 --> 00:57:40,600
But

840
00:57:42,230 --> 00:57:44,270
after having blood on my hands
for the first time,

841
00:57:45,730 --> 00:57:48,110
a new world opened up.

842
00:57:48,780 --> 00:57:49,990
I could never

843
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:52,820
go back.

844
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:55,290
I could never turn back time.

845
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:00,210
I felt exhilarated.

846
00:58:01,540 --> 00:58:05,750
Gosh, you really know how to sugarcoat
"I'm crazy."

847
00:58:11,010 --> 00:58:13,340
The difference is that this society
allowed you to do it.

848
00:58:14,260 --> 00:58:16,100
When you were a cop,

849
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:20,390
you were also trained
to be violent and destructive.

850
00:58:21,140 --> 00:58:22,850
You must've loved it so much

851
00:58:23,190 --> 00:58:26,730
to repeat the same thing
after coming back from the dead.

852
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:29,280
There are things I need to put an end to.

853
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:30,990
And you're one of them.

854
00:58:32,070 --> 00:58:33,070
See?

855
00:58:33,660 --> 00:58:36,080
We're special to each other.

856
00:58:36,660 --> 00:58:39,750
Thanks to my existence,
you believe you're being righteous

857
00:58:39,830 --> 00:58:42,120
and justify your actions.

858
00:58:42,210 --> 00:58:43,120
Aren't I right?

859
00:58:43,210 --> 00:58:45,000
What are you? A philosophical thug?

860
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:46,920
But you see,

861
00:58:47,420 --> 00:58:48,710
there's something you don't know.

862
00:58:49,510 --> 00:58:51,170
You're just garbage.

863
00:58:52,090 --> 00:58:54,090
We're special to each other?
I justify my actions?

864
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:56,890
Don't be absurd.

865
00:58:57,470 --> 00:59:00,140
You're probably the chattiest murderer
of all time.

866
00:59:03,190 --> 00:59:06,190
It's a shame that you lack dignity.

867
00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:09,070
You'll become an excellent pacemaker.

868
00:59:09,650 --> 00:59:11,440
Do chase me to the ends of the earth.

869
00:59:11,530 --> 00:59:12,780
I'm going to put my trust in you

870
00:59:12,860 --> 00:59:15,780
and become freer.

871
00:59:15,870 --> 00:59:19,740
Sure thing. I'll make sure you get
enough books to read behind bars.

872
00:59:19,830 --> 00:59:22,500
I hope you live a long, delusional life.

873
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:25,080
To thank you for making this trip,

874
00:59:25,750 --> 00:59:29,050
I've prepared a gift. You'll love it.

875
00:59:40,100 --> 00:59:40,930
Seol Min-jun?

876
00:59:41,770 --> 00:59:43,020
Say hi.

877
00:59:43,850 --> 00:59:45,850
He's a former senior of yours.

878
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:49,110
But now, he's a brother of mine

879
00:59:52,150 --> 00:59:53,360
who'll kill you.

880
01:00:02,410 --> 01:00:04,000
-Please spare us!
-Please spare us!

881
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:07,500
-Please spare us!
-Please spare us!

882
01:00:07,580 --> 01:00:08,460
Please spare us!

883
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:10,130
We won't do that anymore!

884
01:00:10,210 --> 01:00:11,550
-Please spare us!
-I promise!

885
01:00:11,630 --> 01:00:15,760
-Please spare us!
-Please spare us!

886
01:00:16,260 --> 01:00:17,760
Please spare us! Please!

887
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:21,470
If you go right now,
you'll be able to save them.

888
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:23,390
I'll give you their location.

889
01:00:23,470 --> 01:00:25,270
It's not that far from here either.

890
01:00:25,890 --> 01:00:27,560
But if you fail,

891
01:00:29,810 --> 01:00:33,320
it'll cause quite a commotion since
their parents are high-ranking officials.

892
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:35,190
We won't do that ever again!

893
01:00:56,380 --> 01:00:57,300
Is it

894
01:00:57,760 --> 01:00:59,180
really that difficult?

895
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:03,510
Just do as you please.
You're not an idiot, are you?

896
01:01:04,060 --> 01:01:06,640
You can take me,

897
01:01:06,730 --> 01:01:10,310
or you can save them.

898
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:12,820
-What's your answer?
-I'm going to do both.

899
01:01:25,330 --> 01:01:27,540
Move aside. I don't want to hurt you.

900
01:01:43,300 --> 01:01:45,220
We don't have much time to enjoy.

901
01:01:46,140 --> 01:01:47,230
For you

902
01:01:48,020 --> 01:01:49,270
and me.

903
01:02:56,340 --> 01:02:58,250
He wasn't going to let anyone live,
to begin with.

904
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:00,880
The victims or us,
who went there to save them.

905
01:03:00,970 --> 01:03:02,630
We can't be the only ones that suffer.

906
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:05,090
You don't have to know
why you have to do this.

907
01:03:05,180 --> 01:03:06,470
Just let them hear about it.

908
01:03:06,680 --> 01:03:10,020
You want an incident
that will make them get scared of you.

909
01:03:10,100 --> 01:03:11,930
I'll handle Hwang Deuk-gu after that.

910
01:03:13,020 --> 01:03:13,940
It's a reservoir.

911
01:03:15,060 --> 01:03:18,230
Let me first hear what you saw
and how you found it.

912
01:03:18,730 --> 01:03:22,280
Isn't destroying them to the root
the real revenge?

913
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:26,120
You don't have the right
to die peacefully.

914
01:03:28,910 --> 01:03:30,910
