<b>THE KING: ETERNAL MONARCH</b>

2
00:00:14,461 --> 00:00:15,837
<b>JEONG TAE-EUL</b>

3
00:00:15,921 --> 00:00:17,714
<i><b>I'm bored, let's play pool.</i></b>

4
00:00:22,177 --> 00:00:24,638
<b>EPISODE 5</b>

5
00:00:27,557 --> 00:00:28,642
<b>Thank you for your kindness.</b>

6
00:00:29,226 --> 00:00:30,936
<b>I should repay you in cash,</b>

7
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:33,814
<b>but our worlds had different bills,
so I got you goods instead.</b>

8
00:00:37,317 --> 00:00:39,569
<b>I hope you can get a satisfactory price.</b>

9
00:00:44,866 --> 00:00:46,451
<b>Where did you get this?</b>

10
00:00:46,535 --> 00:00:48,537
<b>Did you find oil in your yard
or something?</b>

11
00:00:56,711 --> 00:00:57,712
<b>Oh, Sin-jae.</b>

12
00:00:57,796 --> 00:00:59,464
<b>Can I get a sweet milk tea?</b>

13
00:01:01,424 --> 00:01:02,759
<b>I guess Squad Three is off duty tomorrow.</b>

14
00:01:02,843 --> 00:01:04,678
<b>Yes, I was thinking of playing pool.</b>

15
00:01:05,929 --> 00:01:07,764
<b>I don't see the horse that was here.</b>

16
00:01:07,848 --> 00:01:10,100
<b>Maximus? It's been gone for a while.</b>

17
00:01:13,186 --> 00:01:16,439
<b>Everyone's been asking,
so I even wrote it on the sign out front.</b>

18
00:01:22,529 --> 00:01:24,322
<b>But Tae-eul isn't here.</b>

19
00:01:25,365 --> 00:01:26,700
<b>Who are you playing pool with?</b>

20
00:01:27,993 --> 00:01:30,245
<b>-She's not here?
-Maybe she's back.</b>

21
00:01:31,663 --> 00:01:33,498
<b>She left with that King guy a while ago.</b>

22
00:01:36,001 --> 00:01:38,795
<b>THE HORSE ISN'T HERE</b>

23
00:01:46,303 --> 00:01:48,930
<b>I'M BORED, LET'S PLAY POOL</b>

24
00:01:50,807 --> 00:01:51,975
<i><b>Head Court Lady Noh, it's me.</i></b>

25
00:01:53,018 --> 00:01:55,645
<i><b>His Majesty just came back,
and he has a guest.</i></b>

26
00:01:58,815 --> 00:01:59,900
<b>It's a woman.</b>

27
00:02:00,567 --> 00:02:03,737
<b>Tell His Majesty to take a detour,</b>

28
00:02:04,487 --> 00:02:05,822
<b>and use the sea route.</b>

29
00:02:06,907 --> 00:02:09,159
<b>He shouldn't be seen by people.</b>

30
00:02:10,368 --> 00:02:12,829
<b>Don't worry about the palace,
I'll make sure nobody talks.</b>

31
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,214
<b>FOUR TIGER SWORD</b>

32
00:02:34,392 --> 00:02:36,269
<b>I'm the King of the Kingdom of Corea.</b>

33
00:02:39,064 --> 00:02:41,066
<b>And my name, which you cannot say,</b>

34
00:02:44,527 --> 00:02:45,612
<b>is Lee Gon.</b>

35
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:54,704
<b>So</b>

36
00:02:56,414 --> 00:02:57,499
<b>you do have a name.</b>

37
00:03:01,753 --> 00:03:03,713
<b>If you really have a name,</b>

38
00:03:05,715 --> 00:03:07,926
<b>I guess there's no way
to avoid a beheading now.</b>

39
00:03:11,221 --> 00:03:14,683
<b>From the way you talked to me so far,
it's only right to behead you right away.</b>

40
00:03:20,855 --> 00:03:23,108
<b>-I'll escort you to the palace.
-Let me take care of Maximus first.</b>

41
00:03:24,192 --> 00:03:26,027
<b>The trip had been too long for her age.</b>

42
00:03:27,028 --> 00:03:28,321
<b>Come to the racetracks.</b>

43
00:03:33,284 --> 00:03:35,620
<b>Withdraw the guards from the racetracks
right now.</b>

44
00:03:35,954 --> 00:03:38,081
<b>Two of you go to the control room
and get the security footage.</b>

45
00:03:38,164 --> 00:03:39,082
<b>The rest, follow me.</b>

46
00:04:05,358 --> 00:04:07,235
<b>What is this place?</b>

47
00:04:08,862 --> 00:04:10,697
<b>Is it some kind of a fourth dimension?</b>

48
00:04:11,614 --> 00:04:13,158
<b>I'm not sure yet.</b>

49
00:04:13,742 --> 00:04:17,078
<b>I guess we can say it's something between
1 and 0 in my world and yours.</b>

50
00:04:18,997 --> 00:04:21,124
<b>This is a place that cannot be
explained scientifically.</b>

51
00:04:26,087 --> 00:04:27,213
<b>Do you see that balloon?</b>

52
00:04:28,548 --> 00:04:31,009
<b>Balloons usually pop within ten hours.</b>

53
00:04:31,217 --> 00:04:34,387
<b>But that one has been floating
like that for over ten days.</b>

54
00:04:35,346 --> 00:04:37,515
<b>It hasn't popped or floated away.</b>

55
00:04:38,683 --> 00:04:40,226
<b>It's exactly where I let it go.</b>

56
00:04:41,227 --> 00:04:44,731
<b>That means there's no light,
wind or air here.</b>

57
00:04:45,648 --> 00:04:46,649
<b>Isn't that amazing?</b>

58
00:04:47,358 --> 00:04:48,610
<b>If it's not science, what is it?</b>

59
00:04:49,652 --> 00:04:52,280
<b>Is it some kind of magic?</b>

60
00:04:52,572 --> 00:04:55,366
<b>It could be a part of a legend.</b>

61
00:04:57,243 --> 00:04:58,995
<b>Time flows differently here as well.</b>

62
00:04:59,579 --> 00:05:01,748
<b>One minute here is about an hour outside.</b>

63
00:05:02,499 --> 00:05:04,000
<b>My watch stops here,</b>

64
00:05:04,334 --> 00:05:05,752
<b>so I went back and forth
for several days to check.</b>

65
00:05:07,754 --> 00:05:10,632
<b>How could you check when clocks stop here?</b>

66
00:05:10,965 --> 00:05:12,634
<b>I used Euler's number.</b>

67
00:05:16,054 --> 00:05:17,639
<b>I don't know how deep</b>

68
00:05:19,224 --> 00:05:21,142
<b>or how vast this place is.</b>

69
00:05:22,685 --> 00:05:24,687
<b>I'll reach the edge of this place someday.</b>

70
00:05:25,271 --> 00:05:26,356
<b>And I'll tell you</b>

71
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:28,274
<b>all about it.</b>

72
00:05:28,942 --> 00:05:30,485
<b>But for today, let's go to my world.</b>

73
00:05:44,874 --> 00:05:47,919
<b>Lady Maximus has a lower blood pressure
than last time,</b>

74
00:05:48,002 --> 00:05:51,506
<b>but it's still within a normal range.</b>

75
00:05:52,382 --> 00:05:53,424
<b>"Lady"?</b>

76
00:05:55,885 --> 00:05:57,345
<b>A horse is called a lady...</b>

77
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:00,390
<b>I will do another thorough checkup
in the morning, Your Majesty.</b>

78
00:06:01,057 --> 00:06:02,142
<b>Please do.</b>

79
00:06:12,902 --> 00:06:15,613
<b>I told you so. Everything I said to you
was true, wasn't it?</b>

80
00:06:17,824 --> 00:06:19,784
<b>Don't you see that's driving me crazy?</b>

81
00:06:20,618 --> 00:06:22,829
<b>If this is all real, it's terrifying.</b>

82
00:06:23,621 --> 00:06:25,790
<b>And if it's not, that means I'm crazy.</b>

83
00:06:25,874 --> 00:06:27,083
<b>You should watch your manners.</b>

84
00:06:27,167 --> 00:06:28,793
<b>And that face.</b>

85
00:06:28,877 --> 00:06:30,378
<b>He is supposed to be on my side.</b>

86
00:06:30,962 --> 00:06:32,630
<b>He's been on my side since I was three.</b>

87
00:06:35,884 --> 00:06:37,260
<b>Is that gun real?</b>

88
00:06:37,927 --> 00:06:39,304
<b>Can I take a look at it?</b>

89
00:06:45,059 --> 00:06:46,644
<b>She knows how to handle it. Let her be.</b>

90
00:06:47,437 --> 00:06:49,439
<b>She has to see for herself to believe it.</b>

91
00:06:49,522 --> 00:06:50,690
<b>Believe what?</b>

92
00:06:51,524 --> 00:06:53,109
<b>That she just crossed between 1 and 0.</b>

93
00:07:03,369 --> 00:07:04,704
<b>No way.</b>

94
00:07:06,039 --> 00:07:07,290
<b>This is real?</b>

95
00:07:07,874 --> 00:07:09,417
<b>This P30</b>

96
00:07:10,376 --> 00:07:11,961
<b>is actually real?</b>

97
00:07:15,173 --> 00:07:16,674
<b>I'm going to check something.</b>

98
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,177
<b>It's nothing personal.</b>

99
00:07:30,063 --> 00:07:32,815
<b>I told you. She can handle guns.</b>

100
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:35,485
<b>I'm letting this go just this once
because you're His Majesty's guest.</b>

101
00:07:37,487 --> 00:07:38,363
<b>So...</b>

102
00:07:38,947 --> 00:07:39,989
<b>This country...</b>

103
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:41,991
<b>And you being the King.</b>

104
00:07:42,825 --> 00:07:44,369
<b>It's all real?</b>

105
00:07:45,119 --> 00:07:45,954
<b>It's all real.</b>

106
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:50,458
<b>That gun, this world, and me.</b>

107
00:07:51,709 --> 00:07:53,920
<b>So don't think of confirming that
by pulling the trigger.</b>

108
00:07:54,796 --> 00:07:58,216
<b>This guy isn't going to move an inch.</b>

109
00:07:59,801 --> 00:08:01,010
<b>Loosen your grip</b>

110
00:08:01,844 --> 00:08:03,179
<b>unless you want to get killed.</b>

111
00:08:19,862 --> 00:08:20,822
<b>Your Majesty, is she...</b>

112
00:08:20,905 --> 00:08:21,906
<b>Yes.</b>

113
00:08:22,991 --> 00:08:24,409
<b>She's Lieutenant Jeong Tae-eul.</b>

114
00:08:27,161 --> 00:08:28,121
<b>Do you</b>

115
00:08:28,955 --> 00:08:29,872
<b>know me as well?</b>

116
00:08:52,312 --> 00:08:54,897
<b>Welcome to my palace.</b>

117
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:10,997
<b>This is Gwangyeongjeon.</b>

118
00:09:11,581 --> 00:09:12,582
<b>It's my private residence.</b>

119
00:09:13,499 --> 00:09:15,084
<b>Make yourself at home...</b>

120
00:09:20,131 --> 00:09:21,841
<b>Did you really have to do this?</b>

121
00:09:22,425 --> 00:09:25,261
<b>Are you trying to worry me to death?</b>

122
00:09:25,345 --> 00:09:27,221
<b>Head Court Lady Noh...</b>

123
00:09:27,972 --> 00:09:30,141
<b>I think it has only been
about 10 minutes and 50 seconds</b>

124
00:09:30,266 --> 00:09:32,352
<b>since she believed I'm a king.</b>

125
00:09:35,229 --> 00:09:36,814
<b>She's the important person who knows</b>

126
00:09:37,565 --> 00:09:38,941
<b>where the buttons came from.</b>

127
00:09:41,944 --> 00:09:44,238
<b>It's nice to meet you. I'm--</b>

128
00:09:44,322 --> 00:09:48,368
<b>Put all your belongings here in the box.</b>

129
00:09:51,621 --> 00:09:54,624
<b>Everyone has to go through
a security check when entering the palace.</b>

130
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:58,419
<b>Everyone including the court ladies
and even the Prime Minister.</b>

131
00:10:04,133 --> 00:10:05,593
<b>You reap what you sow.</b>

132
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:21,359
<b>You're giving them back
to me later, right?</b>

133
00:10:21,818 --> 00:10:24,570
<b>I'll be penalized
if I lose my ID card again.</b>

134
00:10:27,949 --> 00:10:29,534
<b>You recognize her face, right?</b>

135
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,370
<b>You're right.</b>

136
00:10:35,623 --> 00:10:38,084
<b>Do I have to get frisked now?</b>

137
00:10:38,167 --> 00:10:39,669
<b>We'll skip that.</b>

138
00:10:40,294 --> 00:10:41,546
<b>I should trust you.</b>

139
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:43,965
<b>You're my King's guest.</b>

140
00:10:47,802 --> 00:10:49,762
<b>Let me talk to you for a moment.</b>

141
00:10:50,263 --> 00:10:51,222
<b>Now?</b>

142
00:10:54,767 --> 00:10:57,478
<b>I'm sure you want to talk later.</b>

143
00:10:58,104 --> 00:11:01,607
<b>But I also would have liked it
if you had left the palace later</b>

144
00:11:01,691 --> 00:11:07,029
<b>and brought a guest according
to the right procedures later.</b>

145
00:11:07,113 --> 00:11:11,784
<b>There were five guards and one person
at the stable who saw her.</b>

146
00:11:11,868 --> 00:11:15,329
<b>Twelve court ladies who would be
suspicious of being</b>

147
00:11:15,413 --> 00:11:16,998
<b>-dismissed suddenly--
-I was on my way.</b>

148
00:11:18,749 --> 00:11:20,960
<b>I needed to talk now anyway.</b>

149
00:11:25,423 --> 00:11:27,133
<b>You should leave, too.</b>

150
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:29,260
<b>It's a King's order.</b>

151
00:11:38,769 --> 00:11:40,021
<b>Don't worry.</b>

152
00:11:40,688 --> 00:11:41,981
<b>Just wait here.</b>

153
00:11:42,148 --> 00:11:45,151
<b>I'll ditch her somehow and come back.</b>

154
00:11:45,234 --> 00:11:47,695
<b>My goodness...</b>

155
00:11:48,905 --> 00:11:50,198
<b>You're really asking for it, aren't you?</b>

156
00:11:54,911 --> 00:11:55,786
<b>I mean,</b>

157
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:58,539
<b>Your Highness.</b>

158
00:12:04,086 --> 00:12:05,630
<b>I guess that was the wrong thing to say.</b>

159
00:12:08,716 --> 00:12:10,051
<b>She really believes it now.</b>

160
00:12:11,928 --> 00:12:13,346
<b>That I'm the King.</b>

161
00:12:24,273 --> 00:12:26,067
<b>My goodness, my head.</b>

162
00:12:26,609 --> 00:12:27,860
<b>Oh, my heart.</b>

163
00:12:28,903 --> 00:12:30,154
<b>My goodness.</b>

164
00:13:06,691 --> 00:13:10,236
<b>You have a meeting at 8 a.m.
regarding the 25th anniversary</b>

165
00:13:10,319 --> 00:13:12,029
<b>of your coronation with the staff.</b>

166
00:13:12,363 --> 00:13:15,950
<b>And you have an appointment for tea
at 10 a.m. with press company CEOs,</b>

167
00:13:16,117 --> 00:13:18,202
<b>then you must make the first throw
at the basketball</b>

168
00:13:18,286 --> 00:13:19,620
<b>season-opening ceremony at 1 p.m.</b>

169
00:13:19,704 --> 00:13:20,663
<b>Hang on.</b>

170
00:13:20,746 --> 00:13:23,249
<b>I left the palace for just half a day,</b>

171
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:25,209
<b>and I have that many things to do?</b>

172
00:13:25,793 --> 00:13:28,754
<b>Maybe someone in the court
has a grudge on you.</b>

173
00:13:31,549 --> 00:13:33,134
<b>-Is there more?
-Yes.</b>

174
00:13:33,634 --> 00:13:35,511
<b>You have a speech to deliver at 2 p.m.</b>

175
00:13:35,595 --> 00:13:37,054
<b>at the International Congress of
Mathematicians.</b>

176
00:13:37,138 --> 00:13:40,474
<b>Then there is a flood relief supply
delivery ceremony at 4 p.m.</b>

177
00:13:40,558 --> 00:13:42,476
<b>You can go there by helicopter.</b>

178
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,644
<b>All right.</b>

179
00:13:44,061 --> 00:13:45,313
<b>I'll do all that,</b>

180
00:13:45,396 --> 00:13:47,189
<b>so please let me eat dinner freely.</b>

181
00:13:47,607 --> 00:13:51,152
<b>It's always suspicious
when you do something on your own.</b>

182
00:13:51,235 --> 00:13:52,862
<b>You're crossing the line now.</b>

183
00:13:53,738 --> 00:13:55,448
<b>I'll be eating by myself in the study.</b>

184
00:13:56,449 --> 00:13:57,575
<b>Alone.</b>

185
00:14:00,578 --> 00:14:02,997
<i><b>There is a guest in His Majesty's study.</i></b>

186
00:14:03,831 --> 00:14:05,875
<i><b>You must keep that guest</i></b>

187
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:08,919
<i><b>locked up in there
until I give other orders.</i></b>

188
00:14:26,771 --> 00:14:28,189
<b>Ironically, my first duty as a king</b>

189
00:14:28,439 --> 00:14:30,566
<b>was to carry out
the funeral of the former king.</b>

190
00:14:31,192 --> 00:14:32,234
<b>It was when I was eight.</b>

191
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:48,292
<b>I'm positive now</b>

192
00:14:49,377 --> 00:14:50,544
<b>that it's a parallel universe.</b>

193
00:14:52,672 --> 00:14:53,547
<b>Pardon?</b>

194
00:14:54,924 --> 00:14:56,008
<b>Na-ri.</b>

195
00:14:57,677 --> 00:14:58,552
<b>Myeong Na-ri.</b>

196
00:14:58,636 --> 00:15:00,513
<b>Who's Myeong Na-ri?</b>

197
00:15:01,681 --> 00:15:04,642
<b>I'm Myeong Seung-a
from the Royal Public Affairs Office.</b>

198
00:15:15,319 --> 00:15:17,238
<b>I know it won't be true,</b>

199
00:15:17,863 --> 00:15:19,532
<b>but I just want to make sure.</b>

200
00:15:20,491 --> 00:15:21,867
<b>Don't you own a building?</b>

201
00:15:22,451 --> 00:15:24,870
<b>Didn't you rent it out
to a Taekwondo center?</b>

202
00:15:27,289 --> 00:15:31,127
<b>I do own buildings,
but they're all in Canada.</b>

203
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:34,255
<b>Would you like some tea?</b>

204
00:15:34,338 --> 00:15:36,132
<b>It's herb tea that will help you
have a good night's sleep.</b>

205
00:15:40,261 --> 00:15:42,805
<b>You want me to fall asleep?</b>

206
00:15:43,097 --> 00:15:44,390
<b>I'd be grateful if you could.</b>

207
00:15:44,473 --> 00:15:46,517
<b>I came here to keep an eye on you,</b>

208
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:50,104
<b>and you won't be able to leave
until Head Court Lady Noh says otherwise.</b>

209
00:15:50,187 --> 00:15:52,314
<b>It will be easy for both of us
if you sleep.</b>

210
00:15:54,525 --> 00:15:56,235
<b>You're really straightforward,</b>

211
00:15:57,445 --> 00:15:59,071
<b>just like Na-ri.</b>

212
00:16:01,323 --> 00:16:02,199
<b>I...</b>

213
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,162
<b>Can I use that laptop over there?</b>

214
00:16:06,412 --> 00:16:09,206
<b>Of course not. You can't use His Majesty's
laptop without his permission.</b>

215
00:16:11,542 --> 00:16:15,504
<b>-It's the year 2019 here, right?
-Yes.</b>

216
00:16:15,588 --> 00:16:18,382
<b>And was this room's owner born in 1987?</b>

217
00:16:18,966 --> 00:16:19,967
<b>Of course.</b>

218
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:22,595
<b>And the cultural capital is Busan,</b>

219
00:16:22,678 --> 00:16:25,097
<b>and there are 63 buildings
called 63 Building.</b>

220
00:16:25,181 --> 00:16:26,974
<b>There's only one 63 Building
in Yeouido, Seoul.</b>

221
00:16:27,057 --> 00:16:27,892
<b>That little jerk.</b>

222
00:16:28,934 --> 00:16:30,895
<b>Did you just swear at me?</b>

223
00:16:34,106 --> 00:16:37,485
<b>What would be the better answer?</b>

224
00:16:42,156 --> 00:16:44,742
<b>Can I have alcohol instead of tea?</b>

225
00:16:45,493 --> 00:16:47,578
<b>I'd love some soju.</b>

226
00:16:50,706 --> 00:16:53,876
<i><b>Your Majesty, where did you go this time?</i></b>

227
00:16:55,503 --> 00:16:56,378
<b>A parallel universe.</b>

228
00:17:23,531 --> 00:17:24,740
<b>Why do you need a laptop?</b>

229
00:17:24,824 --> 00:17:29,036
<b>I wanted to look some stuff up
on the internet.</b>

230
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:35,751
<b>It's a business phone,
so I can't lend it to you.</b>

231
00:17:36,252 --> 00:17:38,963
<b>But if you tell me,
I'll read out the search results for you.</b>

232
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:41,507
<b>I guess that will work.</b>

233
00:17:44,343 --> 00:17:45,302
<b>All right. Then...</b>

234
00:17:46,303 --> 00:17:47,179
<b>Lee Gon.</b>

235
00:17:50,641 --> 00:17:52,101
<b>What did you just say?</b>

236
00:17:52,184 --> 00:17:53,477
<b>Lee Gon.</b>

237
00:17:54,103 --> 00:17:56,689
<b>Isn't the King's name Lee Gon?</b>

238
00:17:56,772 --> 00:17:57,731
<b>Have you lost your mind?</b>

239
00:17:58,399 --> 00:18:01,026
<b>Are you just casually
calling the King's name like that?</b>

240
00:18:02,403 --> 00:18:06,073
<b>You don't even know the 63 Building,
and you don't know the King's age.</b>

241
00:18:08,909 --> 00:18:10,744
<b>Who in the world are you?</b>

242
00:18:11,161 --> 00:18:13,497
<b>Oh, did you live abroad for a long time?</b>

243
00:18:14,164 --> 00:18:15,583
<b>But even so,</b>

244
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:17,835
<b>how could you be so indifferent
toward your home country?</b>

245
00:18:18,586 --> 00:18:19,753
<b>Well...</b>

246
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,756
<b>This isn't my home country.</b>

247
00:18:24,258 --> 00:18:28,762
<b>Well, my earth is still flat for me
so I can't explain.</b>

248
00:18:30,639 --> 00:18:32,308
<b>Let's just say I'm an illegal immigrant.</b>

249
00:18:34,435 --> 00:18:35,477
<b>Oh, my gosh.</b>

250
00:18:43,694 --> 00:18:45,404
<b>Can you leave us? It won't take long.</b>

251
00:18:53,579 --> 00:18:54,830
<b>She's an illegal immigrant.</b>

252
00:19:00,878 --> 00:19:01,962
<b>Why are you smiling?</b>

253
00:19:02,046 --> 00:19:04,924
<b>I know someone who looks like you,
but you're so different from him.</b>

254
00:19:05,257 --> 00:19:06,258
<b>I'm sorry about earlier.</b>

255
00:19:07,635 --> 00:19:09,845
<b>But were you always like this?</b>

256
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:13,098
<b>So prudent and serious?</b>

257
00:19:14,058 --> 00:19:15,100
<b>Hold this.</b>

258
00:19:16,185 --> 00:19:18,771
<b>I understand how you feel.
I went through that too.</b>

259
00:19:35,079 --> 00:19:37,122
<b>I thought you'd need it,
so I made it easy for you.</b>

260
00:19:37,331 --> 00:19:38,916
<b>I'm sure you won't find anything, though.</b>

261
00:19:40,793 --> 00:19:42,711
<b>You can ask your boss why.</b>

262
00:19:42,962 --> 00:19:45,422
<b>He's a science guy,
so he'd be better at explaining.</b>

263
00:19:49,468 --> 00:19:50,386
<b>Are you</b>

264
00:19:52,429 --> 00:19:53,973
<b>from a parallel universe?</b>

265
00:19:54,723 --> 00:19:56,016
<b>Where the capital is Seoul,</b>

266
00:19:56,934 --> 00:19:59,186
<b>and the country's name
is the Republic of Korea?</b>

267
00:20:00,938 --> 00:20:02,314
<b>How do you know that?</b>

268
00:20:07,027 --> 00:20:08,070
<b>Who are you?</b>

269
00:20:09,363 --> 00:20:11,240
<b>What have you done to His Majesty?</b>

270
00:20:12,616 --> 00:20:14,868
<b>Did you make that weird scar
on his shoulder too?</b>

271
00:20:15,452 --> 00:20:17,663
<b>He has a scar on his shoulder?</b>

272
00:20:20,457 --> 00:20:22,584
<b>I don't know anything about that.</b>

273
00:20:23,836 --> 00:20:25,462
<b>We're not close enough to show
each other's backs.</b>

274
00:20:26,255 --> 00:20:29,216
<b>And don't talk to me like that.</b>

275
00:20:29,299 --> 00:20:31,802
<b>You were born in 1991, right?
I'm a year older than you.</b>

276
00:20:36,432 --> 00:20:37,599
<b>Captain Jo.</b>

277
00:20:57,411 --> 00:20:59,663
<b>I said I wanted the halls empty.</b>

278
00:21:04,293 --> 00:21:05,753
<b>Your Majesty, I wanted to ask a few--</b>

279
00:21:05,836 --> 00:21:08,630
<b>I know. I know you're curious</b>

280
00:21:08,714 --> 00:21:10,966
<b>and I understand why you want
to check her fingerprints.</b>

281
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:12,676
<b>I'll send you a link.</b>

282
00:21:12,968 --> 00:21:14,595
<b>It's about quantum mechanics.</b>

283
00:21:14,678 --> 00:21:17,347
<b>Send me your questions by text
after reading it.</b>

284
00:21:17,431 --> 00:21:21,268
<b>And will you open the door now?
The food is getting cold.</b>

285
00:21:22,561 --> 00:21:23,979
<b>But Your Majesty.</b>

286
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:26,774
<b>Didn't you get any alcohol?</b>

287
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:31,070
<b>Your guest was asking for some.</b>

288
00:21:33,864 --> 00:21:34,907
<b>Yeong.</b>

289
00:21:35,032 --> 00:21:35,949
<b>Yes, Your Majesty.</b>

290
00:21:36,533 --> 00:21:40,079
<b>Will you find out where the alcohol fridge
is located in the palace?</b>

291
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,081
<b>Pardon?</b>

292
00:21:47,169 --> 00:21:48,003
<b>By the way,</b>

293
00:21:48,837 --> 00:21:50,672
<b>when do you think His Majesty saw me?</b>

294
00:21:51,799 --> 00:21:53,258
<b>I greeted him,</b>

295
00:21:54,134 --> 00:21:57,054
<b>but he said we'd met before
and that he was glad to see me.</b>

296
00:21:59,098 --> 00:22:00,432
<b>I had never met him before.</b>

297
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:06,271
<b>Was there anything notable
about the woman in there?</b>

298
00:22:06,396 --> 00:22:08,607
<b>-Except that she asked for alcohol.
-You shouldn't ask me.</b>

299
00:22:09,108 --> 00:22:11,235
<b>I'm only going to report
to Head Court Lady Noh.</b>

300
00:22:14,363 --> 00:22:15,364
<b>You're good at your job.</b>

301
00:22:15,447 --> 00:22:17,741
<b>I feel so sad about</b>

302
00:22:17,825 --> 00:22:19,326
<b>missing this great opportunity.</b>

303
00:22:20,577 --> 00:22:22,871
<b>I have to go meet Head Court Lady Noh.</b>

304
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:24,748
<b>I'll be off, then.</b>

305
00:22:37,136 --> 00:22:39,054
<b>-Did you just lock me up in here?
-I'm housing you.</b>

306
00:22:39,138 --> 00:22:40,681
<b>So be understanding.</b>

307
00:22:41,598 --> 00:22:43,600
<b>I brought you here
without saying anything.</b>

308
00:22:44,268 --> 00:22:47,271
<b>Everyone's in a panic
because this has never happened before.</b>

309
00:22:47,354 --> 00:22:48,772
<b>Why are you so calm, then?</b>

310
00:22:49,356 --> 00:22:52,651
<b>I imagined bringing you here
lots of times before.</b>

311
00:22:53,026 --> 00:22:54,153
<b>Although it wasn't like this.</b>

312
00:22:57,489 --> 00:22:59,908
<b>Did you make a contract or something?
Did you buy land?</b>

313
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:06,165
<b>I stopped myself from wiping it
on the wall because of your citizens.</b>

314
00:23:06,748 --> 00:23:08,750
<b>You should promote that employee
who was watching me.</b>

315
00:23:08,834 --> 00:23:09,877
<b>She's a real patriot.</b>

316
00:23:11,003 --> 00:23:13,213
<b>Let me borrow your phone,
and give it to me unlocked.</b>

317
00:23:13,672 --> 00:23:15,549
<b>She wouldn't lend me her phone.</b>

318
00:23:16,675 --> 00:23:17,843
<b>What are you going to look up?</b>

319
00:23:18,468 --> 00:23:20,053
<b>I'm sure you have nowhere to call.</b>

320
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,764
<b>None of your business.</b>

321
00:23:23,015 --> 00:23:23,932
<b>What's your passcode?</b>

322
00:23:24,016 --> 00:23:26,018
<b>Who would even try to look
through a King's phone?</b>

323
00:23:26,226 --> 00:23:27,060
<b>It's not locked.</b>

324
00:23:33,734 --> 00:23:34,693
<b>Pass me the snack.</b>

325
00:23:34,776 --> 00:23:36,195
<b>It's not a snack, it's dinner.</b>

326
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,489
<b>I thought you would be hungry.</b>

327
00:23:42,242 --> 00:23:43,118
<b>You try it first.</b>

328
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:47,414
<b>-What?
-I'm not joking.</b>

329
00:23:47,998 --> 00:23:49,708
<b>I'm Alice in Wonderland right now.</b>

330
00:23:49,791 --> 00:23:53,170
<b>She eats weird pills
and grows bigger and smaller and stuff.</b>

331
00:23:53,253 --> 00:23:56,173
<b>What if I eat this and die from poisoning
or natural causes and stuff?</b>

332
00:23:57,507 --> 00:23:58,592
<b>Don't worry.</b>

333
00:23:59,134 --> 00:24:01,345
<b>I keep my promises.
You'll die from a beheading.</b>

334
00:24:03,013 --> 00:24:04,264
<b>All right, then.</b>

335
00:24:04,681 --> 00:24:05,682
<b>I'll enjoy the food.</b>

336
00:24:15,317 --> 00:24:16,360
<b>You made this yourself?</b>

337
00:24:17,527 --> 00:24:19,112
<b>Yes. Is it good?</b>

338
00:24:20,072 --> 00:24:20,906
<b>No, it's bad.</b>

339
00:24:24,368 --> 00:24:27,704
<b>I haven't done this for about 25 years,</b>

340
00:24:28,288 --> 00:24:29,748
<b>but I should call my officials today.</b>

341
00:24:30,374 --> 00:24:33,001
<b>In this world,
if I say "Anyone out there?",</b>

342
00:24:33,085 --> 00:24:35,420
<b>everyone will come rushing...</b>

343
00:24:37,756 --> 00:24:38,757
<b>Oh, gosh.</b>

344
00:24:44,096 --> 00:24:45,514
<b>Were you really standing outside the door?</b>

345
00:24:45,597 --> 00:24:48,225
<b>Do you think I have
that much time on my hands?</b>

346
00:24:48,767 --> 00:24:51,311
<b>And you were here this whole time?</b>

347
00:24:51,395 --> 00:24:53,063
<b>No, I came just a minute ago.</b>

348
00:24:54,273 --> 00:24:55,482
<b>I barely sat down.</b>

349
00:24:57,818 --> 00:25:00,570
<b>I prepared a bedroom and a meal
for your guest,</b>

350
00:25:01,947 --> 00:25:05,325
<b>but since she seems to have eaten,
I will escort her to her room.</b>

351
00:25:06,576 --> 00:25:09,496
<b>It is the farthest room from your room,
Your Majesty.</b>

352
00:25:20,424 --> 00:25:22,301
<b>I'll see you tomorrow. Get some sleep.</b>

353
00:25:28,098 --> 00:25:30,225
<b>I was talking to you.</b>

354
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:32,853
<b>You should really sleep well.</b>

355
00:25:36,106 --> 00:25:39,651
<b>Is it far to the right
or to the left from my room?</b>

356
00:25:40,777 --> 00:25:42,237
<b>My goodness!</b>

357
00:25:53,373 --> 00:25:55,334
<b>Besides emergency situations,</b>

358
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:58,420
<b>outsiders hardly ever stay</b>

359
00:25:58,503 --> 00:26:00,589
<b>in the palace overnight.</b>

360
00:26:01,506 --> 00:26:06,511
<b>So you must never speak
about what happened today</b>

361
00:26:06,595 --> 00:26:08,221
<b>anywhere or to anyone.</b>

362
00:26:09,348 --> 00:26:13,894
<b>You must keep everything a secret,
such as the structure of the palace</b>

363
00:26:14,519 --> 00:26:17,314
<b>or the private conversations
you've had with the King.</b>

364
00:26:18,315 --> 00:26:19,691
<b>You don't need to worry about that.</b>

365
00:26:20,192 --> 00:26:22,069
<b>I'm a government official, too.</b>

366
00:26:22,652 --> 00:26:23,570
<b>So I've seen.</b>

367
00:26:26,031 --> 00:26:27,366
<b>Lieutenant Jeong Tae-eul.</b>

368
00:26:31,411 --> 00:26:34,289
<b>I've been meaning to ask this.</b>

369
00:26:35,290 --> 00:26:36,500
<b>How do you people</b>

370
00:26:37,167 --> 00:26:38,835
<b>know me?</b>

371
00:26:40,921 --> 00:26:42,798
<b>A lieutenant in the police force?</b>

372
00:26:44,216 --> 00:26:46,802
<b>It is very strange.</b>

373
00:26:48,053 --> 00:26:53,100
<b>His Majesty has had a strange ID card
since he was young.</b>

374
00:26:54,851 --> 00:26:59,439
<b>There was no police officer named
Jeong Tae-eul in the Kingdom of Corea,</b>

375
00:27:01,858 --> 00:27:04,778
<b>and there is no such rank
as a lieutenant in the police force here.</b>

376
00:27:05,821 --> 00:27:11,368
<b>I thought that it was a fake ID
made as a joke or for some other reason,</b>

377
00:27:13,203 --> 00:27:14,496
<b>but that nonexistent person</b>

378
00:27:14,579 --> 00:27:16,373
<b>suddenly appeared here.</b>

379
00:27:18,208 --> 00:27:19,751
<b>It's shocking.</b>

380
00:27:22,212 --> 00:27:24,339
<b>Everything is just absurd,</b>

381
00:27:25,257 --> 00:27:26,758
<b>but there is one thing I'm sure about.</b>

382
00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:31,930
<b>An existence that cannot be explained
will only bring chaos to the world,</b>

383
00:27:32,347 --> 00:27:34,224
<b>and it will only harm our King.</b>

384
00:27:35,517 --> 00:27:36,435
<b>So</b>

385
00:27:37,144 --> 00:27:38,812
<b>during your stay here,</b>

386
00:27:39,438 --> 00:27:43,233
<b>please try to avoid contact</b>

387
00:27:43,567 --> 00:27:48,029
<b>with anyone besides the King,
the Chief of the Royal Guard, and me.</b>

388
00:27:50,031 --> 00:27:53,368
<b>Furthermore,
don't get curious about this world,</b>

389
00:27:54,119 --> 00:27:55,787
<b>and don't try to stay.</b>

390
00:27:58,999 --> 00:28:00,542
<b>And when I say "this world,"</b>

391
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:03,378
<b>that includes the King.</b>

392
00:29:10,529 --> 00:29:12,155
<b>I was right.</b>

393
00:29:13,156 --> 00:29:14,282
<b>It was far to the right.</b>

394
00:29:20,455 --> 00:29:21,623
<b>I thought you'd be glad to see me.</b>

395
00:29:22,207 --> 00:29:23,416
<b>You came empty-handed?</b>

396
00:29:32,842 --> 00:29:35,929
<b>There's a bed and a sofa in here.
Why are you sitting on the floor?</b>

397
00:29:36,888 --> 00:29:39,391
<b>There's a draft in here,
especially on the left side of the bed.</b>

398
00:29:53,405 --> 00:29:54,406
<b>Why are you here?</b>

399
00:29:56,575 --> 00:29:58,535
<b>I didn't want to leave you scared
all by yourself.</b>

400
00:29:59,911 --> 00:30:01,997
<b>Trust me. I'm not a weird person here.</b>

401
00:30:03,915 --> 00:30:07,627
<b>Why did you use the window
instead of the door if you're not weird?</b>

402
00:30:09,796 --> 00:30:10,797
<b>You should know...</b>

403
00:30:11,339 --> 00:30:12,549
<b>That's the shortcut.</b>

404
00:30:13,466 --> 00:30:14,676
<b>The palace is really big.</b>

405
00:30:16,303 --> 00:30:17,887
<b>I thought you couldn't sit on the floor.</b>

406
00:30:19,514 --> 00:30:20,765
<b>It's not so bad, actually.</b>

407
00:30:22,058 --> 00:30:24,561
<b>And it feels kind of nice with the draft.</b>

408
00:30:31,735 --> 00:30:35,655
<b>When are you going to show me my ID card?</b>

409
00:30:39,659 --> 00:30:41,036
<b>-Tomorrow.
-Why tomorrow?</b>

410
00:30:41,911 --> 00:30:43,330
<b>Were you just pretending to have it?</b>

411
00:30:43,913 --> 00:30:44,831
<b>I do have it.</b>

412
00:30:46,333 --> 00:30:47,917
<b>You might try to go back to your world</b>

413
00:30:49,461 --> 00:30:50,754
<b>if I show you.</b>

414
00:30:58,178 --> 00:30:59,179
<b>What is it?</b>

415
00:31:00,597 --> 00:31:01,598
<b>What?</b>

416
00:31:11,024 --> 00:31:12,108
<i><b>The doll on my car key.</i></b>

417
00:31:13,151 --> 00:31:14,402
<b>It seems pretty cheap.</b>

418
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:26,331
<b>SHOOTING, ARCHERY</b>

419
00:31:26,414 --> 00:31:28,375
<b>You can win this
if you hit the target seven times.</b>

420
00:31:28,458 --> 00:31:30,835
<b>But if you've served in the military,</b>

421
00:31:30,919 --> 00:31:32,837
<b>it'll be a piece of cake.</b>

422
00:31:34,047 --> 00:31:35,799
<b>It's 10,000 won for 10 bullets.
How many do you want?</b>

423
00:31:35,882 --> 00:31:37,175
<b>I only need seven bullets.</b>

424
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:58,405
<i><b>You should really know,</i></b>

425
00:31:59,072 --> 00:32:01,700
<b>nothing I have is cheap.</b>

426
00:32:06,329 --> 00:32:07,455
<b>How much did you spend?</b>

427
00:32:08,039 --> 00:32:10,375
<b>Anyone who's served in the military
can do it with their eyes closed.</b>

428
00:32:10,458 --> 00:32:11,376
<b>I knew it.</b>

429
00:32:12,711 --> 00:32:14,629
<b>Everyone in your country is a swindler.</b>

430
00:32:16,172 --> 00:32:18,758
<b>Be quiet. There's someone
guarding the door outside.</b>

431
00:32:18,842 --> 00:32:22,220
<b>Are you stupid?
There are dozens of security cameras here.</b>

432
00:32:26,599 --> 00:32:28,935
<b>Is that a security camera?</b>

433
00:32:29,644 --> 00:32:30,812
<b>Wave to them.</b>

434
00:32:31,688 --> 00:32:33,314
<b>Twelve people are watching us right now.</b>

435
00:32:34,691 --> 00:32:35,775
<b>For real?</b>

436
00:32:40,238 --> 00:32:41,531
<b>You believe everything I say now.</b>

437
00:32:42,699 --> 00:32:43,658
<b>That was a lie.</b>

438
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,079
<b>Are you kidding me?</b>

439
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:51,416
<b>So</b>

440
00:32:52,208 --> 00:32:53,960
<b>is that really a security camera or not?</b>

441
00:32:54,377 --> 00:32:56,546
<b>It isn't. I was just joking.</b>

442
00:33:00,008 --> 00:33:01,092
<b>You want proof?</b>

443
00:33:10,059 --> 00:33:10,894
<b>Move.</b>

444
00:33:13,313 --> 00:33:14,355
<b>This might look romantic,</b>

445
00:33:15,356 --> 00:33:16,983
<b>but it's actually really uncomfortable.</b>

446
00:33:17,734 --> 00:33:20,195
<b>No, it's not uncomfortable at all.</b>

447
00:33:26,284 --> 00:33:29,746
<b>I'm going to ask you something,
so just answer with yes or no.</b>

448
00:33:31,372 --> 00:33:32,207
<b>Okay.</b>

449
00:33:33,041 --> 00:33:34,834
<b>You've never dated before, right?</b>

450
00:33:36,795 --> 00:33:38,046
<b>You startled me.</b>

451
00:33:39,923 --> 00:33:40,840
<b>Yes,</b>

452
00:33:41,382 --> 00:33:42,258
<b>I have.</b>

453
00:33:42,926 --> 00:33:44,385
<b>Should I guess when?</b>

454
00:33:44,969 --> 00:33:46,304
<b>Guess.</b>

455
00:33:46,387 --> 00:33:47,222
<b>Now.</b>

456
00:33:54,145 --> 00:33:55,355
<b>Should I have done this?</b>

457
00:34:19,295 --> 00:34:21,339
<b>Try guessing what I just proved.</b>

458
00:34:22,715 --> 00:34:23,800
<b>The fact that I've dated before?</b>

459
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:25,260
<b>Or</b>

460
00:34:26,678 --> 00:34:28,179
<b>that I'm dating right now?</b>

461
00:34:52,271 --> 00:34:55,816
<b>Did Squad Two find the weapon used
in their murder case?</b>

00:57:28,709 --> 00:57:29,669
<b>What is this about?</b>

767
00:57:30,336 --> 00:57:31,462
<b>Are you visiting the station?</b>

768
00:57:33,714 --> 00:57:34,799
<b>Are you a detective?</b>

769
00:57:37,843 --> 00:57:40,471
<b>No, it's nothing. I guess I was mistaken.</b>

770
00:57:41,806 --> 00:57:43,391
<b>Enjoy your meal.</b>

771
00:57:44,475 --> 00:57:45,559
<b>-All right.
-Oh, okay.</b>

772
00:57:49,522 --> 00:57:52,441
<b>You've been on the news
too often these days.</b>

773
00:57:52,733 --> 00:57:55,653
<b>Yeah, I was so shocked.
I look so good on screen.</b>

774
00:57:55,736 --> 00:57:56,570
<b>You looked so cool.</b>

775
00:57:56,654 --> 00:57:58,364
<b>What do you want to eat?
I want ox bone soup.</b>

776
00:57:58,447 --> 00:57:59,740
<b>I want ox knee soup.</b>

777
00:58:00,741 --> 00:58:04,912
<b>Hey, but how did she know
we were on our way to eat?</b>

778
00:58:12,211 --> 00:58:13,170
<b>Bye.</b>

779
00:58:18,217 --> 00:58:20,594
<b>-Let's eat ox knee soup.
-All right. There's a place I know.</b>

780
00:58:20,678 --> 00:58:24,390
<b>It's been there for 50 years, and
the bone soup tastes just like knee soup.</b>

781
00:58:24,473 --> 00:58:25,683
<b>Don't be ridiculous.</b>

782
00:58:44,827 --> 00:58:46,620
<b>If he hasn't become a detective...</b>

783
00:58:48,122 --> 00:58:48,998
<b>Right...</b>

784
00:58:49,749 --> 00:58:51,417
<b>It means his family didn't get bankrupt.</b>

785
00:58:52,752 --> 00:58:55,212
<b>The Kang Sin-jae of the Kingdom of Corea</b>

786
00:58:56,047 --> 00:58:57,048
<b>is so cool.</b>

787
00:59:00,801 --> 00:59:01,802
<b>Wow.</b>

788
01:00:19,338 --> 01:00:20,214
<b>Oh, hey.</b>

789
01:00:21,215 --> 01:00:22,550
<b>I'm running into you often lately.</b>

790
01:00:23,759 --> 01:00:24,969
<b>And you're still eating sweets.</b>

791
01:00:25,553 --> 01:00:28,514
<b>I don't eat sweets that often,
but I keep getting caught eating them.</b>

792
01:00:29,849 --> 01:00:32,351
<b>-What are you doing in this neighborhood?
-I live around here.</b>

793
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:36,605
<b>Well, I used to live around here.</b>

794
01:00:38,315 --> 01:00:39,692
<b>I guess you're having a gathering today.</b>

795
01:00:41,694 --> 01:00:43,070
<b>I'm just going to have some drinks.</b>

796
01:00:43,487 --> 01:00:45,447
<b>This won't be enough
if I start drinking in the daytime.</b>

797
01:00:45,865 --> 01:00:47,241
<b>Do you want one?</b>

798
01:00:56,750 --> 01:00:59,170
<b>Is it okay for a psychiatrist
to be an alcoholic?</b>

799
01:01:01,088 --> 01:01:03,257
<b>I'm not that dependent.
I have a high alcohol tolerance.</b>

800
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:06,552
<b>But are sweets really effective?</b>

801
01:01:09,013 --> 01:01:11,098
<b>It's just nice
because it's sweet and melts fast.</b>

802
01:01:11,182 --> 01:01:13,642
<b>Isn't it better for it to melt
slowly if it's sweet?</b>

803
01:01:13,893 --> 01:01:15,019
<b>It's going to melt anyway.</b>

804
01:01:18,606 --> 01:01:20,149
<b>By the way, what's your job?</b>

805
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:24,653
<b>I thought I'd ask you at the next session,
but you didn't come.</b>

806
01:01:26,739 --> 01:01:28,741
<b>-I'm a detective.
-Really?</b>

807
01:01:29,575 --> 01:01:31,327
<b>I guessed totally wrong.</b>

808
01:01:32,453 --> 01:01:35,039
<b>-I thought you were a gangster.
-What kind of psychiatrist...</b>

809
01:01:36,790 --> 01:01:38,125
<b>That's why the meds didn't work.</b>

810
01:01:38,209 --> 01:01:40,044
<b>You probably didn't even take them.</b>

811
01:01:42,213 --> 01:01:44,131
<b>When did you move away
from this neighborhood?</b>

812
01:01:44,548 --> 01:01:47,384
<b>I've always lived here,
so we could've run into each other...</b>

813
01:01:51,388 --> 01:01:55,142
<b>Yes. I told you that my family
got bankrupt when I was little.</b>

814
01:01:56,810 --> 01:01:58,395
<b>We moved out when I was in middle school.</b>

815
01:02:00,773 --> 01:02:02,399
<b>The house prices here
went up a lot, right?</b>

816
01:02:02,942 --> 01:02:05,819
<b>I visit here sometimes,
but I feel so bitter.</b>

817
01:02:07,863 --> 01:02:10,824
<b>What do you think makes you
keep returning to this place?</b>

818
01:02:12,868 --> 01:02:15,120
<b>Do you still have
the same recurring nightmares?</b>

819
01:02:18,624 --> 01:02:20,292
<b>Don't start a session
so suddenly like this.</b>

820
01:02:21,168 --> 01:02:22,878
<b>Especially when you're drinking.</b>

821
01:02:23,295 --> 01:02:24,922
<b>You're treating me like some quack.</b>

822
01:02:27,591 --> 01:02:29,093
<b>All right, let's just drink then.</b>

823
01:02:44,817 --> 01:02:47,778
<b>I'M BORED, LET'S PLAY POOL</b>

824
01:02:50,155 --> 01:02:51,198
<i><b>Jeong who?</i></b>

825
01:02:51,699 --> 01:02:52,658
<b>SUIM ORIENTAL CLINIC</b>

826
01:02:52,741 --> 01:02:54,326
<b>Jeong Do-in.</b>

827
01:02:54,827 --> 01:02:58,122
<b>He's a Taekwondo instructor
at a Taekwondo center.</b>

828
01:02:58,747 --> 01:03:00,207
<b>I don't know anyone by that name.</b>

829
01:03:03,085 --> 01:03:04,420
<b>Then...</b>

830
01:03:07,756 --> 01:03:11,969
<b>How about a woman named Ahn Bong-hui?</b>

831
01:03:13,095 --> 01:03:14,054
<b>Do you know her?</b>

832
01:03:14,138 --> 01:03:16,140
<b>Her face looks really similar to mine.</b>

833
01:03:16,348 --> 01:03:18,684
<b>Have you ever seen her?</b>

834
01:03:19,560 --> 01:03:20,769
<b>Ahn Bong-hui?</b>

835
01:03:21,770 --> 01:03:22,771
<b>No, I haven't.</b>

836
01:03:23,355 --> 01:03:25,316
<b>We've lived here for 30 years.</b>

837
01:03:25,941 --> 01:03:28,068
<b>Why? Did they say they live here?</b>

838
01:03:29,320 --> 01:03:31,071
<b>No, never mind. Thank you.</b>

839
01:03:44,084 --> 01:03:45,377
<b>It's 41,800 won.</b>

840
01:03:45,502 --> 01:03:46,545
<b>Oh, right. One second.</b>

841
01:03:56,764 --> 01:03:59,141
<b>I'm sorry, but how much
is a standing ticket?</b>

842
01:04:00,267 --> 01:04:01,643
<b>It's 34,800 won.</b>

843
01:04:06,148 --> 01:04:09,109
<b>I rode a taxi
without thinking about the ticket.</b>

844
01:04:10,110 --> 01:04:13,697
<b>I'm sorry,
but is there a bus terminal in Gangnam?</b>

845
01:04:14,323 --> 01:04:15,324
<b>There's one in Songpa-gu.</b>

846
01:04:16,075 --> 01:04:18,994
<b>But even if you go now,
you'd miss the last bus.</b>

847
01:04:19,495 --> 01:04:20,746
<b>Don't you have a card?</b>

848
01:04:26,418 --> 01:04:29,505
<b>I'm telling you, it's not a prank call!</b>

849
01:04:29,588 --> 01:04:31,006
<b>I really know Lee Gon...</b>

850
01:04:33,550 --> 01:04:35,844
<b>I mean, the King... I know the King.</b>

851
01:04:36,345 --> 01:04:38,389
<b>Okay? I'm an acquaintance.</b>

852
01:04:38,722 --> 01:04:39,598
<b>I...</b>

853
01:04:44,311 --> 01:04:45,854
<b>I'm really serious.</b>

854
01:04:46,980 --> 01:04:49,024
<b>I just need to talk to him for one minute.</b>

855
01:04:52,736 --> 01:04:56,115
<b>I'm short of 2,600 won,</b>

856
01:04:56,949 --> 01:04:59,576
<b>so I can't return to Busan right now.</b>

857
01:05:04,915 --> 01:05:05,874
<b>Just ten seconds.</b>

858
01:05:05,958 --> 01:05:08,502
<b>Please, just ten seconds. I...</b>

859
01:05:16,051 --> 01:05:16,927
<b>Who</b>

860
01:05:18,512 --> 01:05:20,222
<b>did you say it was just now?</b>

861
01:05:21,515 --> 01:05:22,474
<b>Well, Your Majesty,</b>

862

<b>some woman called

<b>seventeen times, asking for you.</b>

864
01:05:28,605 --> 01:05:30,482
<b>-The security team was checking--
-No,</b>

865
01:05:31,692 --> 01:05:33,360
<b>I mean the name of the caller.</b>

866
01:05:34,695 --> 01:05:36,947
<b>Well, she said she was Princess Diana.</b>

867
01:05:37,406 --> 01:05:39,992
<b>They tracked her location just in case,
and she's at Seoul Station.</b>

868
01:05:42,536 --> 01:05:43,454
<b>Turn the helicopter.</b>

869
01:05:44,371 --> 01:05:45,497
<b>We're going to Seoul.</b>

870
01:05:46,415 --> 01:05:47,499
<b>Pardon?</b>

871
01:05:47,583 --> 01:05:50,377
<b>Check Captain Jo's location right now.</b>

872
01:05:50,461 --> 01:05:51,378
<b>Yes, Your Majesty.</b>

873
01:06:13,692 --> 01:06:14,610
<b>Oh, my gosh.</b>

874
01:06:17,321 --> 01:06:18,322
<b>What are you doing here?</b>

875
01:06:18,405 --> 01:06:19,948
<b>I received orders from the King.</b>

876
01:06:20,949 --> 01:06:22,993
<b>He said you must be kept alive
until your beheading.</b>

877
01:06:27,122 --> 01:06:29,666
<b>But do you even really behead people here?</b>

878
01:06:30,292 --> 01:06:33,253
<b>It hasn't happened since 1920, but...</b>

879
01:06:35,214 --> 01:06:37,007
<b>it seems like it could happen again soon.</b>

880
01:06:37,090 --> 01:06:38,342
<b>My gosh.</b>

881
01:06:40,636 --> 01:06:41,887
<b>Who are you, really?</b>

882
01:06:42,429 --> 01:06:43,597
<b>Are you really a detective?</b>

883
01:06:44,681 --> 01:06:46,600
<b>Why did you go
to the police station earlier?</b>

884
01:06:48,852 --> 01:06:50,062
<b>Were you following me?</b>

885
01:06:51,813 --> 01:06:52,648
<b>Follow me.</b>

886
01:07:43,865 --> 01:07:44,866
<b>I heard you were looking for me.</b>

887
01:07:46,076 --> 01:07:46,952
<b>Yes.</b>

888
01:07:47,035 --> 01:07:48,161
<b>Seventeen times.</b>

889
01:07:49,079 --> 01:07:49,997
<b>Yes.</b>

890
01:07:50,080 --> 01:07:51,915
<b>I thought you were going to stay in Busan.</b>

891
01:07:52,457 --> 01:07:53,917
<b>Why did you come so far?</b>

892
01:07:55,836 --> 01:07:57,546
<b>Did you get to find Ahn Bong-hui?</b>

893
01:07:57,838 --> 01:07:58,839
<b>How did you know?</b>

894
01:08:01,967 --> 01:08:04,094
<b>Since when were you following me?</b>

895
01:08:04,261 --> 01:08:06,471
<b>You should have lent me money
if you were there all along.</b>

896
01:08:08,098 --> 01:08:09,016
<b>Who is she?</b>

897
01:08:09,641 --> 01:08:12,269
<b>Who are you looking for in this world?</b>

898
01:08:16,857 --> 01:08:17,983
<b>My mom.</b>

899
01:08:20,110 --> 01:08:21,653
<b>If this is a parallel world...</b>

900
01:08:22,404 --> 01:08:25,365
<b>And since Na-ri and Eun-sup are both here,</b>

901
01:08:26,992 --> 01:08:29,077
<b>although I might not exist...</b>

902
01:08:31,330 --> 01:08:32,914
<b>my mother could still be alive.</b>

903
01:08:34,541 --> 01:08:36,126
<b>I know she is someone else,</b>

904
01:08:37,836 --> 01:08:39,671
<b>but I didn't want her to be sick
in this world.</b>

905
01:08:40,756 --> 01:08:43,967
<b>I only have memories of her
from when I was five.</b>

906
01:08:46,386 --> 01:08:48,096
<b>So I just wanted to watch her from afar.</b>

907
01:08:48,805 --> 01:08:50,182
<b>That's why I came here.</b>

908
01:08:52,392 --> 01:08:53,810
<b>You should have told me.</b>

909
01:08:54,728 --> 01:08:55,937
<b>I was just curious.</b>

910
01:08:56,980 --> 01:08:58,106
<b>But she wasn't there.</b>

911
01:08:59,733 --> 01:09:00,609
<b>Anyway...</b>

912
01:09:00,859 --> 01:09:03,945
<b>I had fun today because of you.</b>

913
01:09:04,529 --> 01:09:05,947
<b>Is that why you searched for KTX?</b>

914
01:09:06,573 --> 01:09:08,033
<b>I was wondering what KTX is.</b>

915
01:09:09,409 --> 01:09:10,827
<b>Search?</b>

916
01:09:13,330 --> 01:09:14,456
<b>He didn't tell me that.</b>

917
01:09:15,123 --> 01:09:16,792
<b>The auto-save function told me.</b>

918
01:09:17,834 --> 01:09:19,836
<b>You were curious about a lot of things.</b>

919
01:09:20,587 --> 01:09:22,631
<b>Why were you curious about
Lee Gon's ex-girlfriend?</b>

920
01:09:23,298 --> 01:09:24,716
<b>Didn't you think
that I never had a girlfriend?</b>

921
01:09:26,927 --> 01:09:29,304
<b>Why would you read that?</b>

922
01:09:30,013 --> 01:09:30,889
<b>That's cheating.</b>

923
01:09:33,058 --> 01:09:34,726
<b>Your Majesty, Prime Minister Koo is--</b>

924
01:09:34,810 --> 01:09:37,354
<b>Right. You looked up
Prime Minister Koo as well.</b>

925
01:09:37,437 --> 01:09:38,980
<b>That was because...</b>

926
01:09:39,690 --> 01:09:43,485
<b>Because I heard she was
the youngest female Prime Minister.</b>

927
01:09:43,568 --> 01:09:46,029
<b>I only looked up her name
because I was amazed by that.</b>

928
01:09:47,531 --> 01:09:48,949
<b>Why? Do you feel guilty?</b>

929
01:09:49,032 --> 01:09:50,534
<b>I meet her every Friday.</b>

930
01:09:52,119 --> 01:09:53,036
<b>Is she IU?</b>

931
01:10:00,627 --> 01:10:02,003
<b>Yes, it's Prime Minister Koo.</b>

932
01:10:02,629 --> 01:10:06,049
<b>She probably got a report
that your helicopter landed in Seoul.</b>

933
01:10:36,079 --> 01:10:38,623
<b>I'm seeing you at an unexpected hour,
in an unexpected place,</b>

934
01:10:40,041 --> 01:10:41,626
<b>with an unexpected person, Your Majesty.</b>

935
01:10:42,461 --> 01:10:43,336
<b>You're right.</b>

936
01:10:43,837 --> 01:10:45,839
<b>And you've put me in an awkward situation.</b>

937
01:10:48,008 --> 01:10:48,842
<b>Nice to meet you.</b>

938
01:10:50,135 --> 01:10:52,304
<b>I'm Koo Seo-ryeong,
Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Corea.</b>
