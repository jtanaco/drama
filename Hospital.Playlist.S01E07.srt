1
00:00:18,468 --> 00:00:20,800
<b>How's the liver? Are you heading here now?</b>

2
00:00:20,804 --> 00:00:22,725
<i><b>We have a problem, Professor Ahn.</i></b>

3
00:00:23,073 --> 00:00:26,425
<b>- What's wrong? - <i>The donor's liver is too thick.</i></b>

4
00:00:27,344 --> 00:00:30,905
<i><b>It looks like it weighs over 500g. And her AP must be as thick as 8cm.</i></b>

5
00:00:31,515 --> 00:00:32,935
<i><b>What should we do?</i></b>

6
00:00:48,832 --> 00:00:51,225
<i><b>This liver seems too big for Ji- a. It won't work.</i></b>

7
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:54,525
<i><b>I think you should give up.</i></b>

8
00:00:54,538 --> 00:00:56,965
<b>No, we'll proceed as planned.</b>

9
00:00:58,341 --> 00:00:59,825
<b>I'm going to do this.</b>

10
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:10,880
<b>Hello.</b>

11
00:01:10,887 --> 00:01:13,490
<b>- You're still here? - Yes.</b>

12
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:16,145
<b>Did the painter Mr. Jang Hong- do leave for the day?</b>

13
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:18,690
<b>Yes, Mr. Jang was...</b>

14
00:01:18,695 --> 00:01:21,130
<b>I mean, he was here, but he left just now.</b>

15
00:01:21,131 --> 00:01:23,700
<b>All right. You should get going too.</b>

16
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:24,955
<b>Okay.</b>

17
00:01:28,305 --> 00:01:29,925
<b>Want to see a liver transplant?</b>

18
00:01:31,875 --> 00:01:33,125
<b>Yes.</b>

19
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:36,765
<b>Thank you.</b>

20
00:01:47,991 --> 00:01:50,990
<i><b>For a baby to get a liver transplant, the size is the most important factor.</i></b>

21
00:01:50,994 --> 00:01:54,160
<i><b>If it's too big, the results will be fatally affected.</i></b>

22
00:01:54,164 --> 00:01:57,400
<b>For a baby, we'd usually cut a brain- dead donor's liver in half,</b>

23
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,930
<b>but this donor's liver is much bigger than we expected.</b>

24
00:01:59,936 --> 00:02:03,600
<b>Even if we cut it in half, it'll still be too big for the baby.</b>

25
00:02:03,607 --> 00:02:05,400
<b>Ji- a is only six months old.</b>

26
00:02:05,408 --> 00:02:08,710
<b>So, Ji- a can't get the surgery? Will she have to wait for another liver?</b>

27
00:02:08,712 --> 00:02:10,010
<b>She doesn't have a "next time."</b>

28
00:02:10,013 --> 00:02:13,080
<b>Her liver can't release the bile, so hepatocirrhosis is worsening rapidly.</b>

29
00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:15,180
<b>She vomited blood and had blood in her excrement.</b>

30
00:02:15,185 --> 00:02:16,720
<b>She won't last more than a week.</b>

31
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,505
<b>- Then what do we do? - What?</b>

32
00:02:19,923 --> 00:02:21,475
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

33
00:02:21,791 --> 00:02:23,520
<b>Then what do we do, Professor?</b>

34
00:02:23,527 --> 00:02:27,230
<b>She can't get the surgery and won't live if we don't do anything.</b>

35
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:29,455
<b>- What do we do? - We'll perform the surgery.</b>

36
00:02:29,533 --> 00:02:31,460
<b>But you said even the half- cut liver is too big.</b>

37
00:02:31,468 --> 00:02:33,385
<b>- We can cut it again. - What?</b>

38
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:35,295
<b>What? What's wrong?</b>

39
00:02:36,106 --> 00:02:37,365
<b>I'm really sorry.</b>

40
00:02:38,775 --> 00:02:41,640
<b>Did you say we can cut the liver again?</b>

41
00:02:41,645 --> 00:02:42,995
<b>Yes.</b>

42
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:48,035
<b>We'll cut the half- cut liver in half again.</b>

43
00:02:49,052 --> 00:02:52,475
<b>It happens occasionally. Of course, the surgery will be very difficult.</b>

44
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:55,120
<b>Still, we have to do it.</b>

45
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:57,245
<b>It won't be easy,</b>

46
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:01,385
<b>but this is the last and only way to save the baby.</b>

47
00:03:37,767 --> 00:03:40,285
<b>- Ji- a. - Please, God...</b>

48
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:00,615
<b>Here.</b>

49
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:08,490
<b>- Three, three, three. - Three, three, three.</b>

50
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:10,200
<b>- Liver coming out. - One.</b>

51
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,585
<b>- Gosh, it must have been hard for her. - Two.</b>

52
00:04:12,802 --> 00:04:15,200
<b>- Three, four. - I'm amazed she held out with that liver.</b>

53
00:04:15,205 --> 00:04:17,670
<b>- Five, six. - Ji- a is really amazing.</b>

54
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:19,925
<b>- Seven, eight. - Seven, eight.</b>

55
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:22,435
<b>- Nine. - Nine, ten.</b>

56
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:31,975
<b>The liver is here.</b>

57
00:04:36,459 --> 00:04:39,345
<b>Thank you. Thanks for your help, Dr. Jang.</b>

58
00:04:40,397 --> 00:04:43,085
<b>You said you were by the traffic light across the street.</b>

59
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:44,760
<b>You got here so fast.</b>

60
00:04:44,768 --> 00:04:47,455
<b>- Did you run? - Thankfully, the traffic wasn't so bad.</b>

61
00:04:47,904 --> 00:04:51,025
<b>But the elevator in this building is broken,</b>

62
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:52,865
<b>so I ran up here.</b>

63
00:04:53,076 --> 00:04:55,435
<b>I mean, I didn't run.</b>

64
00:04:56,413 --> 00:04:57,665
<b>I quickly...</b>

65
00:04:57,914 --> 00:05:01,205
<b>I walked quickly. Just walked.</b>

66
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:04,305
<b>I was being careful to deliver this safe and sound.</b>

67
00:05:10,093 --> 00:05:11,645
<b>My gosh, Gyeo- ul.</b>

68
00:05:11,861 --> 00:05:13,345
<b>Great job.</b>

69
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:29,835
<b>It looks like we're done, Professor.</b>

70
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,565
<b>Yes, thanks for all your help.</b>

71
00:05:59,409 --> 00:06:01,565
<b>- We're ready, Professor. - Okay.</b>

72
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:10,235
<b>Would you like to try the next External Ventricular Drainage?</b>

73
00:06:10,387 --> 00:06:11,845
<b>What?</b>

74
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:15,115
<b>You're in your third year, so it's about time.</b>

75
00:06:15,358 --> 00:06:17,015
<b>Get ready.</b>

76
00:06:19,028 --> 00:06:20,445
<b>Thank you.</b>

77
00:06:26,703 --> 00:06:28,600
<b>The liver has been cut, so it's bleeding a lot.</b>

78
00:06:28,605 --> 00:06:29,895
<b>Forceps. Quick.</b>

79
00:06:35,712 --> 00:06:38,440
<b>This will take a while. Ik- jun.</b>

80
00:06:38,448 --> 00:06:40,775
<b>Yes, I'll let her parents know.</b>

81
00:06:44,287 --> 00:06:46,045
<b>There's a lot of bleeding, Doctor.</b>

82
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:49,575
<b>Yes, she's still okay though.</b>

83
00:06:51,127 --> 00:06:53,955
<b>Focus. You have to do a thorough job with the suction.</b>

84
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:57,485
<b>- I can't see. - Okay.</b>

85
00:06:58,535 --> 00:06:59,825
<b>Pass me the gauze.</b>

86
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:18,105
<b>Doctor.</b>

87
00:07:18,588 --> 00:07:20,220
<b>Is Ji- a well now?</b>

88
00:07:20,223 --> 00:07:22,475
<b>Did the surgery go well, Doctor?</b>

89
00:07:24,327 --> 00:07:25,815
<b>Yes.</b>

90
00:07:25,995 --> 00:07:27,485
<b>It went well.</b>

91
00:07:33,269 --> 00:07:37,425
<b>Why are you crying? It went very well. Ji- a is such a strong girl.</b>

92
00:07:39,008 --> 00:07:42,465
<b>Please don't cry. People will think that the surgery didn't go well.</b>

93
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:44,535
<b>Thank you.</b>

94
00:07:45,448 --> 00:07:47,205
<b>Thank you, Doctor.</b>

95
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:49,880
<b>Thank you so much for everything. We'll never forget this.</b>

96
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:53,120
<b>There was more bleeding than we had expected, so it wasn't easy.</b>

97
00:07:53,122 --> 00:07:54,950
<b>But we managed to get it under control.</b>

98
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:58,615
<b>She's stable now, and we'll move her to the ICU shortly.</b>

99
00:07:59,195 --> 00:08:00,990
<b>The transplant went well,</b>

100
00:08:00,997 --> 00:08:03,555
<b>so she'll be fine as long as the liver works well.</b>

101
00:08:03,633 --> 00:08:06,930
<b>The surgery went successfully, so Ji- a will recover soon.</b>

102
00:08:06,936 --> 00:08:09,155
<b>- Thank you. - This must've been so hard for you.</b>

103
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:11,140
<b>You held out very well.</b>

104
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:14,295
<b>I don't know how I can express my gratitude.</b>

105
00:08:15,612 --> 00:08:17,405
<b>Thank you so much.</b>

106
00:08:18,214 --> 00:08:23,335
<b>Ji- a could live because she was lucky enough to find a brain- dead donor.</b>

107
00:08:23,386 --> 00:08:24,980
<b>This is truly a miracle.</b>

108
00:08:24,988 --> 00:08:28,845
<b>And we were very lucky to find a young donor.</b>

109
00:08:28,992 --> 00:08:30,945
<b>We owe it all to you, Doctor.</b>

110
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,915
<b>Thank you so much, Doctor.</b>

111
00:08:34,397 --> 00:08:35,855
<b>Thank you.</b>

112
00:08:37,066 --> 00:08:39,325
<b>All I did was perform the surgery.</b>

113
00:08:41,037 --> 00:08:42,355
<b>Pardon?</b>

114
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:47,535
<b>You should thank that person instead.</b>

115
00:08:49,479 --> 00:08:51,035
<b>- Who? - Who?</b>

116
00:08:52,682 --> 00:08:55,335
<b>Age 22, female.</b>

117
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:57,405
<b>Tall and slim.</b>

118
00:08:58,321 --> 00:08:59,745
<b>A traffic accident victim.</b>

119
00:09:04,694 --> 00:09:06,215
<b>I'm talking about the donor.</b>

120
00:09:06,596 --> 00:09:08,415
<b>The person who gave Ji- a the liver.</b>

121
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:11,755
<b>I can't give you</b>

122
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:15,095
<b>more information about the donor as it's against our rules,</b>

123
00:09:15,705 --> 00:09:18,695
<b>but Ji- a could live thanks to her.</b>

124
00:09:20,843 --> 00:09:23,135
<b>I'm so ashamed, Doctor.</b>

125
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:28,650
<b>I'll thank her for the rest of my life.</b>

126
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:31,775
<b>I was only thinking about my baby.</b>

127
00:09:32,221 --> 00:09:34,945
<b>- I'm so sorry. - We're sorry.</b>

128
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:38,215
<b>No, don't be sorry. I fully understand.</b>

129
00:09:38,895 --> 00:09:42,555
<b>But every year, on Ji- a's birthday,</b>

130
00:09:42,966 --> 00:09:44,625
<b>please thank her</b>

131
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:47,285
<b>with all your heart.</b>

132
00:09:48,371 --> 00:09:50,925
<b>- We will. - Yes, thank you.</b>

133
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:53,065
<b>Thank you.</b>

134
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:56,665
<b>Then I'll see you in the PICU later.</b>

135
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,335
<b>Okay.</b>

136
00:09:59,749 --> 00:10:01,275
<b>Thank you.</b>

137
00:10:23,239 --> 00:10:26,170
<b>Yes. Can you send this to me with the image?</b>

138
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:28,535
<b>Yes, thank you. Will do.</b>

139
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:32,280
<b>- Still, I'm worried. - Don't be.</b>

140
00:10:32,281 --> 00:10:35,305
<b>The contractions are under control, and the baby is doing well too.</b>

141
00:10:35,451 --> 00:10:38,580
<b>- She'll be fine. - Do you have to keep using the drugs?</b>

142
00:10:38,588 --> 00:10:42,345
<b>As I explained before, those drugs are completely fine.</b>

143
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:45,290
<b>I'll go through them again with you.</b>

144
00:10:45,294 --> 00:10:46,460
<b>Just a moment, please.</b>

145
00:10:46,462 --> 00:10:49,130
<b>That patient, Park Mi- jeong. What was her cervical length again?</b>

146
00:10:49,132 --> 00:10:50,855
<b>- Hold on. - It was 1.5cm.</b>

147
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,555
<b>I see, 1.5cm.</b>

148
00:10:52,969 --> 00:10:55,270
<b>- Dr. Chu. - Yes, Professor.</b>

149
00:10:55,271 --> 00:10:58,240
<b>The C- section patient bled a lot because her contractions weren't good.</b>

150
00:10:58,241 --> 00:11:00,540
<b>Check the pad and keep an eye on her contractions.</b>

151
00:11:00,543 --> 00:11:01,995
<b>Yes, sir.</b>

152
00:11:03,112 --> 00:11:07,805
<b>Doctor, my wife says that she's in a lot of pain. What should I do?</b>

153
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:11,420
<b>I checked her five minutes ago but didn't notice any changes with her cervix.</b>

154
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:14,150
<b>I'll check in a bit and give her an analgesic if needed.</b>

155
00:11:14,157 --> 00:11:16,620
<b>Can you please check now?</b>

156
00:11:16,626 --> 00:11:17,915
<b>Sure.</b>

157
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:19,390
<b>- Dr. Chu. - Yes?</b>

158
00:11:19,395 --> 00:11:21,760
<b>We're giving Sin Hyo- jeong ritodrine at 12gtt per minute,</b>

159
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:23,290
<b>but she has tachycardia.</b>

160
00:11:23,299 --> 00:11:26,330
<b>Oh, let's bring it down to 8gtt. And check her vitals in an hour.</b>

161
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:27,595
<b>Okay.</b>

162
00:11:28,237 --> 00:11:29,570
<b>We'll see how the baby is doing</b>

163
00:11:29,572 --> 00:11:32,825
<b>and keep the baby in the womb for longer if needed.</b>

164
00:11:33,309 --> 00:11:37,680
<b>Is there a chance that the baby will be weak compared to other babies</b>

165
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,480
<b>or can't live for long?</b>

166
00:11:40,483 --> 00:11:42,450
<b>No, that won't happen.</b>

167
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:46,180
<b>My mom also had a very hard time when she had me.</b>

168
00:11:46,189 --> 00:11:49,245
<b>- Really? - In my case...</b>

169
00:11:49,425 --> 00:11:52,960
<b>My mom is diabetic, and she got pregnant unexpectedly.</b>

170
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:54,455
<b>She's diabetic?</b>

171
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:57,500
<b>Patient Seo Jeong- won's episiotomy site looks pretty good, doesn't it?</b>

172
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:01,300
<b>Yes, I checked in the morning. She doesn't have a hematoma. All good.</b>

173
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:03,470
<b>Dr. Chu, can you have a look at this NST?</b>

174
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:05,625
<b>Jeong Min- gyeong is exhibiting decelerations.</b>

175
00:12:06,008 --> 00:12:08,040
<b>Let's hydrate her.</b>

176
00:12:08,044 --> 00:12:10,640
<b>Give her 3L of oxygen via nasal prong in the lateral position.</b>

177
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:11,905
<b>Okay.</b>

178
00:12:12,381 --> 00:12:14,810
<b>- Doctor. - My sister's baby was born prematurely,</b>

179
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:17,705
<b>but she's so optimistic and easygoing though.</b>

180
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:21,250
<b>I was worried about her even though I'm an ob- gyn,</b>

181
00:12:21,257 --> 00:12:23,390
<b>but she said she was happy to meet her baby early.</b>

182
00:12:23,392 --> 00:12:26,215
<b>- My gosh, really? - Yes.</b>

183
00:12:26,662 --> 00:12:28,190
<b>- Doctor. - Yes?</b>

184
00:12:28,197 --> 00:12:31,285
<b>I'm really hungry.</b>

185
00:12:31,367 --> 00:12:33,155
<b>Can I eat something?</b>

186
00:12:33,202 --> 00:12:36,170
<b>Let's check fetal movements. Hold on. I'll be with you in a minute.</b>

187
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:40,095
<b>She'll have a healthy baby, and the baby will stay healthy.</b>

188
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:43,240
<b>My sister's baby is already two years old. Do you want to see photos?</b>

189
00:12:43,246 --> 00:12:44,735
<b>Yes, I'd love to.</b>

190
00:12:44,747 --> 00:12:47,710
<b>- Dr. Myeong. - Yes?</b>

191
00:12:47,717 --> 00:12:50,080
<b>We need to check Sin Ha- yun's fetal movements,</b>

192
00:12:50,086 --> 00:12:53,180
<b>and we have to check Jeong Min- gyeong for decelerations.</b>

193
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:54,820
<b>Also, we have two C- sections scheduled,</b>

194
00:12:54,824 --> 00:12:57,475
<b>so we have to get ready. We have a lot to do.</b>

195
00:12:57,693 --> 00:12:59,945
<b>Okay, got it.</b>

196
00:13:06,569 --> 00:13:11,165
<b>Doctor, you're very straightforward.</b>

197
00:13:12,074 --> 00:13:13,325
<b>Have a good day.</b>

198
00:13:14,477 --> 00:13:15,795
<b>You too.</b>

199
00:13:18,114 --> 00:13:21,780
<b>Well... I'll go check the C- section patient's pad.</b>

200
00:13:21,784 --> 00:13:23,175
<b>Okay.</b>

201
00:13:26,522 --> 00:13:30,515
<b>Oh, boy. A showdown between the bear and the fox.</b>

202
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,945
<b>- Who's the fox? - Isn't it obvious?</b>

203
00:13:37,466 --> 00:13:39,225
<b>RESTRICTED AREA</b>

204
00:13:40,436 --> 00:13:44,425
<b>Professor, Jeong Min- gyeong is exhibiting decelerations. I'll go check.</b>

205
00:13:45,274 --> 00:13:47,795
<b>Give her 3L of oxygen via nasal prong, right?</b>

206
00:13:48,578 --> 00:13:49,865
<b>Yes.</b>

207
00:13:50,646 --> 00:13:51,905
<b>Okay.</b>

208
00:13:56,485 --> 00:13:57,880
<b>What's taking him so long?</b>

209
00:13:57,887 --> 00:14:00,220
<b>I should've offered to pick it up.</b>

210
00:14:00,223 --> 00:14:01,750
<b>It's his minor personal satisfaction.</b>

211
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:04,045
<b>He's probably chatting with the delivery guy.</b>

212
00:14:07,129 --> 00:14:10,355
<b>Couldn't you have hurried? We're dying of hunger here.</b>

213
00:14:10,499 --> 00:14:14,525
<b>How can you talk about death so easily when you're a doctor?</b>

214
00:14:15,171 --> 00:14:18,440
<b>Hong- do and Yun- bok, eat as much as you want.</b>

215
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:20,640
<b>Eat up and join our department later on.</b>

216
00:14:20,643 --> 00:14:22,070
<b>- Okay. - Okay.</b>

217
00:14:22,078 --> 00:14:24,540
<b>Here. If you don't, that's a eat and run.</b>

218
00:14:24,547 --> 00:14:26,205
<b>- Okay. - Okay.</b>

219
00:14:26,315 --> 00:14:29,150
<b>Can I have Double Bacon? It's my favorite sandwich.</b>

220
00:14:29,151 --> 00:14:31,075
<b>My gosh, of course.</b>

221
00:14:31,687 --> 00:14:34,375
<b>- You can have two. - Great, I will.</b>

222
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,875
<b>We'll still have leftovers.</b>

223
00:14:37,059 --> 00:14:38,715
<b>So I called someone to join us.</b>

224
00:14:43,266 --> 00:14:46,025
<b>Oh, Jeong- won is- -</b>

225
00:14:47,837 --> 00:14:50,255
<b>- Sandwiches? Nice. - What the...</b>

226
00:14:50,473 --> 00:14:51,970
<b>Well, he's a rain check.</b>

227
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:55,265
<b>You should have let me finish my sentence. Goodness.</b>

228
00:14:56,612 --> 00:14:58,035
<b>Hello.</b>

229
00:14:58,114 --> 00:14:59,140
<b>- Hello. - Hello.</b>

230
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:00,805
<b>Sit down, guys.</b>

231
00:15:02,652 --> 00:15:05,680
<b>- But why am I a rain check? - Don't ask. You don't need to know.</b>

232
00:15:05,688 --> 00:15:08,475
<b>Hurry and eat, or Gyeo- ul will eat everything. Here.</b>

233
00:15:10,693 --> 00:15:12,545
<b>Oh. It's been a while, guys.</b>

234
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:15,030
<b>Gyeon- u and Jik- nyeo, right?</b>

235
00:15:15,031 --> 00:15:18,730
<b>You called us like that last time, and I told you our names.</b>

236
00:15:18,734 --> 00:15:21,055
<b>Right, they were some painters' names.</b>

237
00:15:22,038 --> 00:15:23,325
<b>Ma- ne and Mo- ne?</b>

238
00:15:24,373 --> 00:15:26,040
<b>We're Hong- do and Yun- bok.</b>

239
00:15:26,042 --> 00:15:29,870
<b>Right. Gosh, I'm really sorry. We even did the Wakanda gesture together.</b>

240
00:15:29,879 --> 00:15:31,440
<b>- Sorry, guys. - It's okay.</b>

241
00:15:31,447 --> 00:15:34,005
<b>And Ma- ne and Mo- ne are our cousins.</b>

242
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:36,810
<b>What? Seriously?</b>

243
00:15:36,819 --> 00:15:38,105
<b>Yes.</b>

244
00:15:40,289 --> 00:15:42,975
<b>Don't tell me they're twins.</b>

245
00:15:43,259 --> 00:15:44,320
<b>They are.</b>

246
00:15:44,327 --> 00:15:46,345
<b>- Identical twins? - Identical twins.</b>

247
00:15:46,429 --> 00:15:48,155
<b>- Five years old? - Five years old.</b>

248
00:15:49,532 --> 00:15:51,525
<b>Why are you saying the exact same things?</b>

249
00:16:00,676 --> 00:16:02,095
<b>Dr. Bong.</b>

250
00:16:03,446 --> 00:16:06,080
<b>- Here, have some water. - You're having a late lunch.</b>

251
00:16:06,082 --> 00:16:07,605
<b>I brought you some napkins.</b>

252
00:16:07,817 --> 00:16:12,505
<b>Oh, I had an emergency patient. How did you guys all become friends?</b>

253
00:16:12,688 --> 00:16:15,120
<b>We're both chief residents, and I've known him for a while.</b>

254
00:16:15,124 --> 00:16:18,760
<b>As for Chi- hong, he's Seok- min's favorite.</b>

255
00:16:18,761 --> 00:16:20,960
<b>- What? When did I say that? - Really?</b>

256
00:16:20,963 --> 00:16:23,560
<b>I mean, he's very fond of you.</b>

257
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:26,555
<b>He talks about you all the time, so I feel like I know you so well.</b>

258
00:16:26,635 --> 00:16:30,195
<b>By the way, why did you leave the military, Captain Ahn?</b>

259
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:33,695
<b>I bet it was because of a woman. Come on. Tell us.</b>

260
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:37,905
<b>There wasn't any special reason. I'll tell you another time.</b>

261
00:16:38,547 --> 00:16:42,575
<b>I guess I should be like that too. It makes him look all mysterious.</b>

262
00:16:43,052 --> 00:16:44,305
<b>Professor.</b>

263
00:16:45,187 --> 00:16:47,950
<b>I wasn't sure what you'd like, so I got one of each.</b>

264
00:16:47,957 --> 00:16:50,250
<b>An iced Americano, a hot Americano, and a latte.</b>

265
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:51,685
<b>Hello.</b>

266
00:16:52,461 --> 00:16:55,215
<b>What kind of story shall I tell you guys today?</b>

267
00:16:55,965 --> 00:16:58,225
<b>Dr. Chu, what happened to your face?</b>

268
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:00,830
<b>- What? - Your skin looks ashy. Are you okay?</b>

269
00:17:00,836 --> 00:17:03,995
<b>My foundation is to blame. I'm wearing 25, which is quite dark.</b>

270
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:07,810
<b>It's too dark for you. Your neck looks much lighter than your face now.</b>

271
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:10,010
<b>This is the Black Pearl Makeup.</b>

272
00:17:10,012 --> 00:17:12,840
<b>Your face looks tiny if you wear this because it makes you look tanned.</b>

273
00:17:12,848 --> 00:17:16,275
<b>You look like you went to a tanning salon because you couldn't go on vacation.</b>

274
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:19,350
<b>By the way, how did you two become friends?</b>

275
00:17:19,355 --> 00:17:21,945
<b>You're in different departments. Also, your ages and even</b>

276
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:23,945
<b>your skin colors are different.</b>

277
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:26,045
<b>We're both members of ARMY.</b>

278
00:17:26,195 --> 00:17:29,685
<b>You served in the military together? Dr. Ahn, they're your juniors.</b>

279
00:17:30,266 --> 00:17:32,885
<b>Not the army. They meant...</b>

280
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:34,930
<b>Did you get Internet service installed yesterday?</b>

281
00:17:34,937 --> 00:17:36,200
<b>Yes.</b>

282
00:17:36,205 --> 00:17:41,595
<b>I got ADSL Mega pass installed yesterday, the fastest Internet service in Korea.</b>

283
00:17:41,844 --> 00:17:44,180
<b>I sold all my acorns</b>

284
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:46,905
<b>and used up all my KTF Bigi eggs for it.</b>

285
00:17:49,452 --> 00:17:50,950
<b>- What's he saying? - Anyway...</b>

286
00:17:50,953 --> 00:17:55,490
<b>So you two like BTS. My sister is a huge fan as well.</b>

287
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:57,120
<b>Yes, we met in the fan club.</b>

288
00:17:57,126 --> 00:18:00,420
<b>Jeez, it looks like residents these days have so much time on their hands.</b>

289
00:18:00,429 --> 00:18:03,785
<b>You guys have time to join a fan club and chat like this at the cafeteria.</b>

290
00:18:04,733 --> 00:18:06,860
<b>- Back in my day- - - Professor, have this latte.</b>

291
00:18:06,869 --> 00:18:08,595
<b>- A latte. - Yes.</b>

292
00:18:11,607 --> 00:18:14,635
<b>Forget the cafeteria. We didn't even have time to eat.</b>

293
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:18,380
<b>Shall I tell you a story about when I was a resident?</b>

294
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:20,405
<b>- Bye. - Bye.</b>

295
00:18:20,983 --> 00:18:24,550
<b>However, those two on the Gongnyong Ridge.</b>

296
00:18:24,553 --> 00:18:28,645
<b>The first love. The old love. I should tell you guys the love story.</b>

297
00:18:30,059 --> 00:18:31,315
<b>My goodness.</b>

298
00:18:35,898 --> 00:18:38,755
<b>I'm not really interested though.</b>

299
00:18:39,935 --> 00:18:44,155
<b>Ik- jun and Jun- wan were always dating someone. They were both popular.</b>

300
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:47,165
<b>I'm pretty sure they always had girlfriends.</b>

301
00:18:47,243 --> 00:18:49,510
<b>Wow, really? I'm impressed.</b>

302
00:18:49,512 --> 00:18:51,580
<b>Moving on. What about Professor Yang Seok- hyeong?</b>

303
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:53,780
<b>Seok- hyeong? He barely dated.</b>

304
00:18:53,782 --> 00:18:56,550
<b>And he married the woman his parents chose.</b>

305
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:58,350
<b>They got a divorce in less than a year.</b>

306

<b>He went to the US right after that, but he did nothing but study.</b>

<b>I see.</b>

308
00:19:03,092 --> 00:19:05,745
<b>But he's in love now. So in love.</b>

309
00:19:05,928 --> 00:19:07,445
<b>What? With who?</b>

310
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:09,315

<b>Anyway, she was in a long- term relationship.</b>

<b>She dated a senior guy for a number of years.</b>

<b>They dated for over three to four years, and she dated other guys after that too.</b>

<b>If there is someone that likes him, she should give up.</b>

<b>After repairing the ventricular septal defect,</b>

00:29:46,601 --> 00:29:50,325
<b>Is there a professor named Cheon Myeong- tae in your department?</b>

457
00:29:50,705 --> 00:29:51,900
<b>Yes. Why do you ask?</b>

458
00:29:51,907 --> 00:29:55,535
<b>I heard we received an anonymous letter about a pharmaceutical company's rebate.</b>

459
00:29:55,844 --> 00:29:57,040
<b>He got a golf club membership</b>

460
00:29:57,045 --> 00:30:01,635
<b>and free meals at an upscale restaurant through them.</b>

461
00:30:02,284 --> 00:30:04,210
<b>It sounds like most CS professors did it.</b>

462
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:05,875
<b>Hey, you didn't go, right?</b>

463
00:30:16,431 --> 00:30:19,655
<b>Of course, I go often. My brother owns the golf club.</b>

464
00:30:23,271 --> 00:30:24,655
<b>By the way,</b>

465
00:30:24,739 --> 00:30:27,065
<b>who told you?</b>

466
00:30:27,776 --> 00:30:30,140
<b>That you don't need to know.</b>

467
00:30:30,145 --> 00:30:33,940
<b>I heard it was paid for with XG&YU's corporate credit card.</b>

468
00:30:33,949 --> 00:30:36,875
<b>A guy who works there put it on the wrong card.</b>

469
00:30:37,285 --> 00:30:42,045
<b>We play golf together often, so he got confused.</b>

470
00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:44,745
<b>He kept apologizing.</b>

471
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:48,015
<b>Even today, he sent me over ten messages.</b>

472
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:54,685
<b>Sir, please. Don't make me look so petty.</b>

473
00:30:54,903 --> 00:30:58,195
<b>A day on the golf course costs peanuts.</b>

474
00:30:59,341 --> 00:31:02,535
<b>"Peanuts"? I heard the membership for the golf course</b>

475
00:31:05,547 --> 00:31:07,180
<b>costs two hundred million won.</b>

476
00:31:07,182 --> 00:31:11,275
<b>My brother owns the golf club, and I'm a member too.</b>

477
00:31:11,453 --> 00:31:14,005
<b>Please believe me. It is not what you think it is.</b>

478
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:17,415
<b>Professor Kim Jun- wan</b>

479
00:31:17,859 --> 00:31:19,590
<b>got a big mouth.</b>

480
00:31:19,594 --> 00:31:21,445
<b>He kept overreacting.</b>

481
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:25,055
<b>I see that he practically wrote a novel.</b>

482
00:31:36,678 --> 00:31:40,705
<b>Stop sighing. Are you trying to make the floor collapse or what?</b>

483
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,105
<b>I'm so embarrassed.</b>

484
00:31:49,624 --> 00:31:52,320
<b>During Seon- bin's first surgery as a lead surgeon,</b>

485
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:54,745
<b>she suddenly put up both hands like this and said,</b>

486
00:31:56,631 --> 00:31:59,985
<b>"I can't do this. I'm afraid I'll end up killing this patient."</b>

487
00:32:02,437 --> 00:32:04,955
<b>Come on. Let's grab a drink together.</b>

488
00:32:05,407 --> 00:32:07,595
<b>I can't. I'm working the night shift today.</b>

489
00:32:07,742 --> 00:32:09,010
<b>Oh, boy.</b>

490
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:12,665
<b>I'm dying for a drink, but I happen to be working the night shift today.</b>

491
00:32:18,586 --> 00:32:20,480
<b>- You're still here? - How's the baby?</b>

492
00:32:20,488 --> 00:32:24,115
<b>The baby is doing okay at the moment. I'll check back later.</b>

493
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,415
<b>I hope you didn't play golf with Professor Cheon.</b>

494
00:32:28,663 --> 00:32:31,160
<b>- I did, once. - What? You did?</b>

495
00:32:31,166 --> 00:32:33,855
<b>The golf course there is really great.</b>

496
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:35,500
<b>The ball rolls in by itself.</b>

497
00:32:35,503 --> 00:32:38,500
<b>Damn it. This will turn into a headache, then.</b>

498
00:32:38,506 --> 00:32:41,595
<b>No, it won't. I paid for it myself.</b>

499
00:32:41,977 --> 00:32:42,910
<b>How?</b>

500
00:32:42,911 --> 00:32:45,740
<b>Didn't you guys use XG&YU's corporate card and their membership?</b>

501
00:32:45,747 --> 00:32:48,710
<b>I kept getting a bad feeling during the game.</b>

502
00:32:48,717 --> 00:32:50,780
<b>Professor Cheon always brags about his money,</b>

503
00:32:50,785 --> 00:32:52,850
<b>so I assumed we were using his membership.</b>

504
00:32:52,854 --> 00:32:55,550
<b>But something seemed off when we were cashing out.</b>

505
00:32:55,557 --> 00:32:57,950
<b>So I went back and asked the staff</b>

506
00:32:57,959 --> 00:33:00,115
<b>if we used their corporate credit card.</b>

507
00:33:00,362 --> 00:33:02,815
<b>He said yes, so I paid for mine on the spot and left.</b>

508
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:04,685
<b>How much did you pay?</b>

509
00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:07,230
<b>The most expensive membership is 200 million won.</b>

510
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:08,600
<b>It's usually for about 20 years,</b>

511
00:33:08,603 --> 00:33:10,430
<b>so I multiplied it by 365, and it was 7,300.</b>

512
00:33:10,438 --> 00:33:13,440
<b>Then it's about 27,397 won per day after dividing 200 million by 7,300 days.</b>

513
00:33:13,441 --> 00:33:17,070
<b>Round it up to 28,000 won. The green fee was about 150,000 won,</b>

514
00:33:17,078 --> 00:33:18,740
<b>and the cart was 20,000 won per person.</b>

515
00:33:18,747 --> 00:33:20,580
<b>On top of that, the caddie fee was 30,000 won per person.</b>

516
00:33:20,582 --> 00:33:22,905
<b>So I paid 228,000 won in total.</b>

517
00:33:24,586 --> 00:33:28,345
<b>What? My GPA was second- highest in the entire Natural Science division.</b>

518
00:33:28,556 --> 00:33:31,345
<b>Right, I'm relieved.</b>

519
00:33:31,926 --> 00:33:34,915
<b>Gosh. Knowing how much you love golf,</b>

520
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:38,085
<b>I was worried you might've hung out with them without thinking.</b>

521
00:33:39,334 --> 00:33:40,685
<b>Jeong- won.</b>

522
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:43,155
<b>These days,</b>

523
00:33:44,239 --> 00:33:46,565
<b>I'm not even thinking about golf.</b>

524
00:33:47,075 --> 00:33:48,365
<b>Bye.</b>

525
00:33:50,979 --> 00:33:52,235
<b>Goodness.</b>

526
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:57,175
<b>Professor, did you go there too?</b>

527
00:33:57,752 --> 00:33:59,620
<b>Did you play golf last weekend?</b>

528
00:33:59,621 --> 00:34:01,875
<b>It's none of your business! It's personal.</b>

529
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:04,445
<b>Why are you interrogating me like this?</b>

530
00:34:04,659 --> 00:34:06,285
<b>Gosh, you're such a nuisance.</b>

531
00:34:06,594 --> 00:34:09,360
<b>Hey, you keep acting up these days.</b>

532
00:34:09,364 --> 00:34:11,185
<b>Enough. Mind your own business.</b>

533
00:34:11,966 --> 00:34:14,855
<b>Then tell me what you did last weekend.</b>

534
00:34:16,204 --> 00:34:17,955
<b>What did you do last weekend?</b>

535
00:34:18,907 --> 00:34:20,170
<b>I ate <i>jajangmyeon</i>.</b>

536
00:34:20,175 --> 00:34:22,395
<i><b>Jajangmyeon</i>? What?</b>

537
00:34:23,945 --> 00:34:26,435
<b>I had <i>buljajangmyeon</i>. Are we good now?</b>

538
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:33,275
<b>Good call.</b>

539
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:42,455
<b>BEST MENU: <i>BULJAJANGMYEON</i> NEW MENU: NUKE <i>BULJAJANGMYEON</i></b>

540
00:34:45,533 --> 00:34:48,385
<b>Look at this name. It's so gutsy.</b>

541
00:34:48,470 --> 00:34:49,870
<b>Don't your colleagues complain?</b>

542
00:34:49,871 --> 00:34:51,795
<b>Even our commander is a regular here.</b>

543
00:34:54,042 --> 00:34:59,135
<b>AUTHENTIC CHINESE RESTAURANT NUCLEAR KITCHEN</b>

544
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:02,005
<b>Enjoy.</b>

545
00:35:04,085 --> 00:35:06,420
<b>It's one level below the one we had last week.</b>

546
00:35:06,421 --> 00:35:10,645
<b>- Which level is this? - Level Four. Last week, we had Level Five.</b>

547
00:35:10,725 --> 00:35:13,645
<b>- Were you okay last week? - I almost had to go to the ER.</b>

548
00:35:14,762 --> 00:35:19,430
<b>I can definitely handle spicy food, but the one we had last week was hard.</b>

549
00:35:19,434 --> 00:35:22,555
<b>This one looks quite spicy too.</b>

550
00:35:22,871 --> 00:35:26,925
<b>The <i>buljajangmyeon</i> here should be used as the ROKA's new secret weapon.</b>

551
00:35:27,675 --> 00:35:30,695
<b>Watch what you say. My unit is right across the street.</b>

552
00:35:30,912 --> 00:35:33,440
<b>Who cares? My girlfriend is a major.</b>

553
00:35:33,448 --> 00:35:35,280
<b>I bet only a handful of people outrank you.</b>

554
00:35:35,283 --> 00:35:38,920
<b>No, there are so many officers who outrank me. There's a ton.</b>

555
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:42,205
<b>A lieutenant general, then a general?</b>

556
00:35:45,093 --> 00:35:47,815
<b>Jun- wan. You were exempted, weren't you?</b>

557
00:35:49,264 --> 00:35:52,285
<b>There's no three- star general in my division.</b>

558
00:35:52,934 --> 00:35:57,295
<b>I knew it. I wondered how you became a professor before my brother did.</b>

559
00:36:01,075 --> 00:36:03,035
<b>That's right. I was exempted.</b>

560
00:36:04,279 --> 00:36:08,635
<b>What do you say? Do you want to hear my story? It's very long.</b>

561
00:36:08,783 --> 00:36:10,875
<b>No, thanks. I'm sure you had your reason.</b>

562
00:36:10,952 --> 00:36:15,245
<b>By the way, did you just mix my <i>jajangmyeon</i> for me?</b>

563
00:36:15,456 --> 00:36:16,845
<b>Yes.</b>

564
00:36:18,826 --> 00:36:21,315
<b>I'm so touched.</b>

565
00:36:21,896 --> 00:36:23,555
<b>What? This is nothing.</b>

566
00:36:27,669 --> 00:36:30,930
<b>Do you do this for my brother or your roomie, Jeong- won?</b>

567
00:36:30,939 --> 00:36:32,495
<b>Hell no.</b>

568
00:36:33,241 --> 00:36:36,240
<b>Why would I do it for them? We're always busy stuffing our own faces.</b>

569
00:36:36,244 --> 00:36:37,770
<b>I don't even do it for my mom.</b>

570
00:36:37,779 --> 00:36:39,205
<b>Because it's you...</b>

571
00:36:43,017 --> 00:36:44,775
<b>I only do it for you.</b>

572
00:37:26,694 --> 00:37:28,520
<b>Did you get an emergency call already?</b>

573
00:37:28,529 --> 00:37:30,455
<b>No, I'm late.</b>

574
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:32,560
<b>Don't you still have some time until your rounds?</b>

575
00:37:32,567 --> 00:37:34,800
<b>I'm late for breakfast. I never skip breakfast.</b>

576
00:37:34,802 --> 00:37:36,655
<b>Oh, Dr. Jang Gyeo- ul is here.</b>

577
00:37:37,038 --> 00:37:39,340
<b>What? It's fall already?</b>

578
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:41,495
<b>Gosh, is fall here already?</b>

579
00:37:41,609 --> 00:37:45,965
<b>Right? I put on this trench coat today because of her.</b>

580
00:37:46,547 --> 00:37:48,605
<b>What are you two talking about?</b>

581
00:37:48,916 --> 00:37:51,850
<b>When you start wearing your denim shirt, that means fall is here.</b>

582
00:37:51,853 --> 00:37:54,345
<b>When we see your white T- shirt, we know it's summer.</b>

583
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:57,815
<b>For us, you're like an indicator of the passage of time.</b>

584
00:37:57,992 --> 00:37:59,490
<b>So I'm like your human calendar.</b>

585
00:37:59,494 --> 00:38:02,045
<b>- Exactly. - Let's go, Dr. Jang.</b>

586
00:38:02,063 --> 00:38:05,755
<b>Breakfast is on me since you informed me that fall is here.</b>

587
00:38:06,601 --> 00:38:08,400
<b>You'll buy me breakfast?</b>

588
00:38:08,403 --> 00:38:12,595
<b>Yes, Professor Kim Jun- wan gave me his card.</b>

589
00:38:13,007 --> 00:38:15,425
<b>He gave me this yesterday, but I haven't returned it.</b>

590
00:38:16,177 --> 00:38:20,210
<b>Something good must've happened to him. He's always in a good mood.</b>

591
00:38:20,214 --> 00:38:22,935
<b>I bet he has no idea that I still have his card.</b>

592
00:38:23,217 --> 00:38:24,605
<b>Let's hurry.</b>

593
00:38:28,122 --> 00:38:29,850
<b>A male patient, age 29.</b>

594
00:38:29,857 --> 00:38:32,615
<b>Based on his MRI, it looks like he has an astrocytoma.</b>

595
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:35,930
<b>The tumor is in the dominant hemisphere, and the size is about 7cm.</b>

596
00:38:35,930 --> 00:38:39,655
<b>We'll have him get a navigation CT and a TFCA this afternoon.</b>

597
00:38:39,934 --> 00:38:43,325
<b>Doctor. The surgery won't be difficult, right?</b>

598
00:38:43,471 --> 00:38:48,770
<b>Everyone around us is worried, saying awake surgery is a difficult procedure.</b>

599
00:38:48,776 --> 00:38:51,270
<b>There aren't any easy brain surgeries.</b>

600
00:38:51,279 --> 00:38:53,735
<b>Awake surgery is an especially complicated procedure.</b>

601
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:57,610
<b>As I explained before, Hyeon- su's tumor</b>

602
00:38:57,618 --> 00:39:01,050
<b>has seeped into his normal brain tissues, so the divide has been blurred.</b>

603
00:39:01,055 --> 00:39:03,475
<b>That's why I think awake surgery will be helpful.</b>

604
00:39:03,491 --> 00:39:08,160
<b>Based on my experience, it's highly likely that the tumor is affecting</b>

605
00:39:08,162 --> 00:39:10,990
<b>the parts of his brain that perform important functions.</b>

606
00:39:10,998 --> 00:39:13,500
<b>We'll wake him up briefly during the surgery</b>

607
00:39:13,501 --> 00:39:17,430
<b>so that we can remove the tumor while checking his neurological symptoms.</b>

608
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:19,670
<b>He's still young,</b>

609
00:39:19,674 --> 00:39:23,410
<b>so it's very important to minimize post- surgical neurological complications.</b>

610
00:39:23,411 --> 00:39:25,495
<b>How long will the surgery take?</b>

611
00:39:25,546 --> 00:39:28,080
<b>It all depends,</b>

612
00:39:28,082 --> 00:39:30,610
<b>but it usually takes seven to eight hours.</b>

613
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:34,650
<b>And the amount of time the patient is kept awake can vary,</b>

614
00:39:34,655 --> 00:39:37,345
<b>but I'd say it usually ranges from 30 minutes to an hour.</b>

615
00:39:38,159 --> 00:39:40,590
<b>I'll quickly figure out brain functions around the tumor</b>

616
00:39:40,595 --> 00:39:43,460
<b>so that we can minimize the time he has to stay awake for.</b>

617
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:45,825
<b>The experience can traumatize some patients.</b>

618
00:39:46,167 --> 00:39:47,425
<b>Okay.</b>

619
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:49,030
<b>You have a day before the surgery,</b>

620
00:39:49,036 --> 00:39:52,770
<b>so let us know if you're too scared or concerned.</b>

621
00:39:52,774 --> 00:39:54,725
<b>Your condition matters the most.</b>

622
00:39:55,343 --> 00:39:58,065
<b>I don't care.</b>

623
00:39:58,346 --> 00:40:00,465
<b>I'll do as you say.</b>

624
00:40:00,715 --> 00:40:05,780
<b>Hyeon- su, you can work again after you get this surgery.</b>

625
00:40:05,787 --> 00:40:07,680
<b>Don't be so listless.</b>

626
00:40:07,688 --> 00:40:10,315
<b>How can I go back to work?</b>

627
00:40:10,858 --> 00:40:12,860
<b>Stop talking nonsense, Mom.</b>

628
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:16,830
<b>Why not? You can totally do it.</b>

629
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:20,730
<b>I heard you're a cop. It's very difficult to become a cop.</b>

630
00:40:20,735 --> 00:40:24,470
<b>You even passed that difficult exam, so don't be like this.</b>

631
00:40:24,472 --> 00:40:27,725
<b>Hyeon- su, you can get through this.</b>

632
00:40:28,009 --> 00:40:33,210
<b>Doctor, I don't care whether or not he can go back to being a cop.</b>

633
00:40:33,214 --> 00:40:34,505
<b>Please</b>

634
00:40:35,183 --> 00:40:36,905
<b>just save my son.</b>

635
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:40,145
<b>Yes, we'll do our very best.</b>

636
00:40:40,354 --> 00:40:41,775
<b>See you.</b>

637
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:50,115
<b>What happened with Sin Mi- jin's liver index?</b>

638
00:40:50,231 --> 00:40:51,930
<b>Her ALT is over 300.</b>

639
00:40:51,933 --> 00:40:53,230
<b>ALT: A TRANSAMINASE ENZYME</b>

640
00:40:53,234 --> 00:40:55,400
<b>Her bilirubin is over 10 as well.</b>

641
00:40:55,403 --> 00:40:57,100
<b>HIGH LEVELS OF BILIRUBIN CAUSES JAUNDICE</b>

642
00:40:57,104 --> 00:41:00,125
<b>The rejection reaction was low. Why did it suddenly spike?</b>

643
00:41:00,374 --> 00:41:02,695
<b>I actually ran into her in the hallway.</b>

644
00:41:02,944 --> 00:41:05,335
<b>Well, I'll tell you later.</b>

645
00:41:07,215 --> 00:41:08,835
<b>I don't feel</b>

646
00:41:10,218 --> 00:41:12,750
<b>so bad. I feel all right.</b>

647
00:41:12,753 --> 00:41:15,250
<b>You're not all right. These numbers tell me that you need</b>

648
00:41:15,256 --> 00:41:18,545
<b>to check in right away for tests and treatment. It's not looking good.</b>

649
00:41:19,927 --> 00:41:22,185
<b>Have you been taking your medication?</b>

650
00:41:25,032 --> 00:41:27,225
<b>It doesn't look like you've been taking it.</b>

651
00:41:33,774 --> 00:41:36,865
<b>To me, it seems like you've been off your medication for a while.</b>

652
00:41:37,278 --> 00:41:39,405
<b>Did something happen?</b>

653
00:41:40,548 --> 00:41:43,250
<b>If you continue to skip your medication,</b>

654
00:41:43,251 --> 00:41:46,450
<b>your liver will get all ruined, and you may need another transplant.</b>

655
00:41:46,454 --> 00:41:48,820
<b>The liver won't function. Let's get you checked in.</b>

656
00:41:48,823 --> 00:41:50,145
<b>No,</b>

657
00:41:50,391 --> 00:41:52,645
<b>I don't want to be hospitalized.</b>

658
00:41:55,429 --> 00:41:57,915
<b>I just want to die, Doctor.</b>

659
00:41:59,367 --> 00:42:01,855
<b>What are you talking about?</b>

660
00:42:02,003 --> 00:42:04,830
<b>I worked very hard on your surgery. Please don't say that to me.</b>

661
00:42:04,839 --> 00:42:07,070
<b>Let's get you admitted and get a CT scan of your liver.</b>

662
00:42:07,074 --> 00:42:10,140
<b>Then, we'll run a biopsy while doing your ultrasound.</b>

663
00:42:10,144 --> 00:42:12,335
<b>We'll also treat transplant rejection.</b>

664

<b>He's a nine- year- old boy, who complained of pain in his right abdomen,</b>

665
00:42:19,153 --> 00:42:21,150
<b>so I took a CT and it showed appendicitis.</b>

666
00:42:21,155 --> 00:42:24,375
<b>He has a fever and a high level of CRP.</b>

667
00:42:24,692 --> 00:42:26,620
<b>Since when did it start to hurt?</b>

668
00:42:26,627 --> 00:42:28,860
<b>Last night.</b>

669
00:42:28,863 --> 00:42:32,855
<b>Oh, no. Let me take a look. All right.</b>

670
00:42:34,535 --> 00:42:36,300
<b>I'll talk to the guardian.</b>

671
00:42:36,304 --> 00:42:38,670
<b>Dr. Jang, please call Anesthesiology now.</b>

672
00:42:38,673 --> 00:42:40,040
<b>Okay.</b>

673
00:42:40,041 --> 00:42:41,940
<b>- Hello, Professor Ahn. - Hi.</b>

674
00:42:41,943 --> 00:42:43,365
<b>Professor Ahn.</b>

675
00:42:43,611 --> 00:42:45,735
<b>Can we watch a movie together next time?</b>

676
00:42:46,614 --> 00:42:48,905
<b>Sure. Let's watch one together when we have time.</b>

677
00:42:49,050 --> 00:42:50,705
<b>Bye.</b>

678
00:42:53,788 --> 00:42:55,405
<b>What do you mean, "next time"?</b>

679
00:42:55,590 --> 00:42:57,120
<b>Did you two meet in private?</b>

680
00:42:57,124 --> 00:43:00,715
<b>Yes. I had dinner with Professor Ahn last weekend.</b>

681
00:43:00,861 --> 00:43:02,885
<b>Just the two of us? Outside the hospital?</b>

682
00:43:03,030 --> 00:43:05,900
<b>Yes. Just the two of us, outside the hospital.</b>

683
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:07,725
<b>In our own clothes, not in scrubs.</b>

684
00:43:08,169 --> 00:43:11,155
<b>Did Professor Ahn ask you to have dinner with him?</b>

685
00:43:11,572 --> 00:43:13,225
<b>Well, I asked him.</b>

686
00:43:13,374 --> 00:43:14,570
<b>I asked him to buy me dinner.</b>

687
00:43:14,575 --> 00:43:18,540
<b>My gosh. Professor Ahn is known to buy a lot of people meals.</b>

688
00:43:18,546 --> 00:43:21,835
<b>He has a get- together with the nurses often, too.</b>

689
00:43:21,882 --> 00:43:23,850
<b>- I thought it was different. - It was just us.</b>

690
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:26,020
<b>It doesn't matter if it was just with you or 20 people.</b>

691
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:28,505
<b>When people ask him to buy them a meal, he always does.</b>

692
00:43:29,056 --> 00:43:31,890
<b>Dr. Bae. You know what?</b>

693
00:43:31,892 --> 00:43:35,690
<b>I even watched a movie with Professor Ahn. I'm serious.</b>

<b>Hey, give them to me. Let me try them.</b>

00:47:14,281 --> 00:47:16,850
<b>Yes, I want to listen to music,</b>

755
00:47:16,851 --> 00:47:19,650
<b>but the Bluetooth isn't working. Have you tried it before?</b>

756
00:47:19,653 --> 00:47:21,620
<b>- Hey, forget about the music. - Yes, I answer phone calls</b>

757
00:47:21,622 --> 00:47:23,490
<b>- and listen to music! - Jun- wan, who is she?</b>

758
00:47:23,490 --> 00:47:26,845
<b>- Was it a blind date? An arranged meeting? - No, I didn't go on a blind date.</b>

759
00:47:29,263 --> 00:47:30,955
<b>It's not working.</b>

760
00:47:31,031 --> 00:47:33,730
<b>Jun- wan, it's not working because it's connected to your phone.</b>

761
00:47:33,734 --> 00:47:35,755
<b>Jun- wan, do I know her?</b>

762
00:47:36,704 --> 00:47:38,930
<b>Hey, do we know this lady?</b>

763
00:47:38,939 --> 00:47:42,170
<b>My friend, does she work at the hospital or did we know her from school?</b>

764
00:47:42,176 --> 00:47:43,670
<b>Song- hwa, lower the volume.</b>

765
00:47:43,677 --> 00:47:46,380
<b>No, don't. Can you increase the volume? Please. I'm begging you.</b>

766
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:49,205
<b>My gosh. Why isn't this connecting?</b>

767
00:47:50,150 --> 00:47:51,110
<b>What?</b>

768
00:47:51,118 --> 00:47:52,010
<b>MY LOVELY <i>BIDULGI</i></b>

769

<b>Jun- wan.</b>

00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:55,905
<b>Someone saved as <i>Bidulgi</i> is calling you.</b>

771
00:47:58,659 --> 00:48:00,560
<b>Hey, eyes on the road. Will you kill us all?</b>

772
00:48:00,561 --> 00:48:03,530
<b>Baby... I mean Jeong- won, can you take out my phone in the bag?</b>

773
00:48:03,530 --> 00:48:05,190
<b>Take it out and decline the call.</b>

774
00:48:05,199 --> 00:48:07,300
<b>I see. Your phone is in your bag, sweetie?</b>

775
00:48:07,301 --> 00:48:09,630
<b>- Sure, sweetie. - Jeong- won, quickly. Hurry.</b>

776
00:48:09,637 --> 00:48:11,700
<b>No, forget it. Jeong- won, leave it.</b>

777
00:48:11,705 --> 00:48:12,640
<b>Hello.</b>

778
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,640
<b>- Your cell phone. - Hello. Hi.</b>

779
00:48:14,642 --> 00:48:16,170
<b>Hey, we're here.</b>

780
00:48:16,176 --> 00:48:18,840
<b>- There are a lot of empty parking spots. - Yes.</b>

781
00:48:18,846 --> 00:48:21,135
<b>Where's your phone, sweetie?</b>

782
00:48:21,215 --> 00:48:22,310
<b>Mom?</b>

783
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:25,010
<b>I'm out with my friends to have dinner.</b>

784

787
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:34,020
<b>Okay.</b>

788
00:48:34,028 --> 00:48:35,515
<b>- I found it. - Give me that.</b>

789
00:48:37,197 --> 00:48:38,785
<b>Hello?</b>

790
00:48:38,866 --> 00:48:42,025
<b>I'm Kim Jun- wan's friend, Lee Ik- jun.</b>

791
00:48:42,336 --> 00:48:44,670
<b>He can't answer the phone right now.</b>

792
00:48:44,672 --> 00:48:46,740
<b>If I may, please tell me your name.</b>

793
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:48,840
<b>I'll make sure I tell him- -</b>

794
00:48:48,842 --> 00:48:52,240
<b>I would like to do that, but he took the phone.</b>

795
00:48:52,246 --> 00:48:53,505
<b>Yes.</b>

796
00:48:53,681 --> 00:48:55,010
<b>Okay. Yes.</b>

797
00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:57,280
<b>I'm starving. They serve <i>nurungji,</i> too, right?</b>

798
00:48:57,284 --> 00:48:59,520
<b>Yes. They serve <i>nurungji</i> and perilla seed <i>sujuebi</i>.</b>

799
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:00,950
<b>Jun- wan, we'll be inside.</b>

800
00:49:00,955 --> 00:49:03,190
<b>It's already getting chilly.</b>

801
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:05,090
<b>It's pretty chilly at night.</b>

802
00:49:05,092 --> 00:49:06,190
<b>It's autumn now.</b>

803
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:08,460
<b>This chilly weather is making me miss my sister.</b>

804
00:49:08,462 --> 00:49:10,885
<b>That never happened to me.</b>

805
00:49:12,266 --> 00:49:15,655
<b>Even so, I think it's better that you tell her.</b>

806
00:49:16,437 --> 00:49:17,855
<b>Really?</b>

807
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:20,740
<b>I really can't decide.</b>

808
00:49:20,741 --> 00:49:24,035
<b>Of course, you should tell your mom. Why are you even thinking about it?</b>

809
00:49:24,111 --> 00:49:25,940
<b>Don't make her feel like a fool.</b>

810
00:49:25,946 --> 00:49:27,810
<b>You should tell her everything that everyone knows,</b>

811
00:49:27,815 --> 00:49:30,310
<b>so she divorces your dad right away and lives a better life.</b>

812
00:49:30,317 --> 00:49:32,280
<b>He's worried because of her health.</b>

813
00:49:32,286 --> 00:49:34,420
<b>What if he tells her and she collapses again</b>

814
00:49:34,421 --> 00:49:36,205
<b>from the shock? What then?</b>

815
00:49:36,657 --> 00:49:38,215
<b>But at the same time,</b>

816
00:49:38,392 --> 00:49:40,715
<b>I think she should know about it.</b>

817
00:49:43,664 --> 00:49:47,925
<b>Are you and Song- hwa possessed by ghosts who'd starved for years?</b>

818
00:49:48,102 --> 00:49:49,500
<b>I have three older brothers.</b>

819
00:49:49,503 --> 00:49:51,525
<b>I'm really possessed by a ghost.</b>

820
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:53,695
<b>- Jeong- won, water, please. - Okay.</b>

821
00:49:54,575 --> 00:49:56,025
<b>Ma'am.</b>

822
00:49:57,745 --> 00:50:01,065
<b>I should tell her, so it gets rid of the slightest affection she has left.</b>

823
00:50:01,415 --> 00:50:03,935
<b>Well, I don't think there's any ounce of affection left.</b>

824
00:50:04,084 --> 00:50:06,650
<b>But then, I thought it would be better to tell her</b>

825
00:50:06,653 --> 00:50:08,580
<b>to get a divorce since that lady is pregnant,</b>

826
00:50:08,589 --> 00:50:10,850
<b>so that Mom could live freely without any stress.</b>

827
00:50:10,858 --> 00:50:12,915
<b>But then again,</b>

828
00:50:13,961 --> 00:50:15,190
<b>they are already strangers.</b>

829
00:50:15,195 --> 00:50:18,115
<b>And what if her health gets worse because of the shock?</b>

830
00:50:18,165 --> 00:50:19,460
<b>I really don't want that.</b>

831
00:50:19,466 --> 00:50:21,360
<b>But wouldn't it better to tell her?</b>

832
00:50:21,368 --> 00:50:22,755
<b>I agree.</b>

833
00:50:23,404 --> 00:50:24,695
<b>What about you?</b>

834
00:50:25,839 --> 00:50:27,295
<b>Tell her or don't?</b>

835
00:50:27,541 --> 00:50:29,395
<b>You should tell her.</b>

836
00:50:31,178 --> 00:50:32,170
<b>What should I do?</b>

837
00:50:32,179 --> 00:50:34,680
<b>- Just tell her. - Tell her.</b>

838
00:50:34,681 --> 00:50:37,075
<b>Hey, Song- hwa. What do you think?</b>

839
00:50:38,385 --> 00:50:39,945
<b>Well,</b>

840
00:50:40,187 --> 00:50:41,720
<b>I agree. I think you should tell her.</b>

841
00:50:41,722 --> 00:50:43,275
<b>Really?</b>

842
00:50:43,524 --> 00:50:46,120
<b>Yes. I think she should know.</b>

843
00:50:46,126 --> 00:50:48,115
<b>Let her down gently.</b>

844
00:50:48,195 --> 00:50:50,660
<b>Make sure to comfort her before and after telling the news.</b>

845
00:50:50,664 --> 00:50:52,290
<b>Okay. I'll tell her.</b>

846
00:50:52,299 --> 00:50:55,400
<b>We've been telling you that for ten minutes. You never take our advice.</b>

847
00:50:55,402 --> 00:50:58,700
<b>If you are going to do this, you should just ask her for the advice.</b>

848
00:50:58,705 --> 00:51:00,240
<b>Go drink some tea separately.</b>

849
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:02,000
<b>We're just fillers here.</b>

850
00:51:02,009 --> 00:51:03,840
<b>The owner personally dug up the arrowroot,</b>

851
00:51:03,844 --> 00:51:06,510
<b>and it's on us, too.</b>

852
00:51:06,513 --> 00:51:08,605
<b>Does anyone want it?</b>

853
00:51:09,383 --> 00:51:11,210
<b>Okay. Please wait.</b>

854
00:51:11,218 --> 00:51:12,310
<b>I'll bring it over.</b>

855
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:14,150
<b>- Thank you. - Thank you.</b>

856
00:51:14,154 --> 00:51:17,475
<b>YULJE MEDICAL CENTER</b>

857
00:51:18,759 --> 00:51:20,685
<b>Hey, you did well.</b>

858
00:51:21,361 --> 00:51:23,160
<b>Your mother is okay, right?</b>

859
00:51:23,163 --> 00:51:26,655
<b>Yes, she took the news better than I expected.</b>

860
00:51:27,201 --> 00:51:28,660
<b>At first, she was really shocked.</b>

861
00:51:28,669 --> 00:51:31,795
<b>She didn't say a word for ten minutes, so I was worried.</b>

862
00:51:32,172 --> 00:51:35,025
<b>But I comforted her afterward. She's divorcing him.</b>

863
00:51:35,209 --> 00:51:38,035
<b>She said she wanted to emigrate because she's humiliated.</b>

864
00:51:42,082 --> 00:51:45,675
<b>It's all right. You guys managed to get through such an unpleasant incident.</b>

865
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:48,845
<b>You weren't in your office, so I knew you'd be here.</b>

866
00:51:51,258 --> 00:51:53,860
<b>You should have at least dried your hair. Goodness.</b>

867
00:51:53,861 --> 00:51:56,685
<b>I guess you couldn't wait to tell Song- hwa.</b>

868
00:51:58,398 --> 00:52:01,625
<b>You haven't seen him yet, right? But I guess he told you right away.</b>

869
00:52:01,768 --> 00:52:03,295
<b>What are you talking about?</b>

870
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:06,995
<b>We were just talking about how he told her about the pregnancy.</b>

871
00:52:07,141 --> 00:52:09,065
<b>Why? Is something going on?</b>

872
00:52:09,743 --> 00:52:12,980
<b>Seok- hyeong's father got admitted to the hospital last night.</b>

873
00:52:12,980 --> 00:52:15,405
<b>At our hospital. He's in VIP Room Three.</b>

874
00:52:15,582 --> 00:52:17,110
<b>Is he sick?</b>

875
00:52:17,117 --> 00:52:19,305
<b>No, he's faking it.</b>

876
00:52:20,954 --> 00:52:24,390
<b>He kept getting summoned by the court, so I think he got admitted here.</b>

877
00:52:24,391 --> 00:52:26,260
<b>He didn't request me as his physician.</b>

878
00:52:26,260 --> 00:52:29,545
<b>I think his secretary directly called the hospital director.</b>

879
00:52:32,232 --> 00:52:34,555
<b>Hey. Visit him later.</b>

880
00:52:35,002 --> 00:52:36,485
<b>I'll go with you later.</b>

881
00:52:36,637 --> 00:52:38,425
<b>It's time to meet the outpatients.</b>

882
00:52:42,609 --> 00:52:46,265
<b>Jun- wan. Do not treat Chairman Yang.</b>

883
00:52:47,147 --> 00:52:48,405
<b>Okay?</b>

884
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:50,875
<b>Yes.</b>

885
00:52:54,788 --> 00:52:56,550
<b>She took the morning medication</b>

886
00:52:56,557 --> 00:52:58,790
<b>because Nurse Song literally begged her to take it.</b>

887
00:52:58,792 --> 00:53:00,520
<b>But I don't know if she'll take it tonight.</b>

888
00:53:00,527 --> 00:53:02,690
<b>Judging from this morning, I doubt that she will.</b>

889
00:53:02,696 --> 00:53:05,490
<b>I get that she hates her husband, but if her health deteriorates,</b>

890
00:53:05,499 --> 00:53:06,855
<b>it's her loss.</b>

891
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:08,760
<b>I can somewhat understand her.</b>

892
00:53:08,769 --> 00:53:11,630
<b>It doesn't matter if her husband donated his liver. He cheated on her.</b>

893
00:53:11,638 --> 00:53:14,425
<b>Would you want to live with the liver of a cheating husband?</b>

894
00:53:14,575 --> 00:53:17,470
<b>She probably hates her husband and her new liver. I'd hate everything.</b>

895
00:53:17,477 --> 00:53:20,405
<b>Even so, she has to take her medication.</b>

896
00:53:20,547 --> 00:53:22,010
<b>Did you sleep well?</b>

897
00:53:22,015 --> 00:53:24,580
<b>Yes, I slept well. It's been a while since I had good sleep.</b>

898
00:53:24,585 --> 00:53:26,720
<b>I'm glad to hear that. You must exercise a lot.</b>

899
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:28,680
<b>Try to walk the hallways whenever you can.</b>

900
00:53:28,689 --> 00:53:30,920
<b>Yes. I went back and forth ten times yesterday.</b>

901
00:53:30,924 --> 00:53:33,915
<b>I think I can even participate in the Olympics.</b>

902
00:53:33,994 --> 00:53:37,685
<b>Doctor, are you married?</b>

903
00:53:37,864 --> 00:53:39,115
<b>Pardon?</b>

904
00:53:39,166 --> 00:53:41,485
<b>Why do you ask? Are you going to set him up?</b>

905
00:53:41,702 --> 00:53:43,530
<b>Yes, I have a younger sister.</b>

906
00:53:43,537 --> 00:53:45,470
<b>I want to set you up with my sister.</b>

907
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:47,925
<b>My goodness. Oh, my.</b>

908
00:53:48,008 --> 00:53:50,335
<b>I'm married. And I have a son, too.</b>

909
00:53:50,377 --> 00:53:54,340
<b>I should've known. Women wouldn't have let a fine man like you alone.</b>

910
00:53:54,348 --> 00:53:55,980
<b>No, I married late.</b>

911
00:53:55,983 --> 00:53:57,850
<b>I wonder what lucky woman married you.</b>

912
00:53:57,851 --> 00:53:59,575
<b>It's a pity you are married.</b>

913
00:53:59,886 --> 00:54:02,805
<b>Seriously, you're my type.</b>

914
00:54:03,357 --> 00:54:04,645
<b>My gosh.</b>

915
00:54:05,058 --> 00:54:08,090
<b>Goodness, you're flattering me. Your husband is here.</b>

916
00:54:08,095 --> 00:54:11,315
<b>I mean, look at you, Doctor. You're handsome.</b>

917
00:54:11,398 --> 00:54:13,460
<b>And I bet you got good grades.</b>

918
00:54:13,467 --> 00:54:16,285
<b>You're so amiable and great at your job.</b>

919
00:54:16,570 --> 00:54:19,200
<b>You're totally my type. My gosh.</b>

920
00:54:19,206 --> 00:54:21,840
<b>But my husband is a slug.</b>

921
00:54:21,842 --> 00:54:24,870
<b>But he has such a likable face and a good build.</b>

922
00:54:24,878 --> 00:54:27,040
<b>He does, doesn't he?</b>

923
00:54:27,047 --> 00:54:28,240
<b>He runs a jewelry shop.</b>

924
00:54:28,248 --> 00:54:30,880
<b>He has a shop in Ssangmun- dong. It's called Phoenix Shop.</b>

925
00:54:30,884 --> 00:54:32,305
<b>I see.</b>

926
00:54:35,789 --> 00:54:37,515
<b>I picked it up on my way here.</b>

927
00:54:38,959 --> 00:54:40,860
<b>My gosh, no. I should get going.</b>

928
00:54:40,861 --> 00:54:43,660
<b>Doctor, it's coming from the bottom of my heart.</b>

929
00:54:43,664 --> 00:54:46,930
<b>I want to give you everything I have. I am so grateful for your help.</b>

930
00:54:46,933 --> 00:54:48,760
<b>My son won this at a contest.</b>

931
00:54:48,769 --> 00:54:50,900
<b>No, I can't accept this. If I do, I'll be in trouble.</b>

932
00:54:50,904 --> 00:54:52,930
<b>- I'm serious. - Doctor, it's from my heart.</b>

933
00:54:52,939 --> 00:54:55,440
<b>You saved my wife. I am so thankful for it.</b>

934
00:54:55,442 --> 00:54:57,140
<b>- Please accept this. - Wait.</b>

935
00:54:57,144 --> 00:54:58,440
<b>I'll be back later.</b>

936
00:54:58,445 --> 00:55:00,280
<b>- Bye. - Doctor.</b>

937
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:01,880
<b>- What? - Rest up, ma'am.</b>

938
00:55:01,882 --> 00:55:03,810
<b>I guess doctors can't accept gifts these days.</b>

939
00:55:03,817 --> 00:55:06,110
<b>How is the baby? The baby is active, right?</b>

940
00:55:06,119 --> 00:55:09,280
<b>- Yes. - It's been 24 weeks now.</b>

941
00:55:09,289 --> 00:55:13,620
<b>All right. The black part on the scan is the amniotic fluid.</b>

942
00:55:13,627 --> 00:55:15,815
<b>When you look at the scan...</b>

943
00:55:19,433 --> 00:55:21,655
<b>- I'm sorry. - It's okay.</b>

944
00:55:24,971 --> 00:55:27,025
<b>Hello. What is this about?</b>

945
00:55:28,575 --> 00:55:31,310
<i><b>I had a bad feeling about it in case- - </i></b>

946
00:55:31,311 --> 00:55:34,105
<b>Okay. I got it.</b>

947
00:55:39,953 --> 00:55:41,445
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

948
00:56:05,512 --> 00:56:08,465
<b>I guess they don't use that anymore these days.</b>

949
00:56:18,325 --> 00:56:20,215
<b>Hello, Ms. Sin.</b>

950
00:56:20,794 --> 00:56:22,560
<b>Hello.</b>

951
00:56:22,562 --> 00:56:23,890
<b>Did you eat?</b>

952
00:56:23,897 --> 00:56:25,560
<b>She ate very little.</b>

953
00:56:25,565 --> 00:56:26,960
<b>Why?</b>

954
00:56:26,967 --> 00:56:28,730
<b>You should eat a lot.</b>

955
00:56:28,735 --> 00:56:30,700
<b>Hospital meals are expensive.</b>

956
00:56:30,704 --> 00:56:33,725
<b>You should eat a lot. That's a waste of money if you don't.</b>

957
00:56:33,974 --> 00:56:35,395
<b>Doctor,</b>

958
00:56:36,376 --> 00:56:38,310
<b>I'm sure you heard about my situation.</b>

959
00:56:38,311 --> 00:56:41,005
<b>That my husband cheated on me.</b>

960
00:56:42,849 --> 00:56:44,175
<b>Yes.</b>

961
00:56:45,752 --> 00:56:48,680
<b>Because he's having an affair with another woman,</b>

962
00:56:48,688 --> 00:56:52,275
<b>he felt guilty, so that's why he gave me a piece of his liver.</b>

963
00:56:52,392 --> 00:56:54,715
<b>To feel better about himself.</b>

964
00:56:55,095 --> 00:56:57,085
<b>I'm sure that's not true.</b>

965
00:56:57,164 --> 00:57:01,325
<b>Your husband took very good care of you when you got the transplant surgery.</b>

966
00:57:01,368 --> 00:57:05,000
<b>He held my hand and cried a lot at night.</b>

967
00:57:05,005 --> 00:57:08,395
<b>You're very naive.</b>

968
00:57:09,743 --> 00:57:14,235
<b>It sounds like you lived a good life without undergoing any hardships.</b>

969
00:57:15,382 --> 00:57:17,175
<b>How do you feel today?</b>

970
00:57:18,185 --> 00:57:21,050
<b>Luckily, the CT scan shows the biliary duct isn't stretched.</b>

971
00:57:21,054 --> 00:57:23,450
<b>You didn't take any immunosuppressants,</b>

972
00:57:23,457 --> 00:57:25,920
<b>so your body had acute transplantation rejection.</b>

973
00:57:25,926 --> 00:57:27,890
<b>We'll treat it with a high dose of steroids.</b>

974
00:57:27,894 --> 00:57:30,290
<b>And once you start taking immunosuppressants,</b>

975
00:57:30,297 --> 00:57:32,785
<b>you'll recover, so don't worry.</b>

976
00:57:33,467 --> 00:57:35,625
<b>I'm not worried, Doctor.</b>

977
00:57:38,104 --> 00:57:39,795
<b>I don't want</b>

978
00:57:41,608 --> 00:57:43,635
<b>to live with his liver.</b>

979
00:57:45,579 --> 00:57:47,305
<b>Goodness.</b>

980
00:57:48,782 --> 00:57:53,150
<b>I had no idea that my husband was cheating on me with a younger woman.</b>

981
00:57:53,153 --> 00:57:55,545
<b>I even made a deep bow to him.</b>

982
00:57:56,857 --> 00:57:58,715
<b>Gosh.</b>

983
00:57:59,626 --> 00:58:02,060
<b>Doctor, he gave me a piece of his liver,</b>

984
00:58:02,062 --> 00:58:05,655
<b>so he wouldn't feel guilty about the affair.</b>

985
00:58:05,799 --> 00:58:07,900
<b>He was just sorry.</b>

986
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:12,025
<b>I'm sure that's not true. Your husband can't be that evil.</b>

987
00:58:14,608 --> 00:58:18,365
<b>Doctor, everything in this world seems beautiful and kind to you, right?</b>

988
00:58:20,447 --> 00:58:24,480
<b>People who were raised by rich parents and had a good education</b>

989
00:58:24,484 --> 00:58:26,705
<b>will never understand me.</b>

990
00:58:27,087 --> 00:58:28,780
<b>I don't need you to understand me.</b>

991
00:58:28,788 --> 00:58:31,075
<b>And what's the point if you do?</b>

992
00:58:32,459 --> 00:58:35,415
<b>- Help me go to the restroom. - Okay.</b>

993
00:58:46,439 --> 00:58:48,195
<b>WOMEN'S TOILET</b>

994
00:58:54,848 --> 00:58:57,180
<b>Excuse me.</b>

995
00:58:57,183 --> 00:58:58,775
<b>Yes?</b>

996
00:59:06,493 --> 00:59:08,745
<b>- This is good. - Yes.</b>

997
00:59:14,501 --> 00:59:15,960
<b>Are there reporters outside?</b>

998
00:59:15,969 --> 00:59:17,395
<b>No.</b>

999
00:59:19,906 --> 00:59:21,165
<b>Mr. Jeong,</b>

1000
00:59:21,908 --> 00:59:25,810
<b>if there's a nurse outside, ask her to give me an IV drip or something.</b>

1001
00:59:25,812 --> 00:59:27,740
<b>It can be a vitamin IV drip or just saline.</b>

1002
00:59:27,747 --> 00:59:30,235
<b>People could barge in here out of the blue.</b>

1003
00:59:31,685 --> 00:59:36,745
<b>This person here told me not to let anyone inside.</b>

1004
00:59:36,990 --> 00:59:39,250
<b>I even got permission from the hospital director- -</b>

1005
00:59:39,259 --> 00:59:40,785
<b>Hey.</b>

1006
00:59:45,765 --> 00:59:47,860
<b>So this is how he addresses me.</b>

1007
00:59:47,867 --> 00:59:49,625
<b>My name</b>

1008
00:59:50,337 --> 00:59:51,925
<b>is this person.</b>

1009
00:59:53,807 --> 00:59:56,525
<b>You really can't address me properly?</b>

1010
00:59:56,876 --> 01:00:00,565
<b>Why don't you call me by my name, Tae- yeon?</b>

1011
01:00:01,181 --> 01:00:02,835
<b>I'll be outside.</b>

1012
01:00:02,849 --> 01:00:05,110
<b>And I'll tell the nurse that you want an IV drip.</b>

1013
01:00:05,118 --> 01:00:07,650
<b>- Okay. - Unbelievable.</b>

1014
01:00:07,654 --> 01:00:10,275
<b>Is he looking down on me?</b>

1015
01:00:10,924 --> 01:00:13,315
<b>I'll talk to him.</b>

1016
01:00:13,593 --> 01:00:16,060
<b>He’s new, so he doesn’t know how to act.</b>

1017
01:00:16,062 --> 01:00:18,960
<b>No, it’s because he knows exactly how to act.</b>

1018
01:00:18,965 --> 01:00:20,230
<b>When he started his job,</b>

1019
01:00:20,233 --> 01:00:23,030
<b>- it was obvious that I'm your wife. - Yes.</b>

1020
01:00:23,036 --> 01:00:26,725
<b>But from the first day he started, he's been looking at me suspiciously.</b>

1021
01:00:27,107 --> 01:00:31,965
<b>"I see. You're the mistress people talked about."</b>

1022
01:00:33,313 --> 01:00:35,705
<b>That's what he was saying with his eyes.</b>

1023
01:00:36,916 --> 01:00:38,975
<b>You can come back later.</b>

1024
01:00:44,090 --> 01:00:46,145
<b>What are you- -</b>

1025
01:00:47,394 --> 01:00:48,390
<b>You crazy bitch!</b>

1026
01:00:48,395 --> 01:00:49,720
<b>I should ask you that.</b>

1027
01:00:49,729 --> 01:00:51,230
<b>Are you out of your mind?</b>

1028
01:00:51,231 --> 01:00:53,330
<b>How dare you come here?</b>

1029
01:00:53,333 --> 01:00:56,325
<b>How dare you come to the hospital your son works?</b>

1030
01:00:56,670 --> 01:00:57,970
<b>Aren't you even embarrassed?</b>

1031
01:00:57,971 --> 01:00:59,525
<b>Or humiliated?</b>

1032
01:00:59,673 --> 01:01:02,270
<b>Did you come to the hospital your son works with your mistress</b>

1033
01:01:02,275 --> 01:01:04,610
<b>to show people that you're living such a wonderful life?</b>

1034
01:01:04,611 --> 01:01:06,910
<b>- Hey! - You be quiet.</b>

1035
01:01:06,913 --> 01:01:08,205
<b>Shut up.</b>

1036
01:01:08,915 --> 01:01:10,535
<b>Leave now.</b>

1037
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:13,110
<b>Stop humiliating my son.</b>

1038
01:01:13,119 --> 01:01:15,650
<b>Leave the hospital now, you asshole!</b>

1039
01:01:15,655 --> 01:01:17,150
<b>Mom, let's go.</b>

1040
01:01:17,157 --> 01:01:18,820
<b>Why did you come here?</b>

1041
01:01:18,825 --> 01:01:20,120
<b>Let's just go. Please?</b>

1042
01:01:20,126 --> 01:01:22,385
<b>Let go. Let go of me.</b>

1043
01:01:24,798 --> 01:01:27,485
<b>You want me to divorce you? Never.</b>

1044
01:01:28,168 --> 01:01:30,185
<b>Taking care of my health is hard enough,</b>

1045
01:01:30,670 --> 01:01:33,670
<b>so up until yesterday, I was going to divorce you.</b>

1046
01:01:33,673 --> 01:01:36,895
<b>But I'm disgusted by your behaviors,</b>

1047
01:01:37,077 --> 01:01:38,865
<b>so I will never divorce you.</b>

1048
01:01:39,179 --> 01:01:41,880
<b>Before you or I die,</b>

1049
01:01:41,881 --> 01:01:43,465
<b>I will not divorce you.</b>

1050
01:01:44,684 --> 01:01:48,645
<b>You, quit dreaming. You will be his cohabitant for the rest of his life.</b>

1051
01:01:48,822 --> 01:01:50,020
<b>And so will be your child.</b>

1052
01:01:50,023 --> 01:01:51,775
<b>Gosh.</b>

1053
01:02:01,367 --> 01:02:02,825
<b>Cottonoid.</b>

1054
01:02:17,317 --> 01:02:19,735
<b>Doctor, let's wake up the patient.</b>

1055
01:02:19,886 --> 01:02:21,275
<b>Okay.</b>

1056
01:02:31,464 --> 01:02:33,085
<b>ELAPSED TIME</b>

1057
01:02:36,035 --> 01:02:38,155
<b>Can you lift your arm?</b>

1058
01:02:39,439 --> 01:02:43,195
<b>Good job. All right. Squeeze my hand.</b>

1059
01:02:45,445 --> 01:02:47,095
<b>He squeezed my hand.</b>

1060
01:02:49,249 --> 01:02:51,475
<b>His facial muscles moved.</b>

1061
01:03:00,059 --> 01:03:01,290
<b>Let's do a language test now.</b>

1062
01:03:01,294 --> 01:03:02,615
<b>Okay.</b>

1063
01:03:03,363 --> 01:03:05,585
<b>How are you holding up? Are you all right?</b>

1064
01:03:05,765 --> 01:03:08,555
<b>Yes. I'm okay.</b>

<b>Sadang- dong, Dongjak- gu.</b>

1067

<b>Do you have any siblings?</b>

1068
01:03:22,148 --> 01:03:25,375
<b>I have a younger sister.</b>

1069

<b>You're doing great.</b>

1070

<b>What do you do? What's your job?</b>

1071
01:03:31,624 --> 01:03:33,290
<b>Well...</b>

1072
01:03:33,293 --> 01:03:34,790
<b>What do you do?</b>

1073
01:03:34,794 --> 01:03:36,745
<b>I...</b>

1074
01:03:46,239 --> 01:03:47,825
<b>Keep talking to him.</b>

1075
01:03:48,741 --> 01:03:50,895
<b>Hyeon- su, aren't you a police officer?</b>

1076
01:03:52,645 --> 01:03:55,635
<b>- Yes. - Why did you want to be a police officer?</b>

1077
01:03:57,584 --> 01:03:59,235
<b>It had been my dream</b>

01:04:06,693 --> 01:04:08,315
<b>I can't be one anymore</b>

1081

<b>because I had this surgery.</b>

1082
01:04:12,665 --> 01:04:16,130
<b>Hyeon- su, it's almost over. I'll wrap it up quickly.</b>

1083
01:04:16,135 --> 01:04:18,525
<b>Can you say a few more things?</b>

1084
01:04:18,671 --> 01:04:20,300
<b>You can go back to work.</b>

1085
01:04:20,306 --> 01:04:23,025
<b>Or you can take up another job. It's not too late.</b>

1086
01:04:24,010 --> 01:04:25,865
<b>I'm too old</b>

1087
01:04:26,613 --> 01:04:27,905
<b>to get another job.</b>

1088
01:04:31,317 --> 01:04:34,045
<b>When I was 29 years old,</b>

1089
01:04:34,721 --> 01:04:35,975
<b>I also got sick.</b>

1090
01:04:39,025 --> 01:04:41,690
<b>I suddenly got sick when I was 29,</b>

1091
01:04:41,694 --> 01:04:43,415
<b>so I left the military.</b>

1092
01:04:44,764 --> 01:04:46,955
<b>What was it?</b>

1093
01:04:47,834 --> 01:04:49,630
<b>What was your illness?</b>

1094
01:04:49,636 --> 01:04:54,165
<b>The ligament in the cervical spine stiffened like a bone.</b>

1095
01:04:54,407 --> 01:04:57,335
<b>It was paralyzed during my training.</b>

1096
01:04:58,044 --> 01:04:59,470
<b>What did you do?</b>

1097
01:04:59,479 --> 01:05:01,605
<b>What do you think?</b>

1098
01:05:01,714 --> 01:05:04,135
<b>I'm living a great life now.</b>

1099
01:05:06,319 --> 01:05:07,975
<b>Right.</b>

1100
01:05:09,522 --> 01:05:11,675
<b>You became a doctor.</b>

1101

<b>You can do it, too, Hyeon- su.</b>

1102
01:05:24,771 --> 01:05:28,495
<b>Hyeon- su, once you recover from the surgery,</b>

1103
01:05:28,908 --> 01:05:32,635
<b>you'll be able to start anything you want.</b>

1104

<b>You didn't take your medication yet.</b>

<b>Ms. Sin.</b>

01:07:43,876 --> 01:07:47,605
<b>Your husband made a huge decision by donating a piece of his liver.</b>

<b>It doesn't matter when he had the affair and why he decided to donate the liver.</b>

1142
01:07:57,890 --> 01:07:59,590
<b>What he did was incredible.</b>

1143

<b>He risked his life to donate a piece of his liver to you.</b>

<b>You should just</b>

<b>let your husband live his life without you.</b>

<b>You should live your own life now.</b>

<b>I got divorced because my wife cheated on me.</b>

1148
01:08:32,391 --> 01:08:33,860
<b>I worked at the hospital all day,</b>

1149
01:08:33,860 --> 01:08:37,045
<b>and looked after my son alone. I really lived hard, but...</b>

<b>She had an affair with her friend's husband.</b>

<b>At first,</b>

1152
01:08:45,471 --> 01:08:47,295
<b>it hurt my pride.</b>

1153

<b>And</b>

01:08:51,711 --> 01:08:53,810
<b>I was embarrassed to face other people.</b>

1155

<b>I wondered why my life was getting so difficult. It was really tough.</b>

<b>But all of a sudden, one day,</b>

<b>I realized how much time I was wasting.</b>

1158
01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:15,685
<b>Wasting my life away like this</b>

1159
01:09:16,469 --> 01:09:20,255
<b>because of what she did to me was doing a disservice to myself.</b>

<b>My goodness. You spent a long time being sick.</b>

1161

<b>It was so hard to get your health back.</b>

1162
01:09:36,522 --> 01:09:40,045
<b>For the sake of you, not your husband, please take the medication.</b>

1163
01:09:40,826 --> 01:09:42,785
<b>Give it your all</b>

<b>to make a full recovery.</b>

<b>Can you bring me a cup of water?</b>

<b>Thank you.</b>

<b>Thank you.</b>

1170
01:10:58,704 --> 01:11:00,200
<b>Who is it?</b>

01:11:11,183 --> 01:11:12,935
<b>Let's see.</b>

1175
01:11:14,553 --> 01:11:16,545
<b>The day when you bombed the EVD.</b>

1176
01:11:16,922 --> 01:11:18,345
<b>That's when I found out.</b>

1177
01:11:20,393 --> 01:11:22,385
<b>I checked your record.</b>

1178
01:11:23,062 --> 01:11:25,530
<b>You got discharged as a captain due to OPLL.</b>

1179
01:11:25,531 --> 01:11:27,955
<b>I saw it in your record, so I went digging.</b>

1180
01:11:28,734 --> 01:11:31,730
<b>You don't have any problems to live a normal life.</b>

1181
01:11:31,737 --> 01:11:35,795
<b>It's a treatable condition with medication or exercise when caught early in life.</b>

1182
01:11:35,941 --> 01:11:38,410
<b>However, that doesn't apply to sports or careers</b>

1183
01:11:38,411 --> 01:11:41,535
<b>that require you to move your body rigorously.</b>

1184
01:11:42,315 --> 01:11:46,535
<b>If you hurt your neck, it may lead to tetraplegia.</b>

1185
01:11:47,053 --> 01:11:49,805
<b>I really didn't have any problems with my condition so far.</b>

1186
01:11:51,490 --> 01:11:54,645
<b>Perhaps, it was because I was very nervous that day.</b>

1187
01:11:55,194 --> 01:11:58,015
<b>During the surgery, my legs went numb.</b>

1188
01:11:58,464 --> 01:12:00,855
<b>And I had a tingling sensation in my neck, too.</b>

1189
01:12:03,469 --> 01:12:05,895
<b>Feeling that pain all over again after several years</b>

1190
01:12:06,172 --> 01:12:07,640
<b>drove me crazy.</b>

1191
01:12:07,640 --> 01:12:09,340
<b>Why didn't you tell me?</b>

1192
01:12:09,342 --> 01:12:10,570
<b>It's not a serious condition.</b>

1193
01:12:10,576 --> 01:12:12,735
<b>I was going to tell you,</b>

1194
01:12:13,145 --> 01:12:15,205
<b>but I never had the right timing.</b>

1195
01:12:16,315 --> 01:12:18,675
<b>Also, it hurt my pride a bit</b>

1196
01:12:19,185 --> 01:12:21,205
<b>because everyone was so curious about it.</b>

1197
01:12:21,954 --> 01:12:24,405
<b>Where does that pride come from?</b>

1198
01:12:25,324 --> 01:12:27,090
<b>That's some pride you have.</b>

1199
01:12:27,093 --> 01:12:29,115
<b>Should I tell you my medical conditions?</b>

1200
01:12:32,298 --> 01:12:33,715
<b>Professor Chae.</b>

1201
01:12:34,333 --> 01:12:37,330
<b>Why didn't you say anything on the day of the surgery?</b>

1202
01:12:37,336 --> 01:12:40,100
<b>I told you I found out after the surgery.</b>

1203
01:12:40,106 --> 01:12:41,895
<b>I mean, I messed up a lot.</b>

1204
01:12:42,174 --> 01:12:44,695
<b>But you didn't say anything in the OR.</b>

1205
01:12:45,144 --> 01:12:46,635
<b>You didn't scold me either.</b>

1206
01:12:49,181 --> 01:12:51,105
<b>I have faith in you.</b>

1207
01:12:54,053 --> 01:12:56,475
<b>You are always diligent.</b>

1208
01:12:56,655 --> 01:12:58,620
<b>And you study and read up on the patients a lot.</b>

1209
01:12:58,624 --> 01:13:00,115
<b>So I couldn't understand it.</b>

1210
01:13:00,726 --> 01:13:03,145
<b>And I thought there must have been a reason for it.</b>

1211
01:13:04,463 --> 01:13:05,730
<b>So I decided to scold you later</b>

1212
01:13:05,731 --> 01:13:08,385
<b>and look into this first.</b>

1213
01:13:09,735 --> 01:13:12,370
<b>Why? Are you disappointed that I didn't scold you?</b>

1214
01:13:12,371 --> 01:13:13,655
<b>No.</b>

1215
01:13:16,909 --> 01:13:18,635
<b>If you</b>

1216
01:13:19,044 --> 01:13:21,480
<b>scolded me that day,</b>

1217
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:23,135
<b>I wouldn't have been here today.</b>

1218
01:13:28,854 --> 01:13:31,075
<b>You should have bought me some drinks, then.</b>

1219
01:13:31,424 --> 01:13:33,315
<b>I was going to.</b>

1220
01:13:35,027 --> 01:13:39,115
<b>When I went to the office to take you out, you had already left to get drinks.</b>

1221
01:13:41,066 --> 01:13:43,155
<b>Oh, right. Darn it.</b>

1222
01:13:43,836 --> 01:13:45,030
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

1223
01:13:45,037 --> 01:13:46,670
<b>I know that drinking with your colleagues</b>

1224
01:13:46,672 --> 01:13:49,465
<b>is more comfortable than with me.</b>

1225
01:13:50,176 --> 01:13:52,495
<b>Anyway, we'll settle that I bought you drinks.</b>

1226
01:13:54,180 --> 01:13:55,435
<b>Okay.</b>

1227
01:13:56,415 --> 01:14:00,035

<b>She'll be on call tonight for you.</b>

1230
01:14:12,364 --> 01:14:16,130
<b>She said you shouldn't think about anything else</b>

1231
01:14:16,135 --> 01:14:18,625
<b>and should just go drink a lot tonight.</b>

1232
01:14:21,273 --> 01:14:23,395
<b>My goodness.</b>

1233
01:14:23,876 --> 01:14:27,165
<b>And she told you not to get the wrong idea.</b>

1234
01:14:27,246 --> 01:14:29,735
<b>She said she doesn't have feelings for you.</b>

1235
01:14:31,650 --> 01:14:33,035
<b>What are you doing?</b>

1236
01:14:33,752 --> 01:14:35,245
<b>Go change now.</b>

1237
01:14:37,223 --> 01:14:38,645
<b>Okay.</b>

1238
01:14:44,930 --> 01:14:46,855
<b>Yes, I'm heading out, too.</b>

<b>Okay.</b>

1240
01:14:57,409 --> 01:14:58,640
<b>Is it an emergency patient?</b>

1241
01:14:58,644 --> 01:15:00,535
<b>Let's go. We'll talk on our way.</b>

1242
01:15:00,913 --> 01:15:03,935
<b>No, Professor Ahn. We don't have a patient.</b>

1243
01:15:08,187 --> 01:15:10,245

<b>Yes, this year is our tenth year together.</b>
