1
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:34,390
Hey, Parking Master!

2
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:40,610
Well... Can you park my bike for me?

3
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:42,650
Me? "Parking Master"?

4
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:45,910
Why did you turn around, then?
Come on. Take this.

5
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:47,820
Hey, get me some coffee!

6
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:49,990
I'll meet you in the lobby!

7
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,680
Hello, Professor. I'm sorry.

8
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:17,900
Don't be. I'm sorry for waking you up.

9
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:20,270
You have some time before the rounds.

10
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,150
-Get some more sleep.
-No, it's okay.

11
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:31,490
There you are.

12
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:33,410
Is this mine?

13
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,500
When did you get changed?

14
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:40,750
Hey, I can't come out to the lobby
dressed like that.

15
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,460
I also have to do my rounds,
so I went and took care of business

16
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,880
and got changed as fast as I could.

17
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:47,800
Is that so?

18
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:50,140
What you're thinking did not happen.

19
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:52,850
My anal sphincter is still strong.
Goodness.

20
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:54,350
What's this guy doing?

21
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:56,640
He's fast asleep.

22
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:59,100
Right, I'm exhausted every morning too.

23
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,190
Jeez, you scared me.

24
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:13,450
It's time you said goodbye to this world.

25
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:17,960
Leave everything you have behind

26
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,000
and come with me.

27
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,000
Now?

28
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,460
But I still have a lot to do.

29
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,260
Hey, wake up.

30
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:30,300
Dr. Yong, you're still alive.

31
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:32,180
-Hey, stop it.
-Seriously?

32
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,010
What the...

33
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:37,270
Dr. Yong, you must be really tired.

34
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:39,980
Have you taken a vacation yet?
You need some rest.

35
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,230
No, not yet.

36
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:46,030
-But I'm taking some time off next month.
-Good.

37
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:51,160
Professor Chae said we should all
take a vacation for a week,

38
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:54,700
so all the residents will take turns
and go on vacation.

39
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:58,200
If I could,
I'd love to take a week off as well.

40
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:02,420
If you had to take a year off
and not work, what would you do?

41
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,300
-Me?
-She'll probably want to study.

42
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:06,630
No.

43
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:11,010
I'd move to a place like Gangneung,
Sokcho, or Tongyeong.

44
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:13,600
I'd love to live somewhere like that
just for a year.

45
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:18,470
I want to live in a place that's not
too big or too small just for a year.

46
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,770
I'll work at a hospital there.

47
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:22,100
The question was,
"What would you do if you didn't work?"

48
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:23,860
It'd be more boring
if I don't work at all.

49
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:27,730
No, it wouldn't be boring.
There are so many things you can do.

50
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:29,780
-Okay, you can play all you want.
-I will!

51
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,410
Anyway, I'd prefer to work
at a small hospital

52
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:34,700
over a big hospital like this,

53
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:36,910
so I can give each patient
undivided attention.

54
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:40,960
There was an MBC documentary
called Success Tale.

55
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:42,330
Gosh, stop it.

56
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:45,080
If that show was still running,

57
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:47,210
they'd produce
a three-episode special feature on her.

58
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:52,430
In my free time, I'll go hiking,
go to the beach, and do fun things.

59
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:55,680
Hospitals in small towns are even busier.
"Free time"? Gosh, I doubt it.

60
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,010
What about you, Professor Lee?
What would you do?

61
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,180
Me?

62
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,140
I've never thought about it.

63
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:05,480
Should I assume I have a kid?

64
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,110
No, let’s say you’re single.

65
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:10,240
Clubbing! I'd go clubbing, of course.

66
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:13,820
I'll go to a club and dance all night.

67
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:18,330
I'll make sure my feet don't touch
the ground for over a second at a time.

68
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:20,120
-Like this.
-What about during the day?

69
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:22,580
I'll go shopping.

70
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:27,420
You see, I'm a city guy.
I love Seoul so much.

71
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,630
Seeing the stars and the moon
in the countryside isn't my thing.

72
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:33,930
The flashing neon signs in the city

73
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:37,970
Those things... How should I put this?
They heal my mind.

74
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:39,720
Aren't you taking flower photos recently?

75
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:41,520
There are flowers at shopping malls.

76
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:44,690
The apartment complexes
are surrounded by flowers.

77
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:49,820
I'd go to the flower shop
by the food court at the department store

78
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:53,320
and take pictures
of the neatly arranged flowers there.

79
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,990
Let's go. It's time for our rounds.

80
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:57,570
Come on. I have to do my rounds too.

81
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:00,870
The glamorous city

82
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:02,080
Gosh, be quiet.

83
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:22,180
I'll give you my answer
within the next 72 hours.

84
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:30,060
Is this some kind of a military
operation? You can take your time.

85
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:36,530
Then give me about a week.

86
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,660
All right. Don't skip meals.

87
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:46,210
Of course!
I eat two bowls of rice for every meal.

88
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:49,630
I'm sorry, Mom.
The baby's condition suddenly worsened.

89
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,540
I have to go to the PICU now.

90
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:54,760
You can go and get
the health checkup done by yourself.

91
00:05:56,470 --> 00:06:00,300
Mom, the gastroscopy
will be done last anyway.

92
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:03,260
I should be able to make it there by then.

93
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:08,350
Of course, I can get it done by myself.
Am I a kid?

94
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:11,560
But I was told to bring a guardian
for the conscious sedation endoscope.

95
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:13,610
Gosh, what a nuisance.

96
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:15,360
So people who are single
and have no friends

97
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,360
can't even get it done or what?

98
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:21,740
I know that too. That's why I left the car
and took a taxi here. Anyway...

99
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:24,040
-Excuse me.
-Yes.

100
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:26,700
Where do I go for a health checkup?

101
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:29,420
Go to B1 of the next building.

102
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,630
You can either go outside
and find that building

103
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:34,090
or just head down to B1 from here.
It's all connected.

104
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:36,170
My gosh, you're so kind.

105
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,050
-Thank you.
-No problem.

106
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,760
Whatever. I don't need you.

107
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,720
I'll figure out what to do with
this damn endoscopy, so just do your work.

108
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:45,890
I have to go.

109
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,310
Hey, Jun-wan. Are you seeing someone?

110
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:57,570
You are. Talk to you later.

111
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,740
That prick, is he a psychic?

112
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:12,670
This morning, his temperature went up
to 37.8°C, so we gave him a fever reducer.

113
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:14,130
The fever has gone down.

114
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:18,670
I saw the chest X-ray you took
this morning.

115
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:22,550
Your lungs are still tight.
That's probably why you had a fever.

116
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,930
It's not easy, but you have
to keep doing the ball exercise.

117
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:31,310
I feel so weak
because all I eat is porridge.

118
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,520
You'll get rice starting tomorrow.

119
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,940
We'll give him normal meals
starting tomorrow.

120
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,020
Okay.

121
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:39,110
Can I eat meat?

122
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:41,780
I have a huge craving for bulgogi.

123
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,160
Gosh, even now...

124
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:49,250
I feel like I can smell bulgogi right now.

125
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:53,170
The Seoul-style bulgogi, right?

126
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:55,380
With the sweet marinade.

127
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:58,550
With a ton of green onions.

128
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:01,800
Two tablespoons of minced garlic.

129
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:05,930
A little bit of corn syrup and plenty of
enoki and shiitake mushrooms, right?

130
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:08,390
I can smell...

131
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:17,480
Ma'am! You can't give him that.
He's supposed to be fasting now.

132
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:20,780
Gosh, please. My goodness.

133
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:24,070
Your surgery is tomorrow.
You really shouldn't be eating this, sir.

134
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:26,160
Gosh, Doctor.

135
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:31,290
It's major surgery
where his abdomen will be split open.

136
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:33,330
He can't go in for the surgery
on an empty stomach.

137
00:08:34,170 --> 00:08:37,420
He needs to eat at least one proper meal

138
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,840
for the surgery to go well. Right, Doctor?

139
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:44,050
No. That's not how it works, ma'am. Gosh.

140
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:48,930
Sir, you can eat as much as you want
after the surgery.

141
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:52,230
If you eat this now,
you'll have to fast one more day.

142
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:54,190
Just restrain yourself for today,

143
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:57,650
and you can eat all sorts of yummy foods
until you turn 100. I promise, okay?

144
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:01,230
-Great. I'll put this in the fridge.
-Gosh, all right.

145
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,650
Thank goodness you caught that,
Professor Lee.

146
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:06,610
He's getting his surgery tomorrow.

147
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,870
Doctor, wait! Doctor.

148
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:13,290
Take this.

149
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,710
My grandson bought it.

150
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:20,250
My gosh, it's sweet and tasty.
It's so good.

151
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:24,800
Ma'am, we can't accept things like this.

152
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,380
This could get us in trouble.

153
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:29,760
Gosh, it's just coffee though.
You really can't accept it?

154
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:32,600
You see, I just...

155
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:36,020
I feel bad
for causing such a nuisance today.

156
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:39,560
That's very sweet of you.
The gesture is more than enough.

157
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:40,860
I'll take it.

158
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:42,690
Thank you.

159
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:46,860
My gosh, it looks delicious.

160
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:50,740
Ma'am, I'll accept it this time,
but don't give me anything from now on.

161
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:54,080
Sure thing. You won't get anything from me
from now on.

162
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:57,080
Enjoy the coffee.

163
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,040
-Thank you for this.
-My pleasure.

164
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:03,380
Ms. Song! Let's go to the VIP ward.

165
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:07,970
Ms. Song and I will go check up
on Mr. Go Yeong-min in the VIP ward.

166
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:10,010
Wait.

167
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:11,760
What?

168
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,390
You can come too.

169
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:20,190
Let's go.

170
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,780
-Your kid dropped out of school?
-Yes.

171
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:27,070
The kid really can't stand school.

172
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,990
If the kid doesn't want to go,
you can't really do anything.

173
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:31,160
I mean, what can you do?

174
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:33,030
-Eighth grade, right?
-Yes.

175
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,200
Gosh.

176
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:37,410
I said, "You have
to at least finish middle school."

177
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,540
-But the kid wants to take the GED test.
-What?

178
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:42,420
The kid will work part-time
and buy a camera and a computer.

179
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:45,170
And the kid told me
to mind my own business.

180
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:49,220
Sometimes I feel like my kid is an alien.

181
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,350
Hello. My gosh.

182
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:57,480
I guess you came here
right after your shoot.

183
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,980
Yes, hello.

184
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:02,440
I was up all night because of the shoot.
I got here a few hours ago.

185
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:06,320
I didn't have a chance
to remove my makeup though.

186
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:09,490
Is your father asleep?

187
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:11,570
Yes, he just fell asleep.

188
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,580
-Hello.
-Yes, hello.

189
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:16,370
My gosh.

190
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:20,500
Even for simple surgery,
the next day is always the hardest.

191
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,670
After today, it'll be much easier,

192
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,750
so please tell him to hang in there.

193
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:27,300
He actually watched TV with me
until he fell asleep.

194
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:29,720
He doesn't feel any pain or discomfort.
He feels great.

195
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:36,390
Well, I should buy you a meal sometime.

196
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:37,720
Sure.

197
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,270
Then how about lunch today?

198
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:42,810
Sounds good.

199
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,820
How are the total bilirubin
and LFT levels?

200
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:54,320
The total bilirubin level is 25,
and LFT is 700 over 400,

201
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:55,950
but it keeps going up.

202
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,870
-Still no word from the KONOS?
-No.

203
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:06,040
I don't think she can hold out
for more than a week.

204
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,300
Gosh.

205
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:13,180
Ji-a's mother is outside, right?

206
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:16,550
Yes, she is. But she's devastated.

207
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:22,560
I explained everything to her.
Often, and in detail.

208
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:25,980
Not like the last time. I wasn't blunt.

209
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,570
Thanks.

210
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:31,360
I'll tell her

211
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:34,280
that Ji-a might have a hard time.

212
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:15,650
You're a big eater now.

213
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:21,120
Back then,
I only ate one meal every two days.

214
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:23,410
-It must've been tough for you.
-Yes.

215
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:25,620
Sorry.

216
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:32,250
Well, is that why you broke up with me?

217
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,630
Me? I didn't say I want
to break up with you.

218
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,300
-Did I say it first?
-Yes.

219
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:41,220
You said you were stressed and tired.
You wanted a break.

220
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:42,930
Then you were off the grid.

221
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:47,600
I did. But when I called you
after a little while,

222
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,610
you ignored my calls.

223
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:52,690
-I called you about 30 times.
-No, you called 29 times.

224
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,740
Good for you. You have a good memory.

225
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:57,070
I totally made that up.

226
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,450
-Hello, I'm a fan of yours.
-Oh...

227
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:06,040
-Hello, enjoy your lunch.
-Thank you.

228
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:13,380
Are you uncomfortable here?
We should've eaten out.

229
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:16,590
Yes, I said I'd take you
to a nice restaurant.

230
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:19,760
Gosh, don't you know about
the Improper Solicitation and Graft Act?

231
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:22,390
-Hello, Professor Lee.
-Hello, Professor Lee.

232
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:28,980
Aren't you...

233
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:31,860
Yes. She's the person who you think
she is, but she's eating right now.

234
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:33,070
Go away, guys.

235
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,230
-Enjoy your lunch.
-Thank you.

236
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,740
-Enjoy your lunch.
-Thank you.

237
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:45,620
Would you like anything else?
This kongguksu is good too.

238
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:49,290
My, look who's here. I'm a fan of yours.

239
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,790
Gosh, these pricks.
Can you please let her eat--

240
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:55,460
My gosh.

241
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:57,130
Hello, sir.

242
00:14:57,210 --> 00:14:59,430
Is everything fine, my good sir?

243
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:02,390
-He's the chairman of the hospital board.
-Oh, hello.

244
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:04,810
My gosh, you don't need to get up. Please.

245
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:07,140
You look much prettier in person.

246
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:09,060
My goodness.

247
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:10,480
Are you a doll?

248
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:12,100
Gosh, no.

249
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:15,570
What brings you by?

250
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:17,070
-Are you not feeling well?
-I'm fine.

251
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,110
I came for a checkup.

252
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:21,200
-Is she your patient?
-Well...

253
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:24,410
I performed surgery
on her father yesterday.

254
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:27,370
Can I take a picture with you?

255
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:29,620
-Sure.
-Let's take a selfie together.

256
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:31,960
Sure, I can take it.

257
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:35,380
Hey, I want to be in the picture too.

258
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:37,590
All right.

259
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:39,920
Here we go.

260
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:48,430
Oh, I was recording a video.
Sorry about that.

261
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:52,440
-Shall I take a picture of all of you?
-No, it's okay. I got this.

262
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:55,480
All right, let's try it again.
Look at the camera.

263
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:02,490
-What are you doing?
-Here. Let's do this.

264
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,330
-Hey.
-This is...

265
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:11,040
Hey, you take it. Goodness.

266
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:12,670
-All right, then.
-Okay, guys.

267
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,210
I'll take it now. One, two, three.

268
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:24,390
You're too stubborn.

269
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:27,220
That was embarrassing,
in front of all those people.

270
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,310
What was I supposed to do?
I can't see very well.

271
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:31,730
Hand me your car keys.
I'll drive you home.

272
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:33,730
People become more stubborn as they age.

273
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:35,980
-No wonder youngsters don't like you.
-Come on now.

274
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:38,860
I'm still young at heart.

275
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:40,690
Age is nothing but a number.

276
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:44,110
You need to be youthful physically.
How you feel doesn't matter at all.

277
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,660
Jeez, give me that.

278
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,580
Maybe the battery is dead.

279
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:53,000
Are you sure it's on this floor?

280
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,830
I always park here...

281
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:08,550
I told you.
How you feel doesn't matter at all.

282
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:13,640
Let's move into a nursing home, Jong-su.

283
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:16,100
Do you know of a good one?
Frankly, I'd like that.

284
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:18,400
But first, let's find your car.
Give me that.

285
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:21,030
I took a taxi here today.

286
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:33,250
-Goodness.
-I took a taxi.

287
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,920
-Oh, dear.
-You think it's funny?

288
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,050
Yes, I have to laugh.

289
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:44,420
Goodness. You're too much.

290
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:47,800
Gosh. I get that you were
all over the place today, but how...

291
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:50,430
-Oh, boy.
-I took a taxi here.

292
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,650
MOM

293
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:14,500
Hi, Son. Did you have lunch?

294
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:17,210
No, not yet. I'm going to have lunch now.

295
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:20,880
What's with your voice, Mom?
Do you have a cold?

296
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:24,050
They say even dogs don't catch a cold
in the middle of summer,

297
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:27,170
yet I caught a cold. Poor me.

298
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:30,090
I'm okay though. I took some medicine.

299
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,180
What is it? Did something happen?

300
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:34,010
Oh... No.

301
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:37,100
I'll go to Aunt's place after work.

302
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,730
Yes.

303
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:42,060
I'll head over there now
and eat something.

304
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:43,650
I'll see you later.

305
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:51,910
When did you get here?

306
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:58,290
What's wrong?
Is your patient not doing well?

307
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:00,790
It's a six-month-old baby.

308
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:04,040
We performed the Kasai procedure
three months ago for her biliary atresia.

309
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:05,670
And?

310
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,920
Her condition seemed to be improving
after the surgery,

311
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:11,260
but her hepatocirrhosis
is quite serious now.

312
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:14,930
A liver transplant
would be the only solution.

313
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:18,560
But her mom's blood type isn't compatible,
and her dad has hepatitis B.

314
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,810
Have you registered her yet?

315
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:24,110
It won't be easy to find a donor
as she's a baby.

316
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:27,440
Yes, I already did.
But I haven't heard from them yet.

317
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:31,860
She's an infant, so a brain-dead donor
must be under the age of 40.

318
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:33,660
And the liver can't be too large.

319
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:36,490
It's honestly so difficult.

320
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:42,540
Her parents seem exhausted.

321
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:44,460
I think they've almost given up.

322
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,630
I can't give up though.

323
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:49,970
Oh, boy.

324
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,890
But you should try everything you can do.

325
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:56,310
Let's go.

326
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:00,350
-Let's go eat something.
-I don't have an appetite.

327
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:10,190
What? A hinoki bathtub?
Why do you need it?

328
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:14,410
Seong-beom who lives next door
got one for his mom?

329
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:16,870
What? Thirty million won?

330
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:22,120
Mom, your son is not rich.
I live paycheck to paycheck.

331
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:23,750
Gosh, seriously!

332
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:26,920
I already spoke to my friend
who's an ENT doctor.

333
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:29,300
Come to the hospital next week.
I'll go with you.

334
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:33,260
You need to get good-quality hearing aids
that fit well.

335
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:37,100
Gosh, I chose a cheap one.

336
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,640
Yes, seriously. It was very cheap.

337
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:43,600
Okay.

338
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,600
Jeong-yeon changed what?

339
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,150
She changed her name? To what?

340
00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:51,530
Mom.

341
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:54,530
If she's still only getting minor roles
after 15 years,

342
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:56,070
it means she doesn't have talent.

343
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:59,620
Tell her to quit and learn
a practical skill or prepare for an exam.

344
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:02,160
I'll talk to her.

345
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,330
Okay, I'll call her.

346
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:06,960
-Jeong-yeon changed her name?
-Yes.

347
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:09,500
She's Yeon-jeong now.

348
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,260
-That's a pretty name.
-Pretty, my ass.

349
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:15,180
What a joke.
It sounds like a Chinese restaurant.

350
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:16,090
My gosh.

351
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:19,050
-She's so immature.
-You ordered eggs, right?

352
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:24,140
Your eggs are here. They're fresh and big.

353
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:26,560
You haven't eaten yet, right? I knew it.

354
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:28,360
Here, the lady at the cafeteria
gave me this.

355
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,320
-They're boiled eggs, right?
-Obviously.

356
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:33,900
Professor Chae, the flash drive. Hello.

357
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:36,070
-Yes, I'll take it.
-Here you go.

358
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:38,660
My brother, good to see you.

359
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:40,410
A younger sister's husband
is a brother-in-law.

360
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:42,120
Gosh, no.

361
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,160
Brother-in-law, have a seat here.

362
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:46,000
Are you busy? Sit down for a minute.

363
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,670
-I can't. I have to do something.
-Song-hwa.

364
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,670
Is he that busy?
Are you making him work like a dog?

365
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:55,010
Join us and have some food.

366
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:59,930
Yes, have a seat.
I have something to tell you.

367
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:00,930
Okay.

368
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:07,230
Well...

369
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:09,770
You know that you're the first, right?

370
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:12,730
-What do you mean?
-I'm talking about Ik-sun.

371
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:15,650
She's actually quite popular.

372
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,410
When you meet her,

373
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:20,530
you realize that she's funnier
than you thought.

374
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:23,620
Yes, you're right. She's really funny.

375
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,330
I know that very well.

376
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,830
Especially, the pigeon...

377
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:29,960
Right, the pigeon.

378
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:33,340
You must've seen it many times.
I taught her that.

379
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:35,050
You see, I...

380
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:37,510
This is what I do. The pigeon...

381
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:40,760
It flies like this.

382
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,730
Then it comes back like this.

383
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:48,850
I've been seeing that for 20 years.

384
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:51,060
-Gosh, I'm sick of it.
-I've seen his and his sister's.

385
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:53,900
That's why she's had so many guys
confess their feelings to her.

386
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:56,150
I'm telling you. Ik-sun has had

387
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:59,150
countless guys chase her.

388
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:02,820
Yes, Ik-sun is popular
in the unit as well.

389
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:03,740
Right?

390
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:06,750
She's used to having guys
confess their feelings to her.

391
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:10,500
This is my first time seeing her
being so obvious about liking a guy.

392
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:12,580
Me?

393
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:15,800
Gosh, it's not me.
We don't have that kind of relationship.

394
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:19,050
Seriously, we're just close friends.
She's my best friend.

395
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:21,640
-Really.
-That's how it begins, you know.

396
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:24,890
Soon, you guys will call each other
"babe" or "honey."

397
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:27,560
Professor Lee, we're really just friends.

398
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:29,060
You see, my sister...

399
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,110
She's so used to receiving love.

400
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,650
She's never liked a guy first.

401
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:39,360
Even if she had a crush on someone,
she never showed it.

402
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:41,030
But I think

403
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:44,490
my sister likes you.

404
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:47,990
Dr. Ahn.

405
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,370
I hope

406
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:55,210
you'll accept my sister's love.

407
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:05,050
Are you all right? That must've hurt.

408
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:10,640
-Why did you hit me? What the hell?
-Hey.

409
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:12,100
-Why--
-You prick.

410
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:13,230
-Hey, guys.
-What? Why?

411
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:14,440
-I didn't do anything.
-Stop.

412
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,270
-Who do you think you are?
-How embarrassing.

413
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:18,610
-What's your problem?
-Guys, enough!

414
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:20,530
Hey, what the hell?

415
00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:22,280
I brought those eggs.

416
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,910
-How dare you smack my head--
-Seriously!

417
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:38,840
I thought
you guys were seven-year-old boys.

418
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:41,670
Why did you use his head to crack the egg?

419
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,550
Because Ik-jun kept talking nonsense.

420
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:45,300
Why is that nonsense?

421
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,760
I've never seen a guy
who knows so much about his sister.

422
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:51,430
He was talking about himself,
not his sister.

423
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:53,390
That's how he's always been.

424
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:56,270
Have you ever seen Ik-jun
fall for a girl first?

425
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:58,940
He married Hye-jeong
because she chased him for months.

426
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:02,070
He and his sister
are driving me nuts these days.

427
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:04,700
I'm leaving.

428
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,370
You won't stay for coffee?

429
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:09,370
I have to go see Mr. Instinct.

430
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:12,790
I have a gift for him.

431
00:25:14,290 --> 00:25:15,540
Bye.

432
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:22,880
Have you seen Mr. Instinct?

433
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,380
"Mr. Instinct"?

434
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:26,930
Dr. Do stepped out to get coffee.

435
00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:28,430
-Should I call him?
-No, no need.

436
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:31,770
He's never around
when I'm trying to be nice.

437
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:33,230
Why, Professor?

438
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:36,310
I was going to ask him
to take care of an ASD next week.

439
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:39,150
-Shall I call him?
-No, I can call him.

440
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,780
I was going to tell him nonchalantly
and surprise him.

441
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:45,070
I heard he comes here often,
so I came to find him.

442
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:48,320
Too bad. I suppose this is his fate.

443
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,620
Take it easy, guys.

444
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:02,340
What brings you here?

445
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:04,760
Is this Dr. Bong's salon,
where I can find out

446
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:07,130
everything about the professors
from their first love

447
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:09,180
to their health problems?

448
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:11,430
That's correct.
About Professor Kim Jun-wan?

449
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:12,390
Correct.

450
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:15,230
I love Professor Kim very much.

451
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:17,190
I want to know more about him.
What should I do?

452
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:19,230
Gosh, I'm so curious.

453
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:23,780
Dr. Ahn, I'm really jealous.

454
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:26,360
Professor Chae is like Mother Teresa.

455
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,450
Yes, she's great.

456
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:30,910
Dr. Ahn, you really don't look like
a military guy.

457
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:32,740
Are you sure
you're from the Military Academy?

458
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:34,830
Yes, I did pretty well in the military.

459
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:36,330
Then why did you leave?

460
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:38,920
You got into Korea Military Academy
and became a captain.

461
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,080
Why did you quit?

462
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:42,590
Rumor has it
that it was because of a woman.

463
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:44,840
I heard he quit because
he lacks the aptitude for it.

464
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:48,130
There was a big accident in his unit.
He quit because of his PTSD.

465
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:50,550
-I'm sure a woman was involved.
-He lacks the aptitude.

466
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,760
He obviously didn't follow
the MBTI test results.

467
00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:54,890
It was because
of his post-traumatic stress disorder.

468
00:26:54,970 --> 00:26:56,430
It can be very stressful.

469
00:26:56,980 --> 00:27:00,600
Wouldn't it be more comfortable for you
to talk about this when I'm not around?

470
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:04,520
No, we never talk behind anyone's back.
We say it in front of them.

471
00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:08,950
Dr. Ahn, you won't tell us anyway. Right?

472
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:13,370
Forget it. It's not like we're curious.

473
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:15,580
-All right.
-Also, the past isn't important.

474
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:17,250
The future is what matters.

475
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:18,620
Professor.

476
00:27:19,290 --> 00:27:21,830
What does Professor Kim Jun-wan
like the most?

477
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:25,500
I've been observing him
for half a year and...

478
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,050
And?

479
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:29,260
I think he likes everyone but me.

480
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:31,590
He doesn't open up easily.

481
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:35,220
He has no interest in other people.
He's a selfish guy.

482
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:39,390
Oh, there is this one thing.
Golf. He loves golf.

483
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:42,520
He'd even go golfing
with his parents' worst enemy.

484
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,840
As for Jeong-won, he's from a rich family,

485
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:10,300
so he's dabbled in all sorts of things.

486
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:12,300
He has a different hobby for each season.

487
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:13,680
-In spring--
-He runs a marathon.

488
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:16,050
That's right.
He runs a marathon in spring.

489
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,810
In summer, he goes surfing.

490
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:22,270
In autumn, he goes hiking.
Then in winter, he goes skiing.

491
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:25,270
But he can't do any of that these days
because he's busy.

492
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,440
What about Professor Yang?

493
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:29,940
Seok-hyeong? Does he have a hobby?

494
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:32,320
I think he's always home.

495
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:36,570
Rumor has it that he has a 300-inch TV.

496
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:38,160
Jeez.

497
00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:40,910
Song-hwa's only hobby is going camping.

498
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:07,310
As for Ik-jun...

499
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:10,150
That prick is...

500
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:12,570
He does everything.

501
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:17,910
He bikes, golfs,
and also likes video games.

502
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:20,660
He can play the guitar
as well as the bass guitar.

503
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:24,620
He even wrote a cheer song
for a baseball team. Also, he can cook.

504
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:29,000
Anyway, he does everything.
And he's good at all of them.

505
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:32,010
-He can cook?
-He sure can.

506
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:35,130
You know
he's been a single father for a few years.

507
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:39,180
He's adamant about giving U-ju
only organic, home-cooked meals at home,

508
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:42,720
so he always cooks and eats
with his son on weekends.

509
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:09,250
Does it need more vinegar?

510
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:38,820
Hands up.

511
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:42,490
Are Ma-ne and her dad the only ones
coming this evening?

512
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:45,080
-It's Mo-ne.
-Right, Mo-ne.

513
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:48,750
Does Mo-ne not have a sister?

514
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:50,500
I'm sure she does. One called Ma-ne.

515
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:53,420
She has an older sister, Jang Ma-ne.
They're twins.

516
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:56,260
See? I knew it.

517
00:30:57,590 --> 00:30:59,300
Ma-ne and Mo-ne always go as a set.

518
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,140
Is Ma-ne not coming today?

519
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:04,970
I don't know. I like Mo-ne.

520
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:06,270
Here you go.

521
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,060
When it comes to love, you never know.

522
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,400
I made meatballs.

523
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,440
-I even made ketchup from scratch.
-I want jajangmyeon!

524
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:18,400
Hey, come on.

525
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:31,790
What's your name?

526
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:34,090
"Brachyscome angustifolia."

527
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:37,050
It blooms all year round?

528
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:40,970
Your life must be exhausting.

529
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,730
"Geranium"?

530
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:53,860
I've heard of "plutonium"

531
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:57,940
and "uranium,"
but I've never heard of "geranium."

532
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:00,400
Anyway, nice to meet you.

533
00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:03,200
Shouldn't you go to the hospital?

534
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:07,120
Gosh, I'm sick of that place.

535
00:32:07,870 --> 00:32:12,000
If I fall ill, I'll just quietly move
into a temple somewhere.

536
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:17,380
Oh, another flower I've never seen before.

537
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:20,010
Hold on. What is your name?

538
00:32:20,090 --> 00:32:22,090
Jong-su, try taking a picture of me.

539
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:26,300
Come on.

540
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:39,730
-What does it say?
-What?

541
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:42,950
Oh, it found a name.

542
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:44,360
-Really?
-Yes.

543
00:32:45,370 --> 00:32:46,740
The name is...

544
00:32:47,370 --> 00:32:49,540
"Your Youth Is Gone."

545
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:50,790
What?

546
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:54,120
It says your youth is gone.

547
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:57,040
For real? Let me see.

548
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,090
Show me.

549
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:01,920
Come on. Show me!

550
00:33:02,010 --> 00:33:03,630
Gosh, no need. What's there to see?

551
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,260
-Hey!
-Goodness.

552
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:08,180
-Gosh, seriously.
-Ouch. Let's go inside.

553
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:10,810
-It's cold. Come on!
-What are you talking about? It's summer.

554
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:13,890
-Gosh, it's so cold.
-Hey, show me. Does it really say that?

555
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:15,020
Hey!

556
00:33:18,150 --> 00:33:20,070
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

557
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:34,330
You look good.
You're young, so you always look pretty.

558
00:33:35,370 --> 00:33:37,880
Oh, you look a little tired today.

559
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:41,210
-Menstrual cramps. I get it every month.
-Oh, no.

560
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:45,430
-I have a question.
-Fire away.

561
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:49,140
Is that the only outfit you have?

562
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:51,140
Yes, this is my summer outfit.

563
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:58,400
What? What are you doing?

564
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:01,320
I can see my reflection on your face.

565
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,980
This is called dewy makeup.

566
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:04,320
It's too much.

567
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:10,240
My mom said fashion that others
don't recognize can't be called fashion.

568
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:14,250
My mom said I should tell my friends
right away when they go the wrong way.

569
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
What the heck?

570
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:32,060
We'll begin the ASD closure
for patient Jeong Jin-ho.

571
00:34:32,890 --> 00:34:36,520
Lead surgeon Do Jae-hak.
First assistant Kim Jun-wan.

572
00:34:36,890 --> 00:34:39,230
Please begin, Dr. Do.

573
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:41,190
Okay.

574
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,170
Don't cut that part.

575
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,970
Be very precise,
or you'll damage other parts.

576
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:10,220
Got it.

577
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:24,150
Again, be precise.
Go down to the endocardium.

578
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:28,570
If you only stitch up the outer layers
that are on sight, it'll bleed later.

579
00:35:28,650 --> 00:35:29,650
Understood, Doctor.

580
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,820
For that part, don't go too deep.

581
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:35,910
Don't fool your eyes. Look and be precise.

582
00:35:36,490 --> 00:35:37,750
Okay.

583
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:42,250
Dr. Do.

584
00:35:42,330 --> 00:35:45,460
I got a call from the ICU,
so I can't finish this up.

585
00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:48,420
Can I go?

586
00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:50,590
Yes, get going. Thanks for your help.

587
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:53,390
All right, thank you.

588
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,180
Professor.

589
00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:03,060
Thank you for this opportunity.

590
00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:05,480
I'll do better next time.

591
00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:07,230
Okay, do better next time.

592
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:13,320
Hey.

593
00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:17,580
You actually did better than I thought.
What's gotten into you?

594
00:36:33,010 --> 00:36:34,470
-Hello.
-Hello.

595
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:35,970
Pass me my phone.

596
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,470
-Are you guys med students?
-Yes.

597
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,520
Where do you live?

598
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,730
I live pretty far.
It takes 50 minutes by subway.

599
00:36:44,810 --> 00:36:47,060
My gosh, that must be tiring.

600
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,440
-All right, take it easy.
-Have a nice day, sir.

601
00:37:00,490 --> 00:37:01,540
-Hello.
-Hello.

602
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:03,000
Dr. Jang Gyeo-ul.

603
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:05,210
She's in the OR.

604
00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:07,460
Oh, really? Thanks.

605
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:09,840
Med students, right?

606
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,260
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

607
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:12,670
What does your father do?

608
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:15,260
-He's a farmer.
-I see.

609
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:19,350
Have a good day, sir.

610
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:26,310
Professor.

611
00:37:26,810 --> 00:37:29,900
Ji-a's hourly urine output
is less than 3cc.

612
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:32,360
-What about her vitals?
-Her BP is okay,

613
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:34,820
but her heart rate is around 150bpm.
She has tachycardia.

614
00:37:38,370 --> 00:37:40,410
Professor, we're ready.

615
00:37:40,490 --> 00:37:41,790
Okay, I'm coming.

616
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:44,830
It's an imperforate anus surgery,
so I'll finish in two hours.

617
00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:47,330
Give her more fluid
and keep me updated, please.

618
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:52,090
Call Professor Lee Ji-yeong
if she gets worse. I'll let her know.

619
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:53,460
Okay.

620
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:08,560
-Hello.
-Hi, who are you?

621
00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:09,730
I'm a med student.

622
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:12,900
Why did you choose to go to med school?
It's a hard path.

623
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:14,860
-Is there a doctor in your family?
-No.

624
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:18,280
-What does your father do?
-He's a farmer.

625
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,530
I see. Farming is great.

626
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,620
No, the surgery wasn't that hard.

627
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:30,840
It was for a condition called "ASD,"
an atrial septal defect.

628
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,670
I do it all the time.

629
00:38:35,090 --> 00:38:37,430
Yes, I got it done in no time.

630
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,470
Why would I get yelled at?

631
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:47,850
Professor Kim doesn't lose his temper
for no reason.

632
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:51,110
Honey, I'll call you back.

633
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:54,780
-Where are you going?
-Not telling you. Was that your wife?

634
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:56,860
Yes, I bragged about my first surgery.

635
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:58,700
I'm envious that you have a wife.

636
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:00,700
Professor, I signed a long-term lease.

637
00:39:00,990 --> 00:39:03,200
No more monthly rent!
The deposit is 200 million won.

638
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,950
I'll invite you to our housewarming party.

639
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,750
Did you check everything thoroughly?
There are a lot of rental scams.

640
00:39:07,830 --> 00:39:10,880
It's me who took the college entry exam
four times, and the bar exam six times.

641
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:13,630
Long-term leases are rare these days,

642
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:16,010
so I was wondering if I should
just extend my monthly lease.

643
00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:19,010
But it was one of my realtor's listings,
so I signed it right away.

644
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:21,590
In other words,
my realtor will be my landlord.

645
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,890
So everything was very easy.
I signed it immediately.

646
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:29,310
Hey, realtors can be scammers too.

647
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:33,190
I checked a certified copy of the register
as well as his ID.

648
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:35,110
-You should be careful.
-Of what?

649
00:39:35,730 --> 00:39:37,360
Professor Cheon Myeong-tae.

650
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:41,030
I've heard bad rumors about him.
Stay away from him.

651
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:42,280
"Bad rumors"? Like what?

652
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:45,580
-It's kind of gross.
-Gosh, enough. I don't want to hear it.

653
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:48,620
Be it cheating, gambling, or stealing.
I don't care what he does.

654
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:50,500
Get back to work.
Stop following me around.

655
00:39:51,330 --> 00:39:54,040
-Oh, Professor.
-What? What now?

656
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:56,750
You're seeing someone, right?

657
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,680
You're literally glued to your phone.

658
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:06,640
And if she takes this long
to get back to you,

659
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,270
it's safe to assume that she dumped you.

660
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:27,620
-Hello.
-Hello.

661
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:31,250
Hi, guys. Are you two
the famous Hong-do and Yun-bok?

662
00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:34,540
-Yes, I'm Jang Yun-bok.
-I'm Jang Hong-do.

663
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:37,630
We've met before. I gave you a lot of
sausages at the cafeteria that day.

664
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:40,090
No way. That was him?

665
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:41,720
The chatty cafeteria guy?

666
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:42,880
Be quiet.

667
00:40:42,970 --> 00:40:44,090
Hey.

668
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:45,590
Yes?

669
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:48,930
What songs do kids listen to these days?

670
00:40:49,890 --> 00:40:51,850
-Pardon?
-I'm talking about music.

671
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:54,730
Tell me the kind of songs
you listen to these days.

672
00:40:55,310 --> 00:40:56,610
IU's songs.

673
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:59,650
Well, I listen to...

674
00:41:01,070 --> 00:41:02,490
Zoo's songs.

675
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:07,990
Hold on. Are you talking
about the band that I like?

676
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:09,910
How do you know that band?

677
00:41:09,990 --> 00:41:12,290
She always listens to old songs.

678
00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:13,290
She's so lame.

679
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:15,250
No, she's not.
What's lame about old songs?

680
00:41:15,330 --> 00:41:17,290
-You're lamer.
-No, they are lame.

681
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:18,750
He doesn't get romance.

682
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:21,130
I can see that.
Hey, don't hang out with him.

683
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,010
You know nothing...

684
00:41:23,970 --> 00:41:25,760
Yes, I'm on my way now. Okay.

685
00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:28,470
I'm leaving for my rounds.

686
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:30,560
I'll buy you a nice meal
when I see you again. Okay?

687
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,680
Oh, right. Don't stay here.

688
00:41:32,770 --> 00:41:33,890
Go to the cafe in the lobby.

689
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:35,100
If you stay here,

690
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:37,730
whoever walks in will try to give you
advice and meddle. Okay?

691
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:39,690
Gosh, I'm out of breath.

692
00:41:39,770 --> 00:41:41,030
Bye.

693
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:47,320
-Is he a comedian?
-No.

694
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,620
He's Dr. Romantic.

695
00:41:58,580 --> 00:42:00,630
What's wrong with you? Are you all right?

696
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:03,130
What do you mean? I want Coke.

697
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:05,720
Your face is very swollen.

698
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:06,970
You should...

699
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:08,760
Oh, this. I have menstrual cramps.

700
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,180
I took some medicine.

701
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:12,180
I think the medication
caused the swelling.

702
00:42:13,850 --> 00:42:15,600
Hello, Professor Lee.

703
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:17,390
What happened?

704
00:42:18,650 --> 00:42:20,900
-Go to the ER now.
-What?

705
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:22,860
I'm all right. I'm just

706
00:42:23,530 --> 00:42:25,530
feeling under the weather today.

707
00:42:25,610 --> 00:42:26,820
No, you're not okay.

708
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:29,200
It looks like an allergic reaction.
What did you have today?

709
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,950
Nothing really.

710
00:42:33,490 --> 00:42:34,580
What?

711
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:37,000
-Hey.
-Oh, no.

712
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:39,540
We ran a blood test,

713
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,300
and you have
the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome.

714
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:45,300
To maintain a healthy pregnancy,

715
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:47,130
your blood has to flow well.

716
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:49,430
But with this syndrome,

717
00:42:49,510 --> 00:42:52,140
it's hard for your blood to circulate.

718
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:55,680
Forming a placenta and maintaining
your pregnancy can be difficult.

719
00:42:56,270 --> 00:43:00,560
Then, is this similar to
having recurrent pregnancy loss?

720
00:43:01,150 --> 00:43:02,150
Yes.

721
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:06,280
So, this is your third pregnancy.

722
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:08,360
And you had two previous miscarriages.

723
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:12,700
Let's see. You're seven weeks pregnant.

724
00:43:13,830 --> 00:43:14,910
Yes.

725
00:43:17,710 --> 00:43:18,870
Here.

726
00:43:19,370 --> 00:43:22,290
I'd like to prescribe some medication.

727
00:43:22,590 --> 00:43:25,380
You should get heparin shots.

728
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:29,430
This shot will prevent
the blood from clotting.

729
00:43:29,510 --> 00:43:32,180
You can easily get these shots.

730
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:35,600
This is similar to the insulin shots
diabetes patients get.

731
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,600
And the needle is very thin,

732
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,770
so it won't hurt as much.

733
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:42,440
And our nurse will thoroughly explain

734
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:45,020
how to inject the shots
and take the medication.

735
00:43:45,110 --> 00:43:48,440
Come back after two weeks,
and I'll check on your condition, then.

736
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:54,780
Professor,

737
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:58,660
you must have seen a lot of mothers
with this kind of disease.

738
00:43:59,620 --> 00:44:01,670
So you must think
this is nothing serious, right?

739
00:44:03,670 --> 00:44:05,670
Why is miscarriage a disease?

740
00:44:11,430 --> 00:44:13,180
Miscarriage isn't a disease.

741
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:17,010
Of course, you did nothing wrong here.

742
00:44:18,930 --> 00:44:21,440
A lot of patients
that had miscarriages ask me

743
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:24,770
if they did something wrong
or if they must be careful in the future.

744
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:25,810
That's not true.

745
00:44:26,820 --> 00:44:29,530
This can happen to anyone.

746
00:44:31,530 --> 00:44:33,910
And besides, you know the cause this time.

747
00:44:33,990 --> 00:44:35,780
We can prepare for it
and help you get treated.

748
00:44:35,870 --> 00:44:38,120
Then you may be able to
have a healthy baby.

749
00:44:38,620 --> 00:44:40,660
So make sure you get your heparin shots.

750
00:44:40,750 --> 00:44:43,040
And take it easy for the time being.

751
00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:45,460
Okay.

752
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:47,210
Thank you.

753
00:44:51,010 --> 00:44:52,470
-Are we done?
-Yes.

754
00:44:52,550 --> 00:44:53,430
We're done for today.

755
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:54,680
Lunch?

756
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:57,390
It's on me. Let's go!

757
00:44:57,930 --> 00:44:58,930
Okay.

758
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:05,230
Two pieces of chocolate cake,
to-go, please.

759
00:45:05,730 --> 00:45:08,650
-How many forks do you need?
-One. Both of them are for me.

760
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:12,150
Cardiothoracic Surgery, Code Blue.

761
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:14,320
To the hallway in front of Room 6210.

762
00:45:14,410 --> 00:45:16,780
-Emergency for CS, right?
-Cardiothoracic Surgery, Code Blue.

763
00:45:16,870 --> 00:45:19,160
To the hallway in front of Room 6210.

764
00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:41,850
-Is it Professor Park Jin-u's patient?
-Yes.

765
00:45:41,930 --> 00:45:44,440
The patient had endocarditis,
so they performed an AVR.

766
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:46,400
I'll check the rhythm.

767
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:50,980
-His heart is beating.
-Mr. Lee Jong-hyeon.

768
00:45:51,530 --> 00:45:53,360
Mr. Lee Jong-hyeon, are you all right?

769
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:01,120
What a relief.

770
00:46:02,450 --> 00:46:03,910
-Bye.
-Bye.

771
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,580
Check if it's flowing right. Well done.

772
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:11,170
Professor Kim.

773
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:13,880
Hello.

774
00:46:14,670 --> 00:46:15,720
I'm Cheon Myeong-tae.

775
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:18,260
Hi. I'm Kim Jun-wan.

776
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:21,050
So you're the big shot at CS.

777
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:22,890
I am?

778
00:46:22,970 --> 00:46:25,980
You're in charge of the VIP Ward,
so I say you are.

779
00:46:27,810 --> 00:46:29,730
One's talent makes
all the difference to doctors.

780
00:46:33,650 --> 00:46:35,400
What are you doing this weekend?

781
00:46:36,490 --> 00:46:37,700
Do you like golf?

782
00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:42,780
Over there. There are two empty seats.

783
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:45,080
Professor Yang, over there.

784
00:46:45,620 --> 00:46:47,210
Go ahead. It's all right.

785
00:46:47,660 --> 00:46:49,540
Seon-jin, take the seat over there.

786
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:51,840
Professor Yang, let's sit here.

787
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:52,920
Okay.

788
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:03,470
I have a question.

789
00:47:04,060 --> 00:47:06,100
-Can I?
-Yes.

790
00:47:09,140 --> 00:47:10,440
Well,

791
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:13,820
you met a woman in a navy lace dress

792
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:16,900
at the outdoor garden last week.
Who is she?

793
00:47:19,450 --> 00:47:20,280
You two

794
00:47:21,110 --> 00:47:23,370
looked cozy together
when you were talking to each other.

795
00:47:23,450 --> 00:47:24,740
Who is she?

796
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:32,710
Oh, her.

797
00:47:33,590 --> 00:47:36,050
The mistress of Taegeon Apparel's
Chairman Yang Tae-yang.

798
00:47:36,130 --> 00:47:37,210
What?

799
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:39,550
She's the mistress
of Chairman Yang Tae-yang.

800
00:47:40,510 --> 00:47:41,340
I see.

801
00:47:41,430 --> 00:47:43,100
It was in the news, so you know, right?

802
00:47:43,180 --> 00:47:45,350
I think the whole hospital knows.

803
00:47:45,930 --> 00:47:48,520
I'm all right. I've been used to it
since I was in school.

804
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:58,150
I see empty seats over there.
Jeong-won, look.

805
00:47:58,240 --> 00:47:59,070
Okay.

806
00:48:01,030 --> 00:48:04,580
Oh, right. Hey, do we have
band practice tomorrow?

807
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:08,410
Don't make any plans tomorrow night.
Okay, Jeong-won?

808
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:09,370
Okay.

809
00:48:12,170 --> 00:48:13,960
You finished.
You didn't pick at your food.

810
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:15,750
I was never picky with my food.

811
00:48:16,550 --> 00:48:18,840
Don't be picky with people, you prick.

812
00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:22,340
My resident is here.

813
00:48:25,550 --> 00:48:27,430
You're best friends with Dr. Jang, right?

814
00:48:27,850 --> 00:48:29,680
Yes, I am. How do you know that?

815
00:48:30,310 --> 00:48:31,690
I see you together all the time.

816
00:48:31,770 --> 00:48:33,770
Right. Gyeo-ul is in the ER now.

817
00:48:33,850 --> 00:48:34,940
My gosh, why?

818
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:37,360
It's gotten better after she got the shot.

819
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:39,480
I think she had anaphylaxis from NSAIDs.

820
00:48:39,570 --> 00:48:40,610
SUDDEN REACTION TO THE BODY

821
00:48:40,690 --> 00:48:43,280
Her face swelled 30 minutes
after taking the pill for cramps.

822
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:44,450
Then, she couldn't breathe.

823
00:48:44,530 --> 00:48:46,700
She passed out like a scene in the movie.

824
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:49,240
-Oh, no. Please excuse me.
-Okay.

825
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:51,660
She's much better now.

826
00:48:51,750 --> 00:48:53,080
She's probably asleep.

827
00:48:54,540 --> 00:48:56,960
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

828
00:49:10,890 --> 00:49:12,230
Gosh. Are you okay?

829
00:49:12,430 --> 00:49:14,480
Are you in pain? Should I call Hui-su?

830
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:17,060
No. I'm not in pain anymore.

831
00:49:18,020 --> 00:49:19,360
Did you sleep here?

832
00:49:19,690 --> 00:49:20,980
Is it dawn now?

833
00:49:21,740 --> 00:49:23,200
Yes, it's night.

834
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:26,620
But you've been getting
a lot of text messages.

835
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:28,490
A lot of professors came to check on you.

836
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:34,460
I should have chosen GS too.

837
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:36,920
They don't treat you like a resident.

838
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,880
You're treated like a princess.

839
00:49:45,930 --> 00:49:47,300
I heard you were sick.

840
00:49:47,430 --> 00:49:49,050
Are you feeling better now?

841
00:49:49,140 --> 00:49:50,930
Get a lot of rest and feel better.

842
00:49:51,430 --> 00:49:52,890
He sent me a smiley face, right?

843
00:49:55,190 --> 00:49:56,850
Yes. A smiley face.

844
00:49:56,940 --> 00:49:59,310
That's not a tilde. It's a smiley face.

845
00:50:00,610 --> 00:50:02,440
Yes, it is. It's a smiley face.

846
00:50:02,530 --> 00:50:03,740
What about it?

847
00:50:06,530 --> 00:50:08,530
Could he have feelings for me?

848
00:50:08,620 --> 00:50:10,080
What?

849
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:12,450
Professor Ahn likes me, right?

850
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:15,410
No.

851
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,250
Why not?

852
00:50:17,330 --> 00:50:19,040
If he likes you,

853
00:50:19,540 --> 00:50:21,170
he would have come here.

854
00:50:27,220 --> 00:50:28,510
You like him, don't you?

855
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:32,890
Dr. Jang,

856
00:50:32,970 --> 00:50:36,230
you like Professor Ahn, right?

857
00:50:41,270 --> 00:50:42,150
Yes.

858
00:50:51,830 --> 00:50:52,870
Yes, Song-hwa.

859
00:50:53,830 --> 00:50:56,120
Okay. Hold on.

860
00:50:56,870 --> 00:50:59,330
Jun-wan, Song-hwa needs to talk to us.
She wants to grab dinner.

861
00:50:59,420 --> 00:51:01,920
-You're free, right?
-Of course.

862
00:51:02,420 --> 00:51:03,500
Yes, he can.

863
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,550
Okay. We're on our way out, too.

864
00:51:07,170 --> 00:51:08,510
Okay. See you soon.

865
00:51:11,140 --> 00:51:13,930
Something sounded off about her.
Did something happen?

866
00:51:16,270 --> 00:51:18,190
Why? How did she sound?

867
00:51:19,230 --> 00:51:21,190
She acts as if everything is fine,

868
00:51:21,270 --> 00:51:23,610
but I think something is up with her.

869
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:29,150
Why are you telling us that now?

870
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:30,950
When did you get tested?

871
00:51:33,030 --> 00:51:34,530
It's been a week.

872
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:36,370
I got a biopsy.

873
00:51:36,830 --> 00:51:38,120
I'll get the result tomorrow.

874
00:51:40,290 --> 00:51:41,670
The core biopsy.

875
00:51:41,750 --> 00:51:42,960
Yes, that.

876
00:51:46,130 --> 00:51:47,340
The shape doesn't look good.

877
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:51,760
When the doctor told me that,
it did scare me a bit.

878
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:53,760
Hey, how could you joke about that?

879
00:51:53,850 --> 00:51:56,600
Why did you go to Jae-an Medical Center?
If you had asked me or Ik-jun,

880
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:58,230
we would've taken care of it right away.

881
00:51:58,310 --> 00:51:59,680
When does the result come out?

882
00:51:59,770 --> 00:52:02,190
My cousin works there. I'll ask him now.

883
00:52:02,270 --> 00:52:04,610
My gosh, stop it.

884
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:07,780
I didn't tell you
because I knew you'd make a fuss.

885
00:52:09,110 --> 00:52:12,160
If it's bad,
people in the hospital will talk about it.

886
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:13,660
I hate that.

887
00:52:13,740 --> 00:52:15,080
What are you talking about?

888
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:16,660
It's not going to be bad.

889
00:52:17,330 --> 00:52:19,120
The result must be out already.
I'll call them.

890
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:21,120
Stop it. Don't. Seriously, stop it.

891
00:52:21,210 --> 00:52:23,380
I'll find out tomorrow morning.
What's the point?

892
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:25,750
I really don't want you to do it,
so don't.

893
00:52:27,210 --> 00:52:30,130
This is why I had it done
at another hospital.

894
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:33,510
Please don't do anything. Please?

895
00:52:33,590 --> 00:52:35,100
What time tomorrow?

896
00:52:35,180 --> 00:52:37,220
-Seven.
-That early?

897
00:52:37,310 --> 00:52:40,230
Yes. My schedule is full this week.

898
00:52:40,310 --> 00:52:42,640
When I said I couldn't make it,
they bumped me up by an hour.

899
00:52:42,730 --> 00:52:45,190
They start seeing outpatients at eight
like we do.

900
00:52:45,270 --> 00:52:46,610
I'm very grateful for it.

901
00:52:46,690 --> 00:52:50,030
Did you say you couldn't get the result
because of your outpatients?

902
00:52:51,030 --> 00:52:52,900
Unbelievable.
You could've talked to the hospital

903
00:52:52,990 --> 00:52:54,700
and rescheduled the appointments.

904
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:56,030
Are you that inflexible?

905
00:52:56,120 --> 00:52:58,950
How could I do that? Some patients
made appointments months ago.

906
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:01,120
Many are coming to Seoul
from the countryside.

907
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:04,330
I'll be fine.
I'll go and get the result myself.

908
00:53:05,250 --> 00:53:07,540
My gosh, you and your nagging.

909
00:53:07,630 --> 00:53:09,500
But that's an excellent doctor.

910
00:53:10,010 --> 00:53:11,970
Your doctor is coming to work
early for you.

911
00:53:12,050 --> 00:53:14,760
Right? It's so early. I can never do that.

912
00:53:15,340 --> 00:53:17,140
Let me know as soon as you get the result.

913
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:18,720
Okay.

914
00:53:18,810 --> 00:53:22,100
-Should I go with you?
-Don't you dare! I'm serious.

915
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:24,640
I'm sure it's nothing.

916
00:53:24,730 --> 00:53:26,980
Hey, let's eat. Dig in.

917
00:53:32,490 --> 00:53:33,820
It's not mine.

918
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:35,410
Not mine.

919
00:53:40,450 --> 00:53:41,450
Yes?

920
00:53:45,370 --> 00:53:46,750
Are the vitals stable?

921
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:48,880
Is there free air?

922
00:53:49,750 --> 00:53:51,000
Yes, I'm nearby.

923
00:53:52,670 --> 00:53:54,840
If there are a liver laceration
and a perforated bowel,

924
00:53:54,930 --> 00:53:56,470
I should explore that.

925
00:53:56,760 --> 00:53:58,970
Okay. I'll be there soon.

926
00:54:00,010 --> 00:54:02,390
Darn it. I'm leaving.

927
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:03,850
Good luck.

928
00:54:07,690 --> 00:54:10,020
I got off work,
but I'm at the hospital again.

929
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:12,400
Do you have an emergency patient?

930
00:54:13,150 --> 00:54:14,780
Yes, the patient was in a car accident.

931
00:54:14,860 --> 00:54:17,490
I think the patient's liver
and bowel need surgery.

932
00:54:17,570 --> 00:54:21,080
Oh, no. You'll probably
have to pull an all-nighter.

933
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:23,120
Yes, I'll probably be done in the morning.

934
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:24,410
And that's if I'm fast.

935
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:27,620
Then, you should come to my shoot
when you're done in the morning.

936
00:54:27,710 --> 00:54:28,790
It's nearby.

937
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:31,040
I must be on standby
early in the morning tomorrow, too.

938
00:54:31,130 --> 00:54:34,380
I'll buy you coffee. There are a lot
of convenience stores nearby.

939
00:54:34,460 --> 00:54:37,180
I should buy you coffee.
You treated me last time.

940
00:54:38,890 --> 00:54:41,510
If I finish early in the morning,

941
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:44,140
I'll try to visit you.
I might not be able to make it, though.

942
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:46,390
Okay. Good luck with the surgery.

943
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:48,730
I hope I can see you tomorrow morning.

944
00:54:48,980 --> 00:54:50,150
Okay.

945
00:54:51,730 --> 00:54:53,820
ELAPSED TIME

946
00:54:59,570 --> 00:55:01,120
I think the repair is holding well.

947
00:55:30,850 --> 00:55:32,360
I'll take these.

948
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:55,440
COMPREHENSIVE MEDICAL EXAMINATION CENTER

949
00:57:07,370 --> 00:57:10,200
Seriously? Why are you here?

950
00:57:11,450 --> 00:57:14,080
Why do you think?
I came because I'm worried.

951
00:57:22,340 --> 00:57:24,470
Look at that big yawn. Goodness.

952
00:57:24,550 --> 00:57:26,890
You should just get some sleep at home.

953
00:57:26,970 --> 00:57:29,680
-Why did you come?
-How could I sleep?

954
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:33,140
Hello.

955
00:57:33,230 --> 00:57:34,560
Hello.

956
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:36,230
Thank you for seeing us this early.

957
00:57:36,310 --> 00:57:38,440
Gosh, don't mention it.
This happens a few times.

958
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:41,400
-Please wait.
-Hold on. Have some of this.

959
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:43,240
It's really cheap. It's nothing big.

960
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:44,400
No, it's all right.

961
00:57:44,490 --> 00:57:46,360
I bought way too many. That's why.

962
00:57:46,450 --> 00:57:48,120
Please take some. I'm begging you.

963
00:57:48,910 --> 00:57:50,830
Thank you. Please give us ten minutes.

964
00:57:50,910 --> 00:57:51,910
Okay. We can wait.

965
00:58:05,260 --> 00:58:09,550
Hey, what if I have cancer?

966
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:12,600
You can get it fixed.

967
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:17,400
I'll fix it no matter what.

968
00:58:22,820 --> 00:58:25,280
-It's nice.
-What?

969
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:27,320
Getting a confident answer
from the doctor.

970
00:58:29,490 --> 00:58:34,290
Now, I understand why doctors
shouldn't give out such answers.

971
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,210
It's so nice to hear that.

972
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:42,340
It makes me think
you'll fix whatever is wrong with me.

973
00:58:44,380 --> 00:58:48,090
That's why I should never say things
like that to my patients.

974
00:58:49,090 --> 00:58:50,760
What if something goes wrong?

975
00:58:53,060 --> 00:58:54,680
If the result comes out badly,

976
00:58:58,650 --> 00:59:01,270
I think they would be in utter despair.

977
00:59:12,490 --> 00:59:13,740
Yes, Seok-hyeong.

978
00:59:15,620 --> 00:59:17,080
I'm about to go in.

979
00:59:18,460 --> 00:59:21,040
Okay. I'll tell you right away.

980
00:59:22,460 --> 00:59:23,840
Okay.

981
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:30,220
-Can Seok-hyeong make calls?
-Yes. Why?

982
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:32,680
I thought he only texted.

983
00:59:33,050 --> 00:59:34,760
He calls me often.

984
00:59:40,900 --> 00:59:42,400
A long time ago,

985
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:44,860
Seok-hyeong liked you a lot.

986
00:59:45,110 --> 00:59:46,150
Hey.

987
00:59:47,150 --> 00:59:48,740
That's ancient history.

988
00:59:49,610 --> 00:59:53,910
You know the day when
Seok-hyeong told you that he liked you?

989
00:59:54,830 --> 00:59:56,660
Did you know that he slept on the street?

990
00:59:57,910 --> 00:59:59,660
-Really?
-Yes.

991
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:03,130
He and I had drinks that night.

992
01:00:03,330 --> 01:00:06,090
He told me that he confessed his feelings
and you turned him down.

993
01:00:07,420 --> 01:00:09,090
We had drinks and went home.

994
01:00:09,170 --> 01:00:11,340
But late at night,
I got a call from the police station.

995
01:00:11,430 --> 01:00:12,840
They told me to take my friend home.

996
01:00:13,090 --> 01:00:15,510
They called me
because I was the last person he called.

997
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:17,520
I was confused and went to the station.

998
01:00:18,020 --> 01:00:21,770
My gosh. He was sleeping on the street,
and the officers brought him there

999
01:00:21,850 --> 01:00:23,770
so he didn't freeze to death.

1000
01:00:25,820 --> 01:00:28,030
Seriously.
That brings back so many memories.

1001
01:00:28,110 --> 01:00:29,570
So many memories.

1002
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:35,660
Wait, so you knew.

1003
01:00:37,240 --> 01:00:38,490
Why did you pretend you didn't?

1004
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:41,410
I only knew that Seok-hyeong liked you.

1005
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:42,710
I didn't know it in detail.

1006
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:45,290
Ms. Chae Song-hwa, please come in.

1007
01:00:45,790 --> 01:00:46,630
Okay.

1008
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:08,480
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

1009
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:20,660
We have ten more minutes, right?

1010
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,040
Yes.

1011
01:01:23,540 --> 01:01:24,960
Should I go and get you some coffee?

1012
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:28,000
No. I'm good. I was just checking.

1013
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:30,920
Wait. Now that you ask me,

1014
01:01:31,010 --> 01:01:32,920
I kind of want coffee.

1015
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:35,640
What is it?

1016
01:01:36,340 --> 01:01:39,560
-I'm fine. It's benign.
-Okay. Great.

1017
01:01:45,980 --> 01:01:47,440
What's the result?

1018
01:01:48,360 --> 01:01:51,320
It's a fibroadenoma.
We'll test it again in six months.

1019
01:01:51,980 --> 01:01:53,570
I knew it.

1020
01:01:53,650 --> 01:01:55,990
-You did well. See you later, then.
-Okay.

1021
01:01:59,950 --> 01:02:02,870
It's benign. Are we good now?

1022
01:02:08,250 --> 01:02:09,460
Did everyone come?

1023
01:02:09,540 --> 01:02:11,210
There's one more.

1024
01:02:12,380 --> 01:02:13,970
Did you call the guys today?

1025
01:02:14,050 --> 01:02:15,840
I saw them visit you one at a time.

1026
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:18,510
You know we have
band practice today, right?

1027
01:02:18,590 --> 01:02:19,680
See you later.

1028
01:02:21,430 --> 01:02:23,980
My brother-in-law, have a great day.

1029
01:02:48,460 --> 01:02:50,040
You can't finish it, right? Pour me some.

1030
01:02:51,250 --> 01:02:53,300
What if we get addicted to Coke?

1031
01:02:53,380 --> 01:02:56,340
I can't drink because I'm worried
that the hospital will call me.

1032
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:59,640
Jun-wan, do you want Coke or Sprite?

1033
01:02:59,720 --> 01:03:01,800
He's busy.
His mom's about to build a hinoki tub.

1034
01:03:01,890 --> 01:03:04,470
What? You want to switch to cypress?

1035
01:03:05,140 --> 01:03:09,020
Mom, hinoki is cypress.
They are the same thing.

1036
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:12,400
Heopa also means lung. Kongpat, kidney.

1037
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:14,480
Jjijimi, pancake. Jeonguji, chives.

1038
01:03:14,570 --> 01:03:16,400
-Jeonguji means chives?
-Yes.

1039
01:03:17,150 --> 01:03:18,400
I'm with my friends.

1040
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:22,370
Okay. I'll call you later.

1041
01:03:23,410 --> 01:03:24,240
Okay.

1042
01:03:25,160 --> 01:03:26,410
We're playing Zoo's song, right?

1043
01:03:26,500 --> 01:03:27,910
Did you bring your guitar?

1044
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:32,460
You can switch back to standard Korean
right away. That's impressive.

1045
01:03:32,540 --> 01:03:34,300
What? I don't speak with a dialect.

1046
01:03:34,380 --> 01:03:36,210
Buddy, eat it with jeonguji.

1047
01:03:36,300 --> 01:03:37,970
All right.

1048
01:03:38,050 --> 01:03:39,300
Did you know

1049
01:03:40,180 --> 01:03:41,800
you two had a huge transformation?

1050
01:03:44,100 --> 01:03:45,850
-Us two?
-Yes.

1051
01:03:45,930 --> 01:03:47,390
What on earth are you talking about?

1052
01:03:48,140 --> 01:03:50,100
These guys looked worse back then.
Especially, you.

1053
01:03:52,520 --> 01:03:53,940
What about me?

1054
01:03:54,020 --> 01:03:56,690
You wanted to copy Leslie Cheung.
You parted your hair and got a perm.

1055
01:03:57,320 --> 01:03:59,400
Don't distort the truth, Ik-jun.

1056
01:03:59,950 --> 01:04:01,740
You two were worse.

1057
01:04:01,820 --> 01:04:02,910
How did we look back then?

1058
01:04:18,590 --> 01:04:20,170
Like this.

1059
01:04:20,260 --> 01:04:21,590
You prick.

1060
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:23,760
-You prick.
-That was Jun-wan.

1061
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:25,970
You prick.

1062
01:04:26,100 --> 01:04:28,520
No, they weren't that bad.
They looked like this.

1063
01:04:29,020 --> 01:04:30,100
-You prick.
-No.

1064
01:04:30,180 --> 01:04:32,100
-He looked like this.
-My gosh. Hey.

1065
01:04:32,190 --> 01:04:35,480
LINE 2, EXIT 3

1066
01:04:36,520 --> 01:04:37,480
Is this the way?

1067
01:04:42,910 --> 01:04:45,070
Where's the school? Why can't I see it?

1068
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:47,740
We have to take a bus here. Bus 289-1.

1069
01:04:47,830 --> 01:04:49,660
It's the school entrance. Why take a bus?

1070
01:04:51,790 --> 01:04:53,290
If I knew the answer to that,

1071
01:04:53,370 --> 01:04:56,130
why would I be standing here with you,
holding this paper like a fool?

1072
01:04:56,210 --> 01:04:59,050
-It's freezing cold today.
-You said you'd been to Seoul. You forgot?

1073
01:04:59,130 --> 01:05:02,260
You've been here too, man. We went to
the National Assembly on our school trip.

1074
01:05:03,340 --> 01:05:04,840
-Did we?
-Yes.

1075
01:05:08,510 --> 01:05:10,390
Do you have any change? A 1,000-won bill?

1076
01:05:12,060 --> 01:05:14,310
I only have 10,000-won bills.

1077
01:05:14,810 --> 01:05:16,440
Same here.

1078
01:05:16,520 --> 01:05:17,520
How much is the bus fare?

1079
01:05:18,020 --> 01:05:19,900
-It's 340 won. Seriously?
-What?

1080
01:05:19,980 --> 01:05:22,570
Things in Seoul are so expensive.
It's no place to live!

1081
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:24,950
But I'm still going to live in Seoul.

1082
01:05:25,030 --> 01:05:27,620
-Wait here. I'll go and break the bill.
-At where?

1083
01:05:27,700 --> 01:05:30,580
I'll buy something at the cart over there
and get smaller bills.

1084
01:05:34,170 --> 01:05:35,040
Sir.

1085
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:37,500
How much is it?

1086
01:05:37,590 --> 01:05:40,670
Where are you from? Busan? Masan?

1087
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:43,170
That's 700 won.

1088
01:05:50,600 --> 01:05:52,430
-What about this?
-3,000 won.

1089
01:05:52,520 --> 01:05:53,430
Here.

1090
01:05:54,600 --> 01:05:55,560
Here.

1091
01:05:56,440 --> 01:05:57,560
Good luck with the interview.

1092
01:05:57,650 --> 01:05:59,610
Thank you. Have a good day.

1093
01:06:00,150 --> 01:06:01,820
MEDICAL SCHOOL INTERVIEW
WAITING AREA

1094
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:04,530
EXAM SCHEDULE

1095
01:06:14,580 --> 01:06:17,920
Ik-jun, I don't think I did well
on my essay exam.

1096
01:06:18,170 --> 01:06:21,130
You should cut
your side-swept bangs first.

1097
01:06:21,210 --> 01:06:23,840
-What do you mean?
-I had to take a dump in the bathroom.

1098
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:25,880
But it was packed with people,

1099
01:06:25,970 --> 01:06:28,010
so I used the staff bathroom downstairs.

1100
01:06:28,090 --> 01:06:29,890
Guess what I heard there.

1101
01:06:30,050 --> 01:06:33,890
Do you know what the most important factor
they are considering this year is?

1102
01:06:34,310 --> 01:06:35,350
What is it?

1103
01:06:36,230 --> 01:06:37,350
Jeonggal.

1104
01:06:38,230 --> 01:06:39,310
Jeongal?

1105
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:43,030
No, I said, Jeonggal. Not scorpion.

1106
01:06:43,110 --> 01:06:46,610
Jeonggam? You mean, "warmhearted"?
Gosh, that's my weak point.

1107
01:06:47,740 --> 01:06:49,870
Go and clean your ears first, you prick.

1108
01:06:49,950 --> 01:06:51,160
I saw a shovel over there.

1109
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:53,160
-What the heck?
-Neatness.

1110
01:06:53,700 --> 01:06:55,960
They're going to pick neat students.

1111
01:06:56,040 --> 01:06:57,120
Go cut your hair now.

1112
01:06:57,210 --> 01:06:58,290
Really? Darn it.

1113
01:07:11,010 --> 01:07:12,970
-Thank you.
-Don't mention it.

1114
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:08,490
I saw you again in front

1115
01:08:08,570 --> 01:08:12,160
Of the subway station at the city hall

1116
01:08:12,570 --> 01:08:16,790
When I turned around to buy newspapers

1117
01:08:16,870 --> 01:08:20,040
I saw your figure

1118
01:08:20,620 --> 01:08:25,670
At the crowded newsstand

1119
01:08:25,750 --> 01:08:29,470
When I called out your name

1120
01:08:30,510 --> 01:08:33,890
You looked surprised

1121
01:08:45,270 --> 01:08:49,610
When I was about to go to you

1122
01:08:49,690 --> 01:08:53,910
I stepped on someone's foot

1123
01:08:53,990 --> 01:08:58,580
I had to say I was sorry

1124
01:08:58,660 --> 01:09:01,290
With a big smile

1125
01:09:01,790 --> 01:09:07,130
We talked about our lives
And how we changed

1126
01:09:07,210 --> 01:09:11,420
We even talked about the weather
Which was boring

1127
01:09:11,510 --> 01:09:14,640
The flooding memories

1128
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:18,470
Quickly exhausted us

1129
01:09:18,850 --> 01:09:22,730
That time which seemed so slow

1130
01:09:22,810 --> 01:09:26,650
Passed us by

1131
01:09:27,150 --> 01:09:31,190
You told me that you were a mother of two

1132
01:09:31,280 --> 01:09:34,450
With a gentle smile on your face

1133
01:09:35,160 --> 01:09:40,410
When you asked me how I am doing

1134
01:09:40,490 --> 01:09:44,500
I just shrugged my shoulders
In disappointment

1135
01:09:44,580 --> 01:09:47,750
And told you that I was still looking for

1136
01:09:47,840 --> 01:09:51,590
The love of my life somewhere
In this world

1137
01:09:53,300 --> 01:09:59,760
-If we run into each other again someday
-If we run into each other again someday

1138
01:10:01,220 --> 01:10:07,270
-You said you'd show me your children
-You said you'd show me your children

1139
01:10:09,770 --> 01:10:15,860
-But the song engraved in our hearts
-But the song engraved in our hearts

1140
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:19,370
-From that day
-From that day

1141
01:10:19,450 --> 01:10:24,000
-Is still fresh like it was yesterday
-Is still fresh like it was yesterday

1142
01:11:22,890 --> 01:11:27,180
You told me that
Things were getting tough between us

1143
01:11:27,690 --> 01:11:31,110
That could have been
The reason you left me

1144
01:11:32,110 --> 01:11:35,360
But I can't know for sure

1145
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:37,860
Sing it, everyone.

1146
01:11:40,570 --> 01:11:44,870
I remember the night when you left me

1147
01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:53,880
You in my memory

1148
01:11:56,510 --> 01:11:57,670
All right.

1149
01:11:57,760 --> 01:12:00,930
Hey, I'm sorry. No, I mean... Never mind.

1150
01:12:01,010 --> 01:12:02,140
I'm okay.

1151
01:12:02,970 --> 01:12:06,520
Song-hwa, I'm sorry for bringing up
such nonsense.

1152
01:12:37,460 --> 01:12:38,880
Did you want to meet up?

1153
01:12:39,470 --> 01:12:41,470
Okay. Where should we meet?

1154
01:12:43,640 --> 01:12:46,010
I'm sorry. Something just came up.

1155
01:12:46,510 --> 01:12:47,600
Let's meet some other time.

1156
01:13:06,160 --> 01:13:09,410
DRINKS AND MEALS,
CUSTOMERS FOR A CENTURY

1157
01:13:09,500 --> 01:13:11,330
No. Bye.

1158
01:14:20,270 --> 01:14:21,190
Hello?

1159
01:14:22,860 --> 01:14:24,700
Where? Who is this?

1160
01:14:45,670 --> 01:14:51,050
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, CHAE SONG-HWA

1161
01:14:51,140 --> 01:14:54,060
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

1162
01:14:59,560 --> 01:15:01,860
Thank you. Thank you for the coffee.

1163
01:15:02,980 --> 01:15:05,070
You're even diligent. My gosh.

1164
01:15:08,240 --> 01:15:11,330
If you have questions, ask Song-hwa.
She really likes that.

1165
01:15:11,410 --> 01:15:12,700
Okay.

1166
01:15:13,080 --> 01:15:15,580
Professor Chae is a good person.

1167
01:15:16,210 --> 01:15:17,460
She is.

1168
01:15:18,040 --> 01:15:21,790
I respect her very much and like her.

1169
01:15:23,670 --> 01:15:25,380
Okay.

1170
01:15:28,010 --> 01:15:29,760
Have you been talking to Ik-sun lately?

1171
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:31,050
Yes.

1172
01:15:31,470 --> 01:15:33,390
We talk on the phone at least once a week.

1173
01:15:33,470 --> 01:15:35,140
She's a really close friend of mine.

1174
01:15:35,890 --> 01:15:37,350
Just like you and Professor Chae.

1175
01:15:37,430 --> 01:15:41,060
Right. There are times when I realize
she's a woman, not just a friend.

1176
01:15:41,150 --> 01:15:42,400
My gosh, no.

1177
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:45,280
We're really not involved romantically.

1178
01:15:46,070 --> 01:15:50,360
Besides, Ik-sun is still hurt
by what happened in the past.

1179
01:15:52,410 --> 01:15:54,990
She said she's not ready to date

1180
01:15:55,910 --> 01:15:57,290
someone yet.

1181
01:15:58,790 --> 01:16:00,080
She said she can't trust anyone.

1182
01:16:01,960 --> 01:16:04,000
I think it will take her some time.

1183
01:16:04,750 --> 01:16:06,050
Really?

1184
01:16:08,380 --> 01:16:09,550
Probably.

1185
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:32,030
I'm paying this month's utility bill.

1186
01:16:32,110 --> 01:16:34,030
Jeong-won said he already paid.

1187
01:16:34,120 --> 01:16:36,830
My gosh, I guess
he's doing better financially.

1188
01:16:36,910 --> 01:16:38,410
That moocher paid the utility bill.

1189
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:41,330
Did something happen?

1190
01:16:41,420 --> 01:16:43,330
You look down today.

1191
01:16:44,460 --> 01:16:45,960
It's nothing really. But...

1192
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:48,840
My gosh, I had no idea,

1193
01:16:51,010 --> 01:16:52,340
but Ik-sun...

1194
01:16:56,560 --> 01:16:58,060
A NEW MESSAGE FROM IK-SUN

1195
01:16:58,640 --> 01:16:59,850
Bye.

1196
01:17:12,240 --> 01:17:13,610
Yes for what?

1197
01:17:21,870 --> 01:17:23,620
Today is our first day as a couple.

1198
01:18:01,240 --> 01:18:02,620
Hello?

1199
01:18:04,790 --> 01:18:06,000
What are you doing?

1200
01:18:08,090 --> 01:18:10,130
Really? Okay.

1201
01:18:11,210 --> 01:18:13,300
I don't have any surgery today.

1202
01:18:13,380 --> 01:18:14,760
Did you eat?

1203
01:18:15,880 --> 01:18:16,890
Who?

1204
01:18:18,850 --> 01:18:21,350
I see. I didn't know
there was a position for that.

1205
01:18:22,060 --> 01:18:23,350
Are you guys close to each other?

1206
01:18:24,020 --> 01:18:25,270
I see.

1207
01:18:26,270 --> 01:18:29,520
Okay. When is your next day off?

1208
01:18:33,780 --> 01:18:36,150
No, don't do that.

1209
01:18:36,240 --> 01:18:38,030
I'll go pick you up.

1210
01:18:38,120 --> 01:18:39,120
Okay.

1211
01:18:41,450 --> 01:18:42,700
Are you sure?

1212
01:18:42,790 --> 01:18:44,660
Yes, Ji-a will be the recipient.

1213
01:18:45,250 --> 01:18:48,170
The donor is a 22-year-old female.
She weighs 49kg.

1214
01:18:48,250 --> 01:18:50,790
And her LFT is under 40. It's all good.

1215
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:53,050
She stayed at Kangwoon Medical Center
for seven days.

1216
01:18:53,130 --> 01:18:55,590
Then, we'll get the surgery ready.

1217
01:18:56,300 --> 01:18:57,380
Okay.

1218
01:18:59,720 --> 01:19:01,300
Oh my gosh!

1219
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:03,970
Thank you, doctor.

1220
01:19:04,930 --> 01:19:06,480
Thank you so much, doctor.

1221
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:08,100
Thank you.

1222
01:19:08,310 --> 01:19:10,440
Thank you so much, doctor.

1223
01:19:12,360 --> 01:19:15,570
The committee that confirms brain death
must still go through the protocol.

1224
01:19:15,650 --> 01:19:19,280
And we must check the condition
of the liver from the donor.

1225
01:19:19,780 --> 01:19:22,030
But I think this will work.

1226
01:19:22,120 --> 01:19:25,200
We can proceed with the surgery tonight
at the earliest.

1227
01:19:30,380 --> 01:19:33,000
Then, my daughter, Ji-a,

1228
01:19:33,590 --> 01:19:36,380
can live now. Right, doctor?

1229
01:19:37,260 --> 01:19:38,470
Yes.

1230
01:19:39,130 --> 01:19:41,850
Thank you. Thank you so much.

1231
01:19:56,490 --> 01:19:58,820
How's the liver? Are you heading here now?

1232
01:19:58,900 --> 01:20:00,530
We have a problem, Professor Ahn.

1233
01:20:01,240 --> 01:20:02,570
What's wrong?

1234
01:20:02,660 --> 01:20:04,370
The donor's liver is too thick.

1235
01:20:05,620 --> 01:20:07,080
It looks like it weighs over 500g.

1236
01:20:07,160 --> 01:20:09,040
And her AP must be as thick as 8cm.

1237
01:20:09,370 --> 01:20:10,750
What should we do?

1238
01:20:16,300 --> 01:20:18,720
This liver seems too big for Ji-a.
It won't work.

1239
01:21:00,090 --> 01:21:02,550
This is the last and only way

1240
01:21:02,630 --> 01:21:04,010
to save the baby.

1241
01:21:05,470 --> 01:21:06,930
There's a lot of bleeding, doctor.

1242
01:21:07,010 --> 01:21:08,140
Would you like to try it

1243
01:21:08,720 --> 01:21:10,060
for the next surgery?

1244
01:21:10,140 --> 01:21:11,230
What?

1245
01:21:11,310 --> 01:21:12,730
I'm going to perform the surgery.

1246
01:21:12,810 --> 01:21:14,350
I'm so nervous.

1247
01:21:14,440 --> 01:21:16,190
I think you should give up.

1248
01:21:16,820 --> 01:21:18,440
It won't go badly, right?

1249
01:21:19,820 --> 01:21:22,070
It's too embarrassing if others find out.

1250
01:21:22,150 --> 01:21:23,860
Why is my life so hard?

1251
01:21:25,030 --> 01:21:26,990
What? It's fall already?

1252
01:21:27,080 --> 01:21:29,120
Gosh, is fall here already?

1253
01:21:29,200 --> 01:21:30,950
Is something good going on?

1254
01:21:31,040 --> 01:21:32,580
You're always in a good mood lately.

1255
01:21:32,660 --> 01:21:34,960
-A blind date?
-Really?

1256
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:36,500
Who is it?

1257
01:21:36,590 --> 01:21:38,130
Who is it that you're so crazy about?

1258
01:21:38,210 --> 01:21:39,840
Jun-wan, do I know her?

1259
01:21:39,920 --> 01:21:43,090
I'm Kim Jun-wan's friend, Lee Ik-jun.

1260
01:21:43,170 --> 01:21:44,970
The golf course there is really great.

1261
01:21:45,050 --> 01:21:46,640
The ball rolls in by itself.

1262
01:21:46,720 --> 01:21:49,220
An anonymous letter about bribery came in.

1263
01:21:51,390 --> 01:21:52,350
Did you go to play golf?

1264
01:21:52,430 --> 01:21:54,600
I heard the membership for the golf course

1265
01:21:55,400 --> 01:21:56,860
costs two hundred million won.

1266
01:21:56,940 --> 01:21:58,440
Hey, you didn't go, right?

1267
01:21:58,520 --> 01:22:00,110
Why? Is something going on?

1268
01:22:00,190 --> 01:22:02,650
