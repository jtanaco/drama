00:16:29,229 --> 00:16:31,459
<b>How are your preparations going?</b>

162
00:16:31,758 --> 00:16:34,428
<b>You're performing at such an amazing recital.</b>

163
00:16:35,069 --> 00:16:37,069
<b>Why all of a sudden...</b>

164
00:16:37,069 --> 00:16:38,439
<b>He spoke again.</b>

165
00:16:41,469 --> 00:16:42,939
<b>Please play the piece you wrote.</b>

166
00:16:43,739 --> 00:16:45,178
<b>"Number One".</b>

167
00:16:47,178 --> 00:16:49,749
<b>I want to listen to it right now.</b>

168
00:16:49,749 --> 00:16:51,048
<b>Well, Seo Woo.</b>

169
00:16:51,178 --> 00:16:52,778
<b>I don't play something just because someone asks...</b>

170
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:53,949
<b>Please do it.</b>

171
00:17:07,258 --> 00:17:10,669
<b>I want to hear his voice...</b>

172
00:17:10,969 --> 00:17:12,469
<b>and his piano.</b>

173
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:16,068
<b>It'll be hard for him to talk with me since I'm dead.</b>

174
00:17:16,969 --> 00:17:18,239
<b>Please.</b>

175
00:17:18,739 --> 00:17:20,739
<b>Let me listen by myself.</b>

176
00:17:28,749 --> 00:17:30,149
<b>Seo Woo.</b>

177
00:17:30,288 --> 00:17:33,518
<b>Continue. I'm listening.</b>

178
00:17:35,389 --> 00:17:37,258
<b>The longer, the better.</b>

179
00:17:39,459 --> 00:17:41,629
<b>I'll listen just for five minutes.</b>

180
00:17:48,338 --> 00:17:49,469
<b>I was...</b>

181
00:17:53,078 --> 00:17:54,909
<b>wrong this whole time.</b>

182
00:17:56,949 --> 00:17:58,278
<b>I was foolish.</b>

183
00:17:58,949 --> 00:18:01,149
<b>So don't take what I said to heart.</b>

184
00:18:02,889 --> 00:18:04,588
<b>Ha Won and Ji Soo...</b>

185
00:18:23,838 --> 00:18:26,879
<b>Please talk as if Ji Soo were here.</b>

186
00:18:32,379 --> 00:18:34,379
<b>I'll explain later.</b>

187
00:18:34,778 --> 00:18:36,219
<b>Do as I say.</b>

188
00:18:47,598 --> 00:18:48,899
<b>The device?</b>

189
00:19:00,808 --> 00:19:02,949
<b>She knows that she's dead.</b>

190
00:19:06,078 --> 00:19:08,949
<b>She asked me to let her hear your voice.</b>

191
00:19:12,358 --> 00:19:15,229
<b>Please do that for her.</b>

192
00:19:16,929 --> 00:19:18,258
<b>For Ji Soo...</b>

193
00:20:06,909 --> 00:20:07,979
<b>I thought...</b>

194
00:20:09,278 --> 00:20:11,879
<b>about Ji Soo as I wrote this piece.</b>

195
00:20:16,118 --> 00:20:17,219
<b>And...</b>

196
00:20:43,179 --> 00:20:44,679
<b>This one too.</b>

197
00:20:46,278 --> 00:20:47,479
<b>When Ji Soo...</b>

198
00:20:48,649 --> 00:20:51,048
<b>didn't know I existed.</b>

199
00:20:53,959 --> 00:20:56,659
<b>When I had a crush on her.</b>

200
00:21:00,429 --> 00:21:01,868
<b>And one day...</b>

201
00:21:10,808 --> 00:21:13,409
<b>when she first looked at me.</b>

202
00:21:15,278 --> 00:21:17,308
<b>Even after we got married,</b>

203
00:21:18,278 --> 00:21:19,379
<b>I always...</b>

204
00:21:21,719 --> 00:21:24,249
<b>thought about her when I played the piano.</b>

205
00:21:28,018 --> 00:21:29,588
<b>I love her,</b>

206
00:21:34,929 --> 00:21:36,499
<b>and I miss her.</b>

207
00:22:11,568 --> 00:22:14,268
<b>Wasn't it hard conversing with me?</b>

208
00:22:14,268 --> 00:22:15,338
<b>It feels like...</b>

209
00:22:15,469 --> 00:22:18,209
<b>I'm talking on the phone with a friend who lives far away.</b>

210
00:22:18,209 --> 00:22:20,379
<b>Do you think it'll stay that way?</b>

211
00:22:21,639 --> 00:22:23,108
<b>Be honest with me.</b>

212
00:22:27,578 --> 00:22:29,389
<b>I'm not so sure about that.</b>

213
00:22:30,018 --> 00:22:31,689
<b>You really are honest.</b>

214
00:22:32,358 --> 00:22:33,989
<b>Do me one last favor.</b>

215
00:22:34,758 --> 00:22:35,858
<b>Will you...</b>

216
00:22:36,358 --> 00:22:37,659
<b>get rid of me?</b>

217
00:22:48,969 --> 00:22:52,179
<b>Goodbye, my early 20s.</b>

218
00:22:58,818 --> 00:23:01,578
<b>(I'm so happy. It's exciting. Let's not forget today.)</b>

219
00:23:01,578 --> 00:23:03,889
<b>We'll walk you to the bus stop.</b>

220
00:23:04,348 --> 00:23:05,919
<b>Let's just part ways at the gate.</b>

221
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:07,689
<b>We'll walk you there.</b>

222
00:23:07,689 --> 00:23:09,159
<b>Then I won't visit you.</b>

223
00:23:09,389 --> 00:23:10,689
<b>Darn it.</b>

224
00:23:11,588 --> 00:23:13,798
<b>Why isn't Seo Woo here yet?</b>

225
00:23:13,899 --> 00:23:15,528
<b>Let's go to the bus stop together.</b>

226
00:23:15,528 --> 00:23:16,768
<b>No, it's fine.</b>

227
00:23:16,768 --> 00:23:18,739
<b>Let's say bye in front of Eunjoo Homestay.</b>

228
00:23:19,169 --> 00:23:22,108
<b>See me off with a lighthearted "See you soon."</b>

229
00:23:22,108 --> 00:23:23,739
<b>Like it's no big deal.</b>

230
00:23:24,268 --> 00:23:26,778
<b>Like, "See you when you get back from the market."</b>

231
00:23:31,078 --> 00:23:32,879
<b>She seems anxious.</b>

232
00:23:33,449 --> 00:23:34,749
<b>Min Jung.</b>

233
00:23:36,348 --> 00:23:37,518
<b>Let me give you a hug.</b>

234
00:23:37,818 --> 00:23:38,959
<b>No.</b>

235
00:23:53,969 --> 00:23:54,969
<b>Okay.</b>

236
00:23:55,909 --> 00:23:56,969
<b>I'll get going.</b>

237
00:24:07,979 --> 00:24:09,018
<b>I'm scared.</b>

238
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:14,618
<b>You'll come visit on your days off, right?</b>

239
00:24:14,719 --> 00:24:16,758
<b>Text me the day before.</b>

240
00:24:16,758 --> 00:24:19,159
<b>I'll cook something good. Eat with us!</b>

241
00:24:19,159 --> 00:24:21,699
<b>I'll buy yummier food, so you have to come!</b>

242
00:24:21,858 --> 00:24:22,899
<b>You have to!</b>

243
00:24:24,169 --> 00:24:25,229
<b>I'm fine.</b>

244
00:24:26,068 --> 00:24:27,499
<b>Tell Eun Joo I'm fine.</b>

245
00:24:28,768 --> 00:24:30,368
<b>Come by now and then.</b>

246
00:24:31,239 --> 00:24:34,179
<b>Come and rest, and eat some good food.</b>

247
00:24:35,139 --> 00:24:36,709
<b>Don't cry like a fool.</b>

248
00:24:37,548 --> 00:24:38,649
<b>Good luck with your relationship.</b>

249
00:24:39,419 --> 00:24:40,419
<b>Thank you.</b>

250
00:24:42,749 --> 00:24:44,048
<b>Don't worry!</b>

251
00:24:44,889 --> 00:24:46,618
<b>Don't worry about a thing!</b>

252
00:24:48,118 --> 00:24:49,159
<b>Be brave!</b>

253
00:24:50,389 --> 00:24:51,389
<b>Be brave!</b>

254
00:24:53,258 --> 00:24:54,358
<b>Be brave!</b>

255
00:24:58,739 --> 00:25:01,399
<b>That's it. That's Eunjoo Homestay.</b>

256
00:25:02,538 --> 00:25:04,768
<b>You've given me courage.</b>

257
00:25:09,808 --> 00:25:10,808
<b>Eun Joo,</b>

258
00:25:11,949 --> 00:25:14,949
<b>I'll be strong from now on.</b>

259
00:25:32,368 --> 00:25:34,969
<b>Will you get rid of me?</b>

260
00:25:36,239 --> 00:25:38,778
<b>I shouldn't be here.</b>

261
00:25:39,439 --> 00:25:41,679
<b>- Get rid of me. - How...</b>

262
00:25:43,209 --> 00:25:44,308
<b>could I...</b>

263
00:25:44,508 --> 00:25:46,449
<b>If you can't, ask Won...</b>

264
00:25:46,449 --> 00:25:47,479
<b>No.</b>

265
00:25:49,489 --> 00:25:51,449
<b>He can't lose you again.</b>

266
00:25:53,689 --> 00:25:54,788
<b>He just can't.</b>

267
00:25:55,018 --> 00:25:57,659
<b>Yes, I think so too.</b>

268
00:26:01,129 --> 00:26:02,129
<b>I will...</b>

269
00:26:03,368 --> 00:26:04,429
<b>do it.</b>

270
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:10,568
<b>I'll get rid of you...</b>

271
00:26:13,239 --> 00:26:14,739
<b>so you can't talk to anyone.</b>

272
00:26:16,778 --> 00:26:19,578
<b>I know it'll be hard, but please do it for me.</b>

273
00:26:20,348 --> 00:26:22,649
<b>I remember when I first met you.</b>

274
00:26:24,348 --> 00:26:25,518
<b>When I was at my lowest.</b>

275
00:26:26,818 --> 00:26:29,258
<b>I was walking up the hill carrying the plates,</b>

276
00:26:29,989 --> 00:26:32,459
<b>and you were standing way up ahead.</b>

277
00:26:33,399 --> 00:26:35,768
<b>That was the first time I realized what it means when they say...</b>

278
00:26:35,828 --> 00:26:37,199
<b>someone glows.</b>

279
00:26:37,229 --> 00:26:38,328
<b>Ms. Kim Ji Soo?</b>

280
00:26:38,528 --> 00:26:41,538
<b>Way at the end of the road, glowing brightly.</b>

281
00:26:41,739 --> 00:26:43,108
<b>I was so grateful...</b>

282
00:26:44,338 --> 00:26:46,179
<b>and I didn't want them to break.</b>

283
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:49,209
<b>You were holding the door open.</b>

284
00:26:52,249 --> 00:26:53,649
<b>I'm so grateful for you, Seo Woo.</b>

285
00:26:55,018 --> 00:26:56,318
<b>Get rid of me...</b>

286
00:26:57,348 --> 00:26:58,449
<b>and forget me.</b>

287
00:27:01,258 --> 00:27:02,258
<b>Goodbye.</b>

288
00:27:47,699 --> 00:27:50,768
<b>I... I can't do it right now.</b>

289
00:27:50,969 --> 00:27:52,639
<b>What am I saying?</b>

290
00:27:54,008 --> 00:27:55,038
<b>I can't look at you.</b>

291
00:27:55,038 --> 00:27:56,578
<b>- Seo Woo. - I can't...</b>

292
00:27:57,249 --> 00:27:58,848
<b>look at you right now.</b>

293
00:27:59,749 --> 00:28:00,818
<b>Have a nice day.</b>

294
00:28:38,048 --> 00:28:40,358
<b>(Before Dawn)</b>

295
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:27,459
<b>Are you happy to see me?</b>

296
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:29,568
<b>I bet you're very happy to see me.</b>

297
00:30:34,298 --> 00:30:37,038
<b>We parted ways and were reunited after 35 minutes.</b>

298
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:40,679
<b>I guess we can part ways with a "Have a nice day."</b>

299
00:31:25,959 --> 00:31:28,018
<b>You're not bothered by what Kang In Wook said, are you?</b>

300
00:31:29,989 --> 00:31:32,058
<b>I'm not influenced by what other people say.</b>

301
00:31:33,959 --> 00:31:35,229
<b>It doesn't bother me.</b>

302
00:31:49,848 --> 00:31:51,949
<b>Your arm will go numb.</b>

303
00:31:54,719 --> 00:31:56,018
<b>It's the perfect weight.</b>

304
00:31:57,118 --> 00:31:58,449
<b>I'm falling asleep.</b>

305
00:32:14,469 --> 00:32:20,139
<b>You smiled</b>

306
00:32:23,108 --> 00:32:26,979
<b>And said to me</b>

307
00:32:27,818 --> 00:32:30,788
<b>I want to fly</b>

308
00:32:38,689 --> 00:32:39,758
<b>Seo Woo.</b>

<b>I'm okay.</b>

310
00:32:43,469 --> 00:32:45,229
<b>I'm just...</b>

311
00:32:46,439 --> 00:32:48,739
<b>very confused right now.</b>

312
00:32:50,568 --> 00:32:52,608
<b>I think I'm weird too.</b>

313
00:32:56,008 --> 00:32:58,078
<b>I feel like the person who saved Kang In Wook...</b>

314
00:33:00,078 --> 00:33:01,848
<b>was you, Ha Won.</b>

315
00:33:02,749 --> 00:33:03,788
<b>And that...</b>

316
00:33:04,788 --> 00:33:06,258
<b>makes me so sad for you.</b>

317
00:33:07,989 --> 00:33:09,159
<b>It's just so sad.</b>

318
00:33:09,159 --> 00:33:12,058
<b>I shouldn't be here.</b>

319
00:33:12,929 --> 00:33:13,999
<b>Get rid of me.</b>

320
00:33:15,058 --> 00:33:16,068

00:50:31,415 --> 00:50:34,446
<b>It's just Seo Woo's voice.</b>

482
00:50:35,946 --> 00:50:38,986
<b>This isn't Seo Woo yet.</b>

483
00:50:40,426 --> 00:50:41,455
<b>Excuse me.</b>

484
00:50:42,255 --> 00:50:43,455
<b>It hasn't reached the point of reaction.</b>

485
00:50:46,725 --> 00:50:47,966
<b>What did she like?</b>

486
00:50:50,395 --> 00:50:51,496
<b>Eunjoo Homestay.</b>

<b>Searching for information on "Eunjoo Homestay".</b>

488
00:51:00,946 --> 00:51:02,005
<b>Grandma?</b>

489
00:51:13,185 --> 00:51:14,225
<b>Hello.</b>

490
00:51:15,926 --> 00:51:17,225
<b>Why are you so shocked?</b>

491
00:51:18,025 --> 00:51:20,996
<b>You shouldn't touch that.</b>

492
00:51:22,266 --> 00:51:24,565
<b>I learned how to turn it on and off.</b>

493
00:51:25,536 --> 00:51:27,005
<b>I started studying acoustics.</b>

494
00:51:27,105 --> 00:51:29,266
<b>I'll watch your practice today.</b>

495
00:51:30,105 --> 00:51:31,406
<b>You'll watch it?</b>

496
00:51:31,975 --> 00:51:33,406
<b>I'll watch with my eyes.</b>

497
00:51:33,846 --> 00:51:35,775
<b>The line-up for the recital is insane.</b>

498
00:51:35,775 --> 00:51:37,746
<b>- You'll have to practice hard. - Did you...</b>

499
00:51:39,545 --> 00:51:41,216
<b>decide to come back to the studio?</b>

500
00:51:41,786 --> 00:51:43,246
<b>Did I ever quit?</b>

501
00:51:44,085 --> 00:51:46,355
<b>If I were going to quit because of something like that,</b>

502
00:51:46,355 --> 00:51:47,886
<b>I shouldn't have started at all.</b>

503
00:51:49,585 --> 00:51:51,125
<b>I'll study hard...</b>

504

<b>and assist Seo Woo when we record your next album.</b>

505
00:51:55,295 --> 00:51:56,966
<b>It takes about two years to make an album, right?</b>

506
00:51:57,366 --> 00:51:59,996
<b>I don't work with people who don't know music.</b>

507
00:52:01,705 --> 00:52:03,205
<b>I'll have to study music as well.</b>

508
00:52:03,705 --> 00:52:04,835
<b>I have my work cut out for me.</b>

509
00:52:06,076 --> 00:52:09,475
<b>How about a bet to see whether you finish your album first...</b>

510
00:52:09,475 --> 00:52:11,815
<b>or I finish my studies first?</b>

511
00:52:16,915 --> 00:52:18,116
<b>I'm saying, let's do our best.</b>

512
00:52:26,725 --> 00:52:30,025
<b>Hey. I did as Seo Woo said.</b>

513
00:52:30,835 --> 00:52:33,496
<b>- But it won't work. - Why aren't you coming to visit?</b>

514
00:52:33,906 --> 00:52:35,505
<b>Are you coming this week or not?</b>

515
00:52:36,105 --> 00:52:37,605
<b>You're working yourself to death again, aren't you?</b>

516
00:52:37,975 --> 00:52:39,176
<b>Okay, I'll go.</b>

517
00:52:39,835 --> 00:52:41,806
<b>- Ask her for me. - Okay, hold on.</b>

518
00:52:44,946 --> 00:52:48,286
<b>Seo Woo. She's asking...</b>

519
00:52:48,286 --> 00:52:50,415
<b>if you can think of something else.</b>

520
00:52:51,085 --> 00:52:52,085
<b>I don't know.</b>

521
00:52:53,286 --> 00:52:54,525
<b>She doesn't know either.</b>

522
00:52:55,085 --> 00:52:56,685
<b>- What could it be? - What?</b>

523
00:52:57,395 --> 00:52:58,395
<b>What was that?</b>

524
00:52:59,826 --> 00:53:01,096
<b>Sunset in Misiryeong.</b>

525
00:53:05,266 --> 00:53:06,935
<b>I'm memorizing it.</b>

526
00:53:08,736 --> 00:53:09,835
<b>Who's that?</b>

527
00:53:12,775 --> 00:53:14,076
<b>We got cut off.</b>

528
00:53:14,145 --> 00:53:17,275
<b>Hey you. Who's Before Dawn?</b>

529
00:53:17,516 --> 00:53:19,176
<b>Searching...</b>

530
00:53:20,246 --> 00:53:21,746
<b>Min Jung.</b>

531
00:53:23,986 --> 00:53:26,016
<b>She's here.</b>

532
00:53:26,486 --> 00:53:28,886
<b>She's... Excuse me.</b>

533
00:53:30,025 --> 00:53:32,326
<b>She's here.</b>

534
00:53:32,926 --> 00:53:34,996
<b>Seo Woo's here. Do you want to talk to her?</b>

535
00:53:34,996 --> 00:53:36,125
<b>Really?</b>

536
00:53:36,125 --> 00:53:37,196
<b>Before Dawn.</b>

537
00:53:39,565 --> 00:53:43,536
<b>Before Dawn puts Seo Woo together.</b>

538
00:53:44,536 --> 00:53:45,676
<b>Makes sense.</b>

539
00:53:46,736 --> 00:53:48,045
<b>Who's that?</b>

540
00:53:49,846 --> 00:53:50,875
<b>Just someone.</b>

541
00:53:59,886 --> 00:54:00,955
<b>This way.</b>

542
00:54:01,725 --> 00:54:02,986
<b>Stay.</b>

543
00:54:04,125 --> 00:54:05,625
<b>When Seo Woo was at her lowest...</b>

544
00:54:05,625 --> 00:54:08,665
<b>Time can't erase the moment you first met them.</b>

545
00:54:08,665 --> 00:54:11,636
<b>People like that tend to remain in my life for a long time.</b>

546
00:54:11,996 --> 00:54:13,496
<b>The person who pulled her up.</b>

547
00:54:13,496 --> 00:54:15,105
<b>It's me. Before Dawn.</b>

548
00:54:15,105 --> 00:54:16,435
<b>Before Dawn.</b>

549
00:54:16,835 --> 00:54:18,136
<b>Goodbye.</b>

550
00:54:18,576 --> 00:54:20,076
<b>Thank you.</b>

551
00:54:24,775 --> 00:54:27,315
<b>The thing you said you liked looking at...</b>

552
00:54:28,386 --> 00:54:29,585
<b>You don't mean...</b>

553
00:54:29,585 --> 00:54:31,556
<b>- Me? - We miss each other.</b>

554
00:54:31,556 --> 00:54:33,516
<b>We want to be with each other.</b>

555
00:54:33,716 --> 00:54:35,156
<b>We want to hold hands.</b>

556
00:54:35,225 --> 00:54:36,386
<b>Please stay.</b>

557
00:54:38,725 --> 00:54:40,596
<b>I'll get better.</b>

558
00:54:41,665 --> 00:54:43,496
<b>I'll get better.</b>

559
00:54:44,935 --> 00:54:47,065
<b>I like 17°C the best.</b>

560
00:54:47,665 --> 00:54:49,435
<b>It's the best for taking walks.</b>

561
00:54:50,036 --> 00:54:52,505
<b>It's the perfect temperature to recover.</b>

562
00:54:53,835 --> 00:54:55,205
<b>Why don't you live here?</b>

563
00:54:56,375 --> 00:54:58,116
<b>Come here after work.</b>

564
00:54:59,446 --> 00:55:01,616
<b>I'll be here when you return.</b>

565
00:55:02,915 --> 00:55:05,085
<b>When I come, you'll be here.</b>

566
00:55:09,556 --> 00:55:11,196
<b>The person who can say,</b>

567
00:55:11,625 --> 00:55:13,255
<b>"I pulled Seo Woo up..."</b>

568

<b>"when she was at her lowest."</b>

569
00:55:18,766 --> 00:55:19,935
<b>What's this?</b>

570
00:55:19,935 --> 00:55:22,036
<b>Points of reaction are complicated,</b>

571
00:55:22,136 --> 00:55:23,505
<b>but it can be explained by one thing.</b>

572
00:55:23,505 --> 00:55:24,736
<b>Isn't it amazing?</b>

573
00:55:24,736 --> 00:55:27,306
<b>Just as failure leads to success,</b>

574
00:55:27,306 --> 00:55:29,746
<b>it's like the two sides of a coin.</b>

575
00:55:29,846 --> 00:55:32,375
<b>It's alluring. It's intriguing.</b>

576
00:55:32,375 --> 00:55:33,375
<b>Like the thunder.</b>

577
00:55:34,486 --> 00:55:36,216
<b>Think about it again starting with that.</b>

578
00:55:41,025 --> 00:55:42,386
<b>It's thundering.</b>

579
00:55:43,926 --> 00:55:45,596
<b>Ji Soo used to get scared.</b>

580
00:55:46,625 --> 00:55:47,766
<b>Piano.</b>

581
00:55:49,295 --> 00:55:50,295
<b>How is it?</b>

582
00:55:50,835 --> 00:55:51,835
<b>Should we add some pepper?</b>

583
00:55:51,835 --> 00:55:53,435
<b>Should we? Okay.</b>

584
00:55:55,205 --> 00:55:58,676
<b>Ji Soo. You should listen as you play.</b>

585
00:55:59,536 --> 00:56:00,645
<b>Thunder.</b>

586
00:56:03,545 --> 00:56:05,375
<b>The thunder is so loud.</b>

587
00:56:13,216 --> 00:56:14,355
<b>Mom.</b>

588
00:56:16,125 --> 00:56:17,426
<b>It's thundering.</b>

589
00:56:22,395 --> 00:56:25,036
<b>Your mom plays the piano whenever it thunders...</b>

590
00:56:25,196 --> 00:56:26,766
<b>so you won't get scared.</b>

591
00:57:23,486 --> 00:57:25,955
<b>I got to know someone that precious.</b>

592
00:57:26,926 --> 00:57:29,225
<b>Shouldn't I change somehow?</b>

593
00:57:31,036 --> 00:57:32,766
<b>If I never met Seo Woo,</b>

594
00:57:34,406 --> 00:57:36,205
<b>I never would've had the courage to even try.</b>

595
00:57:46,378 --> 00:57:48,117
<b>- Eun Joo. - Hey.</b>

596
00:57:49,288 --> 00:57:51,018
<b>I love the walk home.</b>

597
00:57:51,058 --> 00:57:52,788
<b>I'm so glad I moved back.</b>

598
00:57:54,188 --> 00:57:56,328
<b>- Did you eat? - Of course.</b>

599
00:57:56,328 --> 00:57:58,757
<b>Good. Go in first.</b>

600
00:57:58,757 --> 00:58:00,867
<b>I'll go in once Seo Woo comes.</b>

601
00:58:00,867 --> 00:58:03,297
<b>She's been too down lately.</b>

602
00:58:03,297 --> 00:58:04,637
<b>- Okay. - Okay.</b>

603

<b>Me too.</b>

607

<b>Let's go home.</b>

608
00:58:56,288 --> 00:58:57,317
<b>Hey.</b>

609
00:58:57,887 --> 00:58:59,918
<b>When did you draw the heart?</b>

610
00:59:00,157 --> 00:59:01,487
<b>- Heart? - Yes.</b>

611
00:59:01,487 --> 00:59:02,858
<b>There's a heart?</b>

612
00:59:03,328 --> 00:59:05,157
<b>- It wasn't you? - What?</b>

613
00:59:05,597 --> 00:59:06,597
<b>It wasn't you?</b>

614
00:59:06,597 --> 00:59:08,367
<b>What heart?</b>

615
00:59:09,567 --> 00:59:10,567
<b>This.</b>

616
00:59:10,768 --> 00:59:12,938
<b>No, that wasn't me.</b>

617

<b>- It wasn't? - No.</b>

618
00:59:15,268 --> 00:59:16,367
<b>Who was it?</b>

619
00:59:16,407 --> 00:59:17,838
<b>I think I know.</b>

<b>Eun Joo. Do...</b>

623
00:59:59,518 --> 01:00:02,317
<b>Do you have a hammer or something like that?</b>

624
01:00:02,317 --> 01:00:03,317
<b>Why?</b>

625
01:00:04,088 --> 01:00:06,487
<b>I need to get rid of something.</b>

626
01:00:06,958 --> 01:00:09,728
<b>I think breaking it will be the least...</b>

627
01:00:09,728 --> 01:00:11,398
<b>- Get rid of what? - Well...</b>

628
01:00:11,858 --> 01:00:12,858
<b>So...</b>

629
01:00:13,297 --> 01:00:15,228
<b>I was asked by someone.</b>

630
01:00:15,228 --> 01:00:16,998
<b>Who asked you to do something so horrible?</b>

631
01:00:17,328 --> 01:00:18,538
<b>Don't do it.</b>

632

<b>You're trembling already.</b>

<b>Don't listen to jerks who ask for bad favors.</b>

635

<b>It's not like that.</b>

636
01:00:27,507 --> 01:00:28,547
<b>Don't do it.</b>

637

01:00:43,157 --> 01:00:44,458
<b>but let's eat it now.</b>

641
01:00:50,128 --> 01:00:52,768
<b>Let's stop putting meaning behind eating certain foods,</b>

642
01:00:53,867 --> 01:00:55,808
<b>and just eat them when we want.</b>

643
01:01:05,047 --> 01:01:06,947
<b>If you think you're alone,</b>

644
01:01:06,947 --> 01:01:09,588
<b>you'll become weak and controlled by people.</b>

645
01:01:09,887 --> 01:01:11,518
<b>You're not alone.</b>

646
01:01:11,788 --> 01:01:15,588
<b>Call out everyone who loved you, everyone who loves you now,</b>

647
01:01:15,588 --> 01:01:18,027
<b>and everyone who will love you in the future.</b>

648
01:01:18,927 --> 01:01:20,257
<b>Don't you feel secure then?</b>

649
01:01:21,668 --> 01:01:23,927
<b>You can't become weak.</b>

650
01:01:23,927 --> 01:01:26,967
<b>You, Han Seo Woo, think about Han Seo Woo the most.</b>

651
01:01:26,967 --> 01:01:28,168
<b>You have yourself.</b>

652
01:01:28,168 --> 01:01:30,978
<b>You're precious to yourself. So why are you doing this?</b>

653
01:01:31,338 --> 01:01:33,338
<b>Why are you harming yourself when you're so precious?</b>

654
01:01:34,748 --> 01:01:37,248
<b>Eat this, and be strong.</b>

655
01:01:37,677 --> 01:01:39,578
<b>Give me the number of the person who asked you for the favor.</b>

656
01:01:39,578 --> 01:01:41,817
<b>I'll give them a serious talking to.</b>

657
01:01:41,847 --> 01:01:45,418
<b>They should destroy it themselves. Why are they doing this to you?</b>

658
01:01:45,887 --> 01:01:47,018
<b>Don't do it.</b>

659
01:01:51,858 --> 01:01:53,157
<b>I won't.</b>

660
01:01:56,828 --> 01:01:58,797
<b>Come to think of it, I don't have to.</b>

661
01:02:02,237 --> 01:02:04,478
<b>I must have lost my mind.</b>

662
01:02:04,538 --> 01:02:06,578
<b>Hey. You can't eat this then.</b>

663
01:02:07,038 --> 01:02:09,608
<b>No. These are tears of enlightenment.</b>

664
01:02:09,608 --> 01:02:10,978
<b>Tears of joy.</b>

665
01:02:13,748 --> 01:02:14,817
<b>Eat.</b>

666
01:02:16,547 --> 01:02:17,958
<b>My precious Seo Woo.</b>

667
01:02:48,188 --> 01:02:51,387
<b>I refuse your request to get rid of you.</b>

668
01:02:52,688 --> 01:02:55,858
<b>In exchange, I'll put you someplace where no one can find you.</b>

669
01:02:57,487 --> 01:02:59,898
<b>I also refuse your request to forget you.</b>

670
01:03:03,697 --> 01:03:04,838
<b>I'm going to remember you.</b>

671
01:03:18,578 --> 01:03:20,177
<b>It's your favorite weather.</b>

672
01:03:20,447 --> 01:03:23,117
<b>Sprout, and grow healthy and strong.</b>

673
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:45,308
<b>You're saying bye to so many people recently.</b>

674
01:03:47,907 --> 01:03:49,547
<b>I'm sure there's a meaning to it all.</b>

675
01:03:50,407 --> 01:03:52,248
<b>Of course there is. A precious person came and left.</b>

676
01:03:52,817 --> 01:03:54,418
<b>That's why Uncle left too.</b>

677
01:03:57,217 --> 01:03:58,257
<b>Where?</b>

678
01:04:01,128 --> 01:04:02,858
<b>He went there.</b>

679
01:04:03,958 --> 01:04:06,657
<b>Courageously. While thinking of you.</b>

680
01:04:07,527 --> 01:04:08,527
<b>Where is that?</b>

681
01:04:08,527 --> 01:04:10,367
<b>I never knew he'd go there.</b>

682
01:04:10,367 --> 01:04:12,797
<b>He didn't have to, but he insisted.</b>

683
01:04:13,097 --> 01:04:14,808
<b>I was against it. I asked why he had to go.</b>

684
01:04:14,808 --> 01:04:16,038
<b>Where did he go?</b>

685
01:04:21,748 --> 01:04:25,078
<b>The place I wouldn't have been able to go to...</b>

686
01:04:26,078 --> 01:04:27,478
<b>if I didn't have Ha Won.</b>

687
01:04:30,648 --> 01:04:32,058
<b>I'm back.</b>

688
01:04:33,188 --> 01:04:35,757
<b>Mom. Dad.</b>

689
01:04:57,947 --> 01:04:59,677
<b>I think I know where.</b>

690
01:08:10,138 --> 01:08:11,208
<b>I'm back.</b>

691
01:08:46,708 --> 01:08:49,208
<b>You smiled</b>

692
01:08:49,407 --> 01:08:52,017
<b>And said to me</b>

693
01:08:57,017 --> 01:09:00,617
<b>I want to fly</b>

694
01:09:01,588 --> 01:09:04,628
<b>Like a bird</b>

695
01:12:19,588 --> 01:12:22,527
<b>(Han Seo Woo)</b>

696
01:12:29,527 --> 01:12:35,208
<b>(Han Seo Woo)</b>

697
01:12:39,638 --> 01:12:40,678
<b>Hello?</b>

698
01:12:46,718 --> 01:12:48,348
<b>What do you see?</b>

699
01:12:56,527 --> 01:12:57,588
<b>The sky.</b>

700
01:13:01,098 --> 01:13:04,168
<b>What are you looking at?</b>

701
01:13:05,237 --> 01:13:06,838
<b>The night sky.</b>

702
01:13:07,697 --> 01:13:08,838
<b>The front yard.</b>

703
01:13:10,208 --> 01:13:11,578
<b>The clothesline.</b>

704
01:13:12,338 --> 01:13:13,607
<b>You're at the house.</b>

705
01:13:14,737 --> 01:13:16,548
<b>You sound better.</b>

706
01:13:18,317 --> 01:13:20,947
<b>I recovered a little after coming here.</b>

707
01:13:22,248 --> 01:13:26,057
<b>And I heard your voice right now only briefly, but I'm much better.</b>

708
01:13:26,788 --> 01:13:29,657
<b>I can't even remember when I was sad.</b>

709
01:13:30,227 --> 01:13:32,657
<b>Even the voice by itself is effective.</b>

710
01:13:33,098 --> 01:13:34,357
<b>It's more than enough.</b>

711
01:13:34,697 --> 01:13:37,197
<b>You'll be all better once you see me.</b>

712
01:13:37,998 --> 01:13:39,168
<b>A full recovery.</b>

713
01:13:41,968 --> 01:13:43,567
<b>I'll have to see you soon.</b>

714
01:13:44,937 --> 01:13:46,638
<b>When can I see you?</b>

715
01:13:48,208 --> 01:13:49,348
<b>Tomorrow.</b>

716
01:13:52,977 --> 01:13:54,048
<b>See you tomorrow.</b>

717
01:13:56,817 --> 01:13:57,987
<b>Tomorrow.</b>

718
01:14:01,088 --> 01:14:02,128
<b>How nice.</b>

719
01:14:38,527 --> 01:14:41,798
<b>Once I get on the plane, I'll be in Korea in half a day.</b>

720
01:14:48,638 --> 01:14:50,638
<b>I'll be there in two hours.</b>

721
01:15:03,248 --> 01:15:05,117
<b>I'll be there in 15 minutes.</b>

722
01:15:42,128 --> 01:15:43,388
<b>You're here.</b>

723
01:15:45,128 --> 01:15:46,498
<b>I'm back.</b>

724
01:16:14,288 --> 01:16:16,628
<b>(Thank you for watching "A Piece of Your Mind")</b>

725
01:16:58,437 --> 01:17:00,638
<b>(A Piece of Your Mind)</b>

726
01:17:26,357 --> 01:17:27,697
<b>Did you see the moon?</b>

727
01:17:29,067 --> 01:17:31,027
<b>- It's huge. - Right?</b>

728
01:17:33,338 --> 01:17:36,008
<b>- Isn't it pretty? - It's super bright.</b>
