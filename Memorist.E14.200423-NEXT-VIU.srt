<b>The first thing I realized after scanning Jin Jae Gyu's memory...</b>

3
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:01,130
<b>is that throughout his 57-year-long life,</b>

4
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:02,890
<b>he was happy...</b>

5
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:05,400
<b>only for a few years.</b>

6

<b>The only time he was truly happy...</b>

7

<b>was when he was a little boy.</b>

8

<b>Why must you kill the goat?</b>

9

<b>To save others.</b>

10

<b>How can it when it's dead?</b>

11
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,300
<b>It'll be offered as a sacrifice to save people.</b>

12

<b>Are you saying that a human's life is more precious than an animal's?</b>

27

34

<b>- Mom! - The spirit she served...</b>

35

<b>What did I tell you? I said I wasn't going to marry!</b>

<b>He's an elite prosecutor...</b>

47

<b>That shaman brat?</b>

56
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:52,740
<b>Because of the hospital director you bribed,</b>

57

<b>I spent 15 years locked up in a mental institution.</b>

60

<b>- I had no choice. - Nonsense!</b>

62
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,430
<b>There seems to be a terrible mistake...</b>

63
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:10,130
<b>The gunshot was loud.</b>

64
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,800
<b>Louder than I imagined.</b>

65
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:22,570
<b>All I have left is one bullet.</b>

66
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,000
<b>I want to live.</b>

67
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:49,230
<b>I want to forget my past and live a normal life.</b>

68

00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:29,070

72
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:31,270
<b>What is this?</b>

73
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:37,380
<b>Father.</b>

74
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,850

75
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:47,020
<b>Father...</b>

76
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,840
<b>What did you do?</b>

77
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,230
<b>It took me too long to figure this out.</b>

78
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:29,130
<b>Why was the Eraser obsessed with having...</b>

79
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:30,600
<b>Jin Jae Gyu as his partner?</b>

80
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,040
<b>It was because they had a common enemy.</b>

81
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,140
<b>The one who started it all.</b>

82
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,610
<b>Hwang Pil Seon.</b>

83
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:10,210
<b>You people...</b>

84
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,310
<b>are in big trouble.</b>

85
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,610
<b>What do you think you're doing?</b>

86
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:20,480
<b>Did you know that the Eraser is after you?</b>

87
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:22,750
<b>Don't tell them everything.</b>

88
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,690
<b>What do you mean?</b>

89
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:28,160
<b>What do I mean?</b>

90
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:30,960
<b>I'm saying that we're in this mess because someone committed murder...</b>

91

<b>20 years ago while under the influence of drugs.</b>

92
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,000
<b>And then his mother faked a suicide note...</b>

93
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,740
<b>which led to the death of the bereaved.</b>

94
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:43,240
<b>- What the... - It's news to me.</b>

95
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:45,740
<b>You'll play dumb with me?</b>

96
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,780
<b>How dare you.</b>

97
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:54,220
<b>No one has ever raised their voice in front of me before.</b>

98
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:58,120
<b>You'll be experiencing a lot of "firsts" this time.</b>

99
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,620
<b>If you're lucky, you'll go to prison.</b>

100
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,430
<b>If not, the Eraser will end your life.</b>

101
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,460
<b>- Shut your mouth. - Quiet.</b>

102
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,330
<b>Let me get this straight.</b>

103
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,670
<b>The ultimate targets of this so-called Eraser...</b>

104
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:14,970
<b>are me and my son?</b>

105
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:18,580
<b>And that's why he abducted my daughter-in-law.</b>

106
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:20,380
<b>You hit the nail on the head, lady.</b>

107

<b>"Madam Chairman".</b>

108
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:27,420
<b>Even if that were true,</b>

109
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:30,390
<b>why are you bringing up something from 20 years ago?</b>

110
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:32,820
<b>How would I know what a psycho is thinking?</b>

111
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:34,720
<b>He's taking out those below you...</b>

112
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:37,260
<b>so that you two will shudder in fear.</b>

113
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:39,530
<b>Fear?</b>

114
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,730
<b>You know nothing about me.</b>

115
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:47,140
<b>He's killing innocent family members like Ms. Eun Soo Kyung.</b>

116
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:51,110
<b>What are you talking about? We all know it was his fault.</b>

117
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,340
<b>Yes, I'm enemies with the Eraser.</b>

118
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,480
<b>We're dying to kill each other.</b>

119
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,050
<b>Should I be more honest?</b>

120
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,620

123

<b>Especially...</b>

124

<b>his contempt toward you.</b>

125
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:19,240
<b>Because I saw what you did to Jin Jae Gyu.</b>

126
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,610
<b>Hey, you're not making any sense.</b>

127
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:24,980
<b>What? Should I be more honest?</b>

128
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:27,910
<b>I couldn't care less about what will happen to you people.</b>

129

<b>Reputation?</b>

138

<b>Tell me who the Eraser is.</b>

161
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:30,090
<b>Then you will live.</b>

162
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:36,700
<b>I'm already dead. I died 20 years ago.</b>

163
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,270
<b>At the morgue where I saw...</b>

164
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:44,570
<b>my brother's body.</b>

165
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:51,480
<b>No.</b>

166
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,620
<b>Yong Dae...</b>

167
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,050
<b>No.</b>

168
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,560
<b>No, right? Yong Dae.</b>

169
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,790
<b>It can't be.</b>

170
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:07,200
<b>His suicide note that said he died because he was sick of poverty.</b>

171
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:09,830
<b>- No... - Please.</b>

172
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:12,700
<b>Those horrible words made my mom kill herself too.</b>

173
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,570
<b>Honey!</b>

174
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:17,270
<b>Honey.</b>

175
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:19,240
<b>My dad got depressed and left home.</b>

176
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,280
<b>He's probably...</b>

177
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,250
<b>in the bottom of a lake in a mountain somewhere,</b>

178
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,020
<b>unfound and untouched.</b>

179
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:30,450
<b>I had a gut feeling...</b>

180
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:34,160
<b>that the suicide note was forged.</b>

181
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:38,800
<b>If my brother really wrote it,</b>

182
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:42,470
<b>he would've at least left me a message.</b>

183
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,370
<b>Bang Joon Seok killed my brother,</b>

184
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:50,440
<b>but you killed the rest of my family. All three of us.</b>

185
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:52,710
<b>But what? You'll let me live?</b>

186
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,180
<b>How?</b>

187
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:57,910
<b>I already died 20 years ago, so how?</b>

188
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:03,890
<b>You found out everything,</b>

189
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:06,560
<b>but you let Bang Joon Seok live?</b>

190
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:09,830
<b>That rat can't die a comfortable death.</b>

191
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,500
<b>Same goes for your son.</b>

192
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:19,600
<b>- What? - Did you think he missed...</b>

193
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,140
<b>the vital points out of luck?</b>

194
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:24,610
<b>It's just the beginning...</b>

195
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:27,410
<b>for your son.</b>

196
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:37,220
<b>Who's the Eraser?</b>

197
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,060
<b>I don't know.</b>

198
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:44,330
<b>My memory has been erased.</b>

199
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:56,370
<b>Fine.</b>

200
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:58,780
<b>You...</b>

201
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,940
<b>need to die.</b>

202
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:03,450
<b>Oh, I see.</b>

203
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,750
<b>Will you kill me yourself?</b>

204
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:44,040
<b>Please let me see him for a minute.</b>

205
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,850
<b>You can't.</b>

206
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:47,950
<b>This isn't right.</b>

207
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:49,780
<b>You should let me see him.</b>

208
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:51,580
<b>You said you weren't in any relationship.</b>

209
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,630
<b>Where's the Eraser?</b>

210
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:13,940
<b>Did you enjoy the show?</b>

211
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:18,210
<b>Did you enjoy watching your son burn to death?</b>

212
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:22,150
<b>- What? - Well,</b>

213
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:24,920
<b>my brother...</b>

214
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:27,650
<b>was also burned and pushed off a cliff.</b>

215
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:30,860
<b>The Eraser said he'd do the opposite.</b>

216
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:33,790
<b>He said he'll make you hit rock bottom first,</b>

217
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,930
<b>then he'll burn you to kill you slowly.</b>

218
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:41,470
<b>He said it would be lame if you died too quickly.</b>

219
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:44,670
<b>Die.</b>

220
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:50,510
<b>I didn't want to say this,</b>

221
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,280
<b>but he's a murder suspect.</b>

222
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:57,180
<b>Bring a lawyer. You can't see him otherwise.</b>

223
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:03,760
<b>Why are you out here? What about Moon Yong Gang?</b>

224
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:05,660
<b>The Intelligence Bureau is standing guard.</b>

225
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:08,760
<b>- What? - They don't have jurisdiction.</b>

226
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:12,330
<b>Chief Byun.</b>

227
00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:18,240
<b>Long time no see.</b>

228
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:20,670
<b>What brings you here all the way from the Intelligence Department?</b>

229
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:24,180
<b>- Can we talk? - Maybe next time.</b>

230
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:25,650
<b>Check the patient's room.</b>

231
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:26,880
<b>- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.</b>

232
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:28,650
<b>It's the deputy chief's orders.</b>

233
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,090
<b>The director and deputy chief are both upstairs.</b>

234
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:35,460
<b>We'll be out of your hair soon, so give us a few minutes.</b>

235
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:36,690
<b>He's being interrogated.</b>

236
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,090
<b>By whom?</b>

237
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,330
<b>Corporal Chun Ki Soo from headquarters.</b>

238
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,700
<b>Just act like you don't know anything.</b>

239
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,570
<b>You let the victim's family meet the suspect?</b>

240
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:50,570
<b>Young Soo, you also work for the deputy chief.</b>

241
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:51,600
<b>What's the matter with you?</b>

242
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:56,240
<b>I don't work for him.</b>

243
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,710
<b>We just need to do what we're told.</b>

244
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,210
<b>Check the patient!</b>

245
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:00,880
<b>- Just push through! - Let's go!</b>

246
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:02,320
<b>Stop them.</b>

247
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,520
<b>- Move! - Get out.</b>

248
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:06,050
<b>Get off!</b>

249
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:13,730
<b>Who is the Eraser?</b>

250
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:20,630
<b>The pain of having lost your son...</b>

251
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:22,740
<b>will only worsen with time.</b>

252
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:27,970
<b>The pain will eat you up...</b>

253
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:32,250
<b>and make you feel miserable.</b>

254
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:35,950
<b>You don't even deserve a trial.</b>

255
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:38,890
<b>I'll just kill you myself.</b>

256
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,370
<b>- Move! - Move back!</b>

257
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,970
<b>- Stop them! - Move!</b>

258
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:59,310
<b>- This way, sir. - Hey, stop!</b>

259
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:00,440
<b>Nothing's going on!</b>

260
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:02,440
<b>(Moon Yong Gang)</b>

261
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,200
<b>- You can go first. - Okay.</b>

262
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,300
<b>My goodness.</b>

263
00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:42,450
<b>Hey, you know I used to serve in the Marine Corps, right?</b>

264
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:44,150
<b>We're known to be very brave.</b>

265
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:46,990
<b>I can even eat a raw snake.</b>

266
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:48,290
<b>Why are you telling me that?</b>

267
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:51,360
<b>Can you look out for mice?</b>

268
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:54,330
<b>I really hate mice because of their long tails.</b>

269
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,030
<b>What about ones that don't have a tail?</b>

270
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:00,600
<b>What about Mickey Mouse?</b>

271
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:03,840
<b>What about Jerry from "Tom and Jerry"?</b>

272
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:06,170
<b>I don't like any of them.</b>

273
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:11,580
<b>Hey, did you hear that?</b>

274
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:18,220
<b>He may be huge, but he's like a little kid.</b>

275
00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:23,090
<b>What's the matter?</b>

276
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,820
<b>He saw a mouse.</b>

277
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,560
<b>I really hate mice. I really do.</b>

278
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,900
<b>- Was anyone following you? - We used an unknown route.</b>

279
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:32,570
<b>No one would know that we used the route created by a murderer.</b>

280
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,630
<b>- And your cell phones? - It's turned off.</b>

281
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:35,900
<b>Are you sure you didn't call your son?</b>

282
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,240
<b>I'm not an amateur. Just worry about yourself.</b>

283
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:49,880
<b>Chairwoman Hwang Pil Seon is the final villain?</b>

284
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:53,050
<b>She even fabricated Moon Yong Dae's death...</b>

285
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:54,490
<b>and led his family to die.</b>

286
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:57,820
<b>Bang Joon Seok was the leader among those eight guys.</b>

287
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:02,830
<b>He was the one who killed Moon Yong Dae.</b>

288
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:05,400
<b>Then why wasn't he at the warehouse?</b>

289
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,400
<b>Hwang Pil Seon sent him to study abroad.</b>

290
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:09,670
<b>What a piece of trash. How could he dream of becoming the president?</b>

291
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:12,740
<b>And Chairwoman Hwang made Deputy Chief Lee...</b>

292
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:14,870
<b>- cover things up. - That's right.</b>

293
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:18,850
<b>I never liked him from the start. He always looked so cunning.</b>

294
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:23,420
<b>Didn't you say he made it that far because of his good looks?</b>

295
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:26,050
<b>I was just saying he had what it takes to succeed.</b>

296
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:27,920
<b>But he has a wicked personality.</b>

297
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:30,020
<b>"Why don't you read my face?"</b>

298
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:32,560
<b>- "Do I have the face of a king?" - Shut it.</b>

299
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:34,830
<b>So now that we know all this, what are we going to do?</b>

300
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,330
<b>We still need to figure some things out.</b>

301
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:39,930
<b>First of all, why did the Eraser wait 20 years?</b>

302
00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:41,230
<b>You're right.</b>

303
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,940
<b>He must've been dying to punish Hwang Pil Seon and her son.</b>

304
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:45,670
<b>But he didn't even do anything.</b>

305
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,570
<b>Do you think he was in jail?</b>

306
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:49,910
<b>- You're clever. - Right?</b>

307
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:51,740
<b>Should I look through the list of ex-convicts?</b>

308
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,910
<b>Second of all, why did Jin Jae Gyu...</b>

309
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:56,550
<b>let Hwang Pil Seon live?</b>

310
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:59,950
<b>Why didn't he kill the woman that killed his own mother?</b>

311
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:04,160
<b>You're right. Then it would've been an execution-style murder.</b>

312
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,260
<b>She's a piece of trash who didn't get punished.</b>

313
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:08,630
<b>Do you think his memory got erased?</b>

314
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:11,430
<b>Or maybe he let her live because she's his stepsister.</b>

315

<b>And here's the most important question of all.</b>

363
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:36,700
<b>What does the Eraser have against them?</b>

364
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,870
<b>We know what Moon Yong Gang has against them.</b>

365
00:28:41,410 --> 00:28:43,380
<b>Bang Joon Seok and his friends killed his older brother.</b>

366

<b>And Hwang Pil Seon fabricated his brother's will...</b>

367
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:47,880
<b>and made his parents die as well.</b>

368
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:51,250
<b>But in the end, the Eraser was the one who took revenge.</b>

369
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:52,690
<b>He took revenge on his behalf.</b>

370
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:55,290
<b>The problem is that we don't know...</b>

371
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:57,890
<b>why the Eraser was so motivated to take revenge.</b>

372
00:28:58,790 --> 00:29:00,490
<b>Are you sure Moon Yong Gang isn't the Eraser?</b>

373
00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:01,930
<b>No.</b>

374
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,530
<b>He showed up after he used him as bait.</b>

375
00:29:07,130 --> 00:29:10,840
<b>That means if we find out why the Eraser took revenge...</b>

376
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,510
<b>We'll be able to find out who he is.</b>

377
00:29:13,570 --> 00:29:15,170
<b>Maybe he's someone who used to know Moon Yong Dae.</b>

378
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:16,740
<b>A friend or something like that.</b>

379
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:19,280
<b>My team is looking into it, but they don't have anything yet.</b>

380
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:21,580
<b>Then why don't we look into Dong Baek?</b>

381
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,080

00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:29,320
<b>We probably won't find anything...</b>

<b>from Detective Dong's childhood at Shimbae.</b>

<b>the telepathic celebrity for over seven years.</b>

387

<b>Where in the world is this guy from?</b>

388
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:38,930
<b>North Korea?</b>

389
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:42,230
<b>That makes sense.</b>

390
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:44,300
<b>- Maybe he was a secret agent. - Yes.</b>

391
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:45,870
<b>We only have one clue.</b>

392
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:47,670
<b>What was our first question?</b>

393
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:49,840
<b>"Why didn't the Eraser do anything for 20 years?"</b>

394
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,480
<b>He waited 20 years to take revenge. That's our clue.</b>

395
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:54,410
<b>So it wasn't because he wanted to take revenge for Moon Yong Dae?</b>

396
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,380
<b>There has to be a bigger resentment.</b>

397
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:59,950
<b>He was extremely patient and put in a lot of work for this revenge.</b>

398
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:02,520
<b>It can't be something that simple.</b>

399
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,490
<b>- Then what do you think... - The Eraser holds...</b>

400
00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:10,700
<b>a deep grudge against Hwang Pil Seon's family.</b>

401
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:12,830
<b>We need to find out what happened between them.</b>

402
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:14,300
<b>Why didn't you tell me earlier?</b>

403
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,700
<b>Then I would've done my best to scan her memory.</b>

404
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:17,870
<b>No more memory scans.</b>

405
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:20,540
<b>Our hands are tied, so what other option do we have?</b>

406
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:22,540
<b>Anything's better than cleaning up a corpse.</b>

407
00:30:22,810 --> 00:30:24,840
<b>- What? - Will someone die?</b>

408
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:27,510
<b>He will if he keeps on scanning memories.</b>

<b>Dr. Ahn is being paranoid, that's all.</b>

410

<b>- Call the medical team. - Got it.</b>

411

<b>Don't do anything silly. We're being wiretapped.</b>

<b>Two photos of the abducted Ms. Eun...</b>

<b>were handed over to the media today.</b>

423
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:08,020
<b>What he wrote is gruesome to even repeat.</b>

424
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:11,260
<b>In the first photo, he wrote that he'd...</b>

425

<b>drive a nail through her every day...</b>

426

<b>until Dong Baek dies.</b>

427
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:16,930
<b>- Mr. Park. - Yes?</b>

428
00:31:16,930 --> 00:31:19,800
<b>Dong Baek must be the telepathic investigator.</b>

429
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:22,800
<b>That is correct. The warning seems to be...</b>

430
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,640
<b>forwarded to Detective Dong.</b>

431
00:31:24,770 --> 00:31:26,570
<b>What about the second photo?</b>

432
00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:28,570
<b>The second photo is too merciless...</b>

433
00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:31,210
<b>to reveal to the public as is.</b>

434
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:33,610
<b>However, since the people have the right to know...</b>

435
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:37,280
<b>Behind us is a blurred photo.</b>

436
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,920
<b>What are we seeing?</b>

437
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,890
<b>It seems to be the photo of Ms. Eun's feet.</b>

438
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:58,870
<b>They're your wife's feet.</b>

439
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,670
<b>Are you sure?</b>

440
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:05,480
<b>My son was assaulted in the same way.</b>

441
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:19,530
<b>The focus of the investigation is naturally shifting toward...</b>

442
00:32:19,530 --> 00:32:21,490
<b>the killer's grudge against Detective Dong.</b>

443
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:23,560
<b>Could it be because...</b>

444
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,930
<b>- of a crime Dong Baek committed? - Scumbags.</b>

445
00:32:24,930 --> 00:32:26,700
<b>It's hard to make that conclusion,</b>

446
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:28,770
<b>but many believe...</b>

447
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:32,540
<b>that Detective Dong earned the wrath of the Eraser.</b>

448
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:36,440
<b>In other words, Detective Dong's actions...</b>

449
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,910
<b>could've led to all these crimes.</b>

450
00:32:39,010 --> 00:32:41,450
<b>That's right. Many are reasonably doubting...</b>

451
00:32:41,650 --> 00:32:45,320
<b>that the Eraser is trying to get revenge against Detective Dong...</b>

452
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:47,690
<b>in the most twisted way.</b>

453
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,960
<b>Even after the first warning,</b>

454
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:52,120
<b>Detective Dong didn't explain himself,</b>

455
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:55,060
<b>which is why many are assuming that he may have...</b>

456
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:57,000
<b>possibly contributed to the Eraser's actions...</b>

457
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,730
<b>or that he's even aiding and abetting...</b>

458
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:02,070
<b>the killer himself.</b>

459
00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:03,940
<b>Nicely put.</b>

460
00:33:03,970 --> 00:33:06,540
<b>He's good, isn't he? He knows how to make it intense.</b>

461
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:09,580
<b>Sources tell us that authorities are speculating...</b>

462

<b>Dong Baek as the Eraser or at least an accomplice.</b>

463
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,210
<b>Citizens are quite baffled...</b>

464
00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:18,050
<b>since Detective Dong has always promoted justice,</b>

465

<b>but is failing to serve it...</b>

466

00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:28,590
<b>Our online bulletin board...</b>

469
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:31,060
<b>is being bombarded with criticism against Dong Baek...</b>

470
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:32,630
<b>- Look at his slimy face. - They also...</b>

471
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:35,170
<b>want the network to release the photos of Ms. Eun.</b>

472
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:38,040
<b>We will dive into it further after the break.</b>

473
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:41,770
<b>They'll do anything to get high ratings, won't they?</b>

474
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:45,640
<b>I don't get it. Why does the Eraser keep provoking Baek?</b>

475
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:48,010
<b>To strike me mentally. He's trying to make me anxious.</b>

476
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:49,450
<b>Are you all right?</b>

477
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:53,320
<b>Of course. If that's how he'll be, we'll take it even slower.</b>

478
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:57,620
<b>Don't they seem to have switched personalities?</b>

479
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,760
<b>Let's get some sleep and head out in the morning.</b>

480
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:03,060
<b>- Head where? - To Hwang Pil Seon.</b>

481
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:05,500
<b>It's just like Ms. Han said. Cracking her will give us...</b>

482
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:06,600
<b>all the answers.</b>

483
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:09,030
<b>The Eraser's grudge and his true identity.</b>

484
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:25,920
<b>What on earth is this?</b>

485
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:30,160
<b>You shouldn't blame yourself.</b>

486
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:34,490
<b>I see you've grown a spine.</b>

487
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:39,970
<b>You have too, thanks to me looking out for you.</b>

488
00:34:47,610 --> 00:34:48,940
<b>But yet you made this mess,</b>

489
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:50,280
<b>because you couldn't handle some telepath.</b>

490
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:55,480
<b>Truth be told, it isn't because of Dong Baek.</b>

491
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:59,350
<b>Your mistake 20 years ago...</b>

492

<b>brought out the devil we know as the Eraser.</b>

493
00:35:11,830 --> 00:35:13,030
<b>I bet you're dizzy.</b>

494
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,930
<b>How can you not be...</b>

495
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:18,840
<b>when you're up somewhere too high for a lapdog?</b>

496
00:35:22,810 --> 00:35:23,880
<b>Mr. Bang.</b>

497
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:28,680
<b>I didn't help you get out of trouble because I'm loyal to you.</b>

498
00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:30,950
<b>It's because I believed it was right.</b>

499
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:33,190
<b>It was the best ending...</b>

500
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:36,420
<b>for the victims and everyone involved.</b>

501
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:41,390
<b>Unfortunately, it just led to some unexpected sacrifices.</b>

502
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:43,830
<b>- So? - I'm saying that loyalty...</b>

503
00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:45,430
<b>isn't most important.</b>

504
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,930
<b>What matters is competence and it's why the chairwoman...</b>

505
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,970
<b>appointed me for the job.</b>

506
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:53,010
<b>Is this what you call competent?</b>

507
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:58,010
<b>You think you have all the power...</b>

508
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,680
<b>just because you have leverage over me.</b>

509
00:36:01,850 --> 00:36:02,920
<b>Of course not.</b>

510
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:05,980
<b>It may sound like a cliche,</b>

511
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:09,190
<b>but I guess you can say our fates are tied.</b>

512
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:13,990
<b>First,</b>

513
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:17,460
<b>I don't care if his wife survives.</b>

514
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:20,230
<b>Mother!</b>

515
00:36:25,770 --> 00:36:26,840
<b>Second,</b>

516
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:30,040
<b>my son...</b>

517
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,840
<b>must not be hurt from this scandal...</b>

518
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:36,050
<b>in any way.</b>

519
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:39,380
<b>You could turn it your advantage.</b>

520
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:42,850
<b>The biggest asset for any politician is sympathy votes.</b>

521
00:36:42,850 --> 00:36:44,420
<b>Shut your incompetent mouth.</b>

522
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:45,790
<b>Third,</b>

523
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:50,700
<b>the killer who knows the truth must not walk into a courtroom.</b>

524
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,260
<b>Never.</b>

525
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:54,130
<b>I'm fully aware of that.</b>

526
00:36:54,330 --> 00:36:55,530
<b>Lastly,</b>

527
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,800
<b>the one being criticized...</b>

528
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:00,270
<b>must be buried too.</b>

529
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:05,010
<b>You mean, Dong Baek.</b>

530
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:08,610
<b>Anyone who can be a threat to my son...</b>

531
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:11,780
<b>must be eliminated.</b>

532
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:16,960
<b>My wife must return safely.</b>

533
00:37:18,290 --> 00:37:21,430
<b>If she doesn't, you'll pay with your life.</b>

534
00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:27,800
<b>I'll do my best.</b>

535
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:34,770
<b>Just so we're clear,</b>

536
00:37:35,310 --> 00:37:37,140
<b>his wife's safe return isn't a concern of mine.</b>

537
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:41,350
<b>I wouldn't mind it going the other way.</b>

538
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:44,820
<b>Keep that in mind.</b>

539
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:48,520
<b>We may not share the same views,</b>

540
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:50,990
<b>but our goal is the same.</b>

541
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:56,060
<b>Eliminating both the Eraser and Dong Baek...</b>

542
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:58,630
<b>is the only way...</b>

543
00:37:59,430 --> 00:38:00,770
<b>to protect our children.</b>

544
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:17,980
<b>Cho Won!</b>

545
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:53,120
<b>How can you eat Dong Baek's as well?</b>

546
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,490
<b>Unbelievable!</b>

547
00:38:57,090 --> 00:38:59,020
<b>Darn.</b>

548
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,240
<b>Going on a midnight run?</b>

549
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:49,240
<b>Did you stay up all night to keep an eye on me?</b>

550
00:39:50,610 --> 00:39:52,880
<b>- I'm a light sleeper. - Please turn a blind eye.</b>

551
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:55,410
<b>Those crushed by the weight of guilt...</b>

552
00:39:55,410 --> 00:39:57,520
<b>jump into the flame of death all by themselves.</b>

553
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,990
<b>- I'm not going to die. - It's not Cho Won.</b>

554
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:04,490
<b>Ms. Eun's unborn baby isn't your old friend.</b>

555

<b>- That's not why... - That's exactly why.</b>

556
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:08,360
<b>You're still haunted by the guilt from seven years ago.</b>

557
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:10,760
<b>I'm only trying to stop others from being hurt because of me.</b>

558
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,400
<b>How is any of this because of you?</b>

559
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,870
<b>He's messing with your head.</b>

560
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,870
<b>- I'll get going. - You'll end up dying.</b>

561
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:16,940
<b>I don't care.</b>

562
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:18,700
<b>I hate others getting hurt because of me even more.</b>

563
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,880
<b>What... What's this?</b>

564
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:25,580
<b>What's going?</b>

565
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,450
<b>Baek. Seriously.</b>

566
00:40:27,850 --> 00:40:30,180
<b>I knew it. I knew he'd do that.</b>

567
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:33,250
<b>People don't change. Good thing we installed that.</b>

568
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:35,550
<b>Cuff him so he can't run away.</b>

<b>Your protagonist syndrome is incurable.</b>

<b>Stay out of it.</b>

573
00:40:43,830 --> 00:40:45,030
<b>You should see Peanut get married.</b>

00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:46,530
<b>Shut it, punk.</b>

575

<b>Even if it's to the fiery pit, we're all going together.</b>

<b>I can live till 100 no problem.</b>

<b>Alfred?</b>

<b>"Alfred"? Isn't that a dog?</b>

584

<b>The butler who guards the house. That's perfect for you.</b>

<b>Let's go to the bat cave. I'll be the commissioner.</b>

<b>Captain, aren't you hungry? We're wide awake anyway.</b>

<b>The sun hasn't even risen yet.</b>

<b>Why are you being a busybody when the sun isn't even out?</b>

<b>You're such a pain in the neck. You annoying punk.</b>

593

<b>How about instant noodles?</b>

594
00:41:34,610 --> 00:41:36,180
<b>Captain, how do instant noodles sound?</b>

595

<b>- Sounds good. - Okay.</b>

596
