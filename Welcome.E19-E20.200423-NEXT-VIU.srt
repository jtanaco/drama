<b>Hong Jo, come here.</b>

00:00:14,996 --> 00:00:17,166
<b>Where are you?</b>

00:00:18,567 --> 00:00:20,166

00:01:10,347 --> 00:01:11,947
<b>Gosh, this is killing me.</b>

10
00:01:19,356 --> 00:01:20,626
<b>You're just allergic.</b>

11
00:01:23,766 --> 00:01:25,166
<b>I should've left you behind.</b>

12
00:01:28,266 --> 00:01:29,867
<b>Leave the cat here...</b>

13
00:01:30,666 --> 00:01:32,766
<b>and focus on your webtoon.</b>

14
00:01:33,376 --> 00:01:36,537
<b>You never upload things on time.</b>

15
00:01:37,546 --> 00:01:39,876
<b>You need to be steady in order to gain lots of viewers.</b>

16
00:01:40,177 --> 00:01:42,876
<b>Then what about you? Did you write a lot of poems?</b>

17
00:01:44,147 --> 00:01:46,087
<b>You told me you were going to write poems again.</b>

18
00:01:46,087 --> 00:01:47,186
<b>Do you want to read them?</b>

19
00:01:47,386 --> 00:01:50,026
<b>No, it's okay. They're boring.</b>

20
00:01:55,026 --> 00:01:57,927
<b>I liked the drawing you drew a few days ago.</b>

21
00:01:58,626 --> 00:02:02,266
<b>I could tell that you've come to deeply care for the cat.</b>

22
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:04,337
<b>Do you think you'll be okay?</b>

23
00:02:05,737 --> 00:02:08,077
<b>Such a relationship isn't easy...</b>

24
00:02:08,607 --> 00:02:10,307
<b>for a person or a cat.</b>

25
00:02:14,276 --> 00:02:15,746
<b>You can sometimes visit to see the cat.</b>

26
00:02:18,387 --> 00:02:20,057
<b>Who says I'm going to leave him behind?</b>

27
00:02:20,186 --> 00:02:21,887
<b>I'll take care of him for you.</b>

28
00:02:21,887 --> 00:02:25,357
<b>Then you'll visit me every now and then to see the cat.</b>

29
00:02:25,987 --> 00:02:27,256
<b>But...</b>

30
00:02:28,457 --> 00:02:29,927
<b>why are you here?</b>

31
00:02:30,996 --> 00:02:32,297
<b>Because Sol Ah...</b>

32
00:02:33,066 --> 00:02:34,566
<b>needs some time.</b>

33
00:02:37,137 --> 00:02:38,436
<b>And I have nowhere else to go...</b>

34
00:02:40,006 --> 00:02:41,276
<b>other than here.</b>

35
00:02:46,876 --> 00:02:49,976
<b>I should've thrown your collar into the sea.</b>

36
00:02:50,846 --> 00:02:52,446
<b>Let me stay for the time being.</b>

37
00:02:53,387 --> 00:02:54,587
<b>Come down and eat.</b>

38
00:02:55,286 --> 00:02:56,286
<b>Again?</b>

39
00:02:56,286 --> 00:02:58,186
<b>It's the weekend, but I can't even go on a date...</b>

40
00:02:58,186 --> 00:02:59,587
<b>because I need to work part-time.</b>

41
00:03:00,196 --> 00:03:01,726
<b>So I was hoping you'd come down and eat with me.</b>

42
00:03:03,196 --> 00:03:05,767
<b>Come down, okay? See you.</b>

43
00:03:08,367 --> 00:03:09,767
<b>Welcome.</b>

44
00:03:12,637 --> 00:03:14,577
<b>Didn't you say the part-timer here is really handsome?</b>

45
00:03:15,006 --> 00:03:16,906
<b>Let's go somewhere else.</b>

46
00:03:17,077 --> 00:03:18,607
<b>- Come on. - You guys.</b>

47
00:03:19,006 --> 00:03:21,147
<b>I'm not a part-timer. I'm the owner's son.</b>

48
00:03:26,017 --> 00:03:29,686
<b>I kind of understand them.</b>

49
00:03:29,786 --> 00:03:33,226
<b>He should've just taken after me.</b>

50
00:03:48,707 --> 00:03:49,776
<b>Ji Eun.</b>

51
00:03:50,376 --> 00:03:52,376
<b>Hey, Sol Ah.</b>

52
00:03:52,376 --> 00:03:53,446
<b>What are you doing here?</b>

53
00:03:54,876 --> 00:03:55,876
<b>Well...</b>

54
00:03:55,876 --> 00:03:57,387
<b>You must be here to eat.</b>

55
00:03:57,887 --> 00:03:59,487
<b>- Well... - Let's go.</b>

56
00:04:00,756 --> 00:04:02,387
<b>Hello.</b>

57
00:04:02,387 --> 00:04:04,427
<b>There you are. You're here, too?</b>

58
00:04:04,587 --> 00:04:06,357
<b>- We have customers. - What?</b>

59
00:04:07,096 --> 00:04:08,526
<b>My goodness.</b>

60
00:04:08,526 --> 00:04:11,596
<b>Look who's here. Sol Ah, it's you.</b>

61
00:04:11,596 --> 00:04:13,737
<b>- You look beautiful. - Thank you.</b>

62
00:04:13,737 --> 00:04:15,967
<b>Honey! Sol Ah's here!</b>

63
00:04:15,967 --> 00:04:16,967
<b>Sol Ah?</b>

64
00:04:17,607 --> 00:04:21,607
<b>My goodness, you're right! Sol Ah, it's been so long!</b>

65
00:04:21,607 --> 00:04:23,607
<b>It's so nice to see you. Sit down.</b>

66
00:04:23,607 --> 00:04:25,076
<b>- Have you been well? - Yes.</b>

67
00:04:25,076 --> 00:04:26,706
<b>- Of course. - Ji Eun's here, too.</b>

68
00:04:26,706 --> 00:04:27,876
<b>Welcome.</b>

69
00:04:28,277 --> 00:04:30,787
<b>I always told you to drop by for a meal.</b>

70
00:04:30,787 --> 00:04:32,746
<b>Why didn't you come for so long? I missed you so much.</b>

71
00:04:32,746 --> 00:04:34,256
<b>I missed you, too.</b>

72
00:04:34,287 --> 00:04:37,826
<b>I heard your father went to the countryside. Is he well?</b>

73
00:04:37,826 --> 00:04:39,027
<b>Yes, he's doing well.</b>

74
00:04:39,027 --> 00:04:40,696
<b>I visited him for his birthday.</b>

75
00:04:40,696 --> 00:04:42,396
<b>And he asked me to give you this.</b>

76
00:04:42,396 --> 00:04:43,597
<b>- My goodness. - Gosh.</b>

77
00:04:43,597 --> 00:04:45,167
<b>- He didn't need to give us this. - You could've...</b>

78
00:04:45,167 --> 00:04:47,066
<b>- come empty-handed. - You didn't have to bring anything.</b>

79
00:04:47,066 --> 00:04:48,467
<b>- What's this? - What's this?</b>

80
00:04:48,467 --> 00:04:49,467
<b>This is...</b>

81
00:04:49,967 --> 00:04:51,266
<b>It's bracken!</b>

82
00:04:51,266 --> 00:04:53,336
<b>- Why did he send us so much? - My goodness.</b>

83
00:04:53,336 --> 00:04:54,636
<b>Did he start a bracken farm?</b>

84
00:04:54,636 --> 00:04:56,946
<b>- No. - Ji Eun's nickname is Bracken too.</b>

85
00:05:04,917 --> 00:05:06,646
<b>Really? Why?</b>

86
00:05:06,646 --> 00:05:11,186
<b>I don't know. That's what people say when someone has small hands.</b>

87
00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:14,326
<b>They're small, aren't they? It's cute. They look like bracken.</b>

88
00:05:15,797 --> 00:05:17,266
<b>Did you give her that nickname?</b>

89
00:05:17,266 --> 00:05:18,367
<b>No, my mom did.</b>

90
00:05:18,867 --> 00:05:20,266
<b>Right, Mom?</b>

91
00:05:23,436 --> 00:05:26,467
<b>My goodness, when did you hear that?</b>

92
00:05:27,376 --> 00:05:29,477
<b>You must be hungry.</b>

93
00:05:29,677 --> 00:05:32,777
<b>Honey, hurry up and grill some mackerel...</b>

94
00:05:32,777 --> 00:05:34,816
<b>- so the kids can eat. - Yes, of course.</b>

95
00:05:34,816 --> 00:05:36,376
<b>- I'll take this inside. - Just wait a little bit.</b>

96
00:05:36,376 --> 00:05:37,417
<b>Okay.</b>

97
00:05:39,446 --> 00:05:41,717
<b>How was the trip? What about Bang Guk Bong?</b>

98
00:05:41,756 --> 00:05:42,816
<b>What?</b>

99
00:05:43,287 --> 00:05:44,886
<b>Oh, well...</b>

100
00:05:46,386 --> 00:05:48,927
<b>By the way, is Ji Eun a regular here?</b>

101
00:05:49,396 --> 00:05:51,196
<b>You even got yourself a cute nickname.</b>

102
00:05:52,266 --> 00:05:53,367
<b>We're going out.</b>

103
00:05:53,367 --> 00:05:54,367
<b>What?</b>

104
00:05:58,407 --> 00:06:00,477
<b>Are... Are you serious?</b>

105
00:06:03,977 --> 00:06:07,146
<b>My gosh! Congratulations, you guys. You must be really happy.</b>

106
00:06:08,646 --> 00:06:09,717
<b>Thanks.</b>

107
00:06:26,066 --> 00:06:27,436
<b>Did something good happen?</b>

108
00:06:28,797 --> 00:06:29,836
<b>What?</b>

109
00:06:33,467 --> 00:06:34,907
<b>- I can't tell you. - What is it?</b>

110
00:06:40,177 --> 00:06:42,417
<b>Oh, well...</b>

111
00:06:45,117 --> 00:06:46,686
<b>It's about someone else.</b>

112
00:06:50,256 --> 00:06:52,057
<b>Okay, you should go home.</b>

113
00:06:53,157 --> 00:06:54,196
<b>Okay.</b>

114
00:07:23,516 --> 00:07:24,557
<b>Can I go inside?</b>

115
00:07:25,756 --> 00:07:26,756
<b>Well...</b>

116
00:07:27,727 --> 00:07:29,557
<b>I didn't get to clean the place.</b>

117
00:07:33,167 --> 00:07:34,367
<b>I came to give you this.</b>

118
00:07:34,867 --> 00:07:36,097
<b>It's stir-fried bracken.</b>

119
00:07:37,006 --> 00:07:38,807
<b>My mom made them just now.</b>

120
00:07:39,967 --> 00:07:41,477
<b>The smell of perilla oil is amazing, isn't it?</b>

121
00:07:42,136 --> 00:07:45,706
<b>I wanted to eat it with you and hold your cute, small hands.</b>

122
00:07:45,706 --> 00:07:47,746
<b>That's not what she meant when she called me that.</b>

123
00:07:47,746 --> 00:07:48,816
<b>What?</b>

124
00:07:51,016 --> 00:07:52,646
<b>She was talking about brackens...</b>

125
00:07:53,186 --> 00:07:54,956
<b>that turned too mushy because they were boiled too much.</b>

126
00:07:57,157 --> 00:07:58,787
<b>That's what she thinks of me.</b>

127
00:07:59,527 --> 00:08:02,326
<b>Gosh, that's nonsense. Do you want me to ask my mom?</b>

128
00:08:03,867 --> 00:08:05,896
<b>No, don't tell her anything.</b>

129
00:08:06,996 --> 00:08:08,297
<b>Don't say anything to her.</b>

130
00:08:13,237 --> 00:08:16,607
<b>If she finds out we're dating, she'll be disappointed.</b>

131
00:08:17,376 --> 00:08:18,977
<b>That's nonsense.</b>

132
00:08:19,177 --> 00:08:22,217
<b>You can come next time after I clean my house.</b>

133
00:08:24,246 --> 00:08:25,287
<b>But...</b>

134
00:08:26,347 --> 00:08:28,256
<b>- Ji Eun. - See you.</b>

135
00:08:28,557 --> 00:08:29,586
<b>Hey, wait.</b>

136
00:08:36,997 --> 00:08:39,167
<b>I owe you guys an apology.</b>

137
00:08:39,596 --> 00:08:42,366
<b>I think I expected too much from you guys...</b>

138
00:08:42,366 --> 00:08:44,507
<b>when you are young and inexperienced.</b>

139
00:08:44,966 --> 00:08:47,606
<b>Ji Eun, you wasted so much time.</b>

140
00:08:49,137 --> 00:08:51,976
<b>The same goes for Sol Ah and Doo Sik.</b>

141
00:08:55,017 --> 00:08:58,686
<b>This won't meet up to our company's reputation.</b>

142
00:08:58,787 --> 00:09:01,616
<b>The clients keep asking us for revisions.</b>

143
00:09:02,216 --> 00:09:04,387
<b>You guys are off the project. Hand over the materials to Mr. Cha.</b>

144
00:09:05,686 --> 00:09:06,726
<b>Do you understand?</b>

145
00:09:09,397 --> 00:09:10,427
<b>Okay.</b>

146
00:09:12,497 --> 00:09:15,167
<b>I'm sorry for the sudden notice, but do me a favor.</b>

147
00:09:15,167 --> 00:09:16,936
<b>Yes, of course.</b>

148
00:09:17,167 --> 00:09:19,366
<b>- That's all for today's meeting. - Wait. But...</b>

149
00:09:21,706 --> 00:09:22,777
<b>What just happened?</b>

150
00:09:23,507 --> 00:09:26,047
<b>- Did we just lose our project? - You didn't lose it.</b>

151
00:09:26,047 --> 00:09:28,677
<b>We're a family. We should fill up for each other when it's necessary.</b>

152
00:09:30,686 --> 00:09:31,716
<b>Let's go.</b>

153
00:09:39,956 --> 00:09:41,726
<b>That was a huge punch in the face.</b>

154
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:43,557
<b>Why didn't you say anything?</b>

155
00:09:43,596 --> 00:09:45,566
<b>You shouldn't have just said okay to that.</b>

156
00:09:46,726 --> 00:09:49,897
<b>It's true that the clients kept asking for revisions.</b>

157
00:09:50,566 --> 00:09:52,436
<b>You know what? Let me go talk to her.</b>

158
00:10:03,247 --> 00:10:04,287
<b>What do you need?</b>

159
00:10:09,316 --> 00:10:12,956
<b>I don't think it's fair to take our projects away from us like that.</b>

160
00:10:13,027 --> 00:10:14,057
<b>How so?</b>

161
00:10:14,057 --> 00:10:16,826
<b>The three of us did our best...</b>

162
00:10:16,826 --> 00:10:17,927
<b>You did your best?</b>

163
00:10:18,366 --> 00:10:20,566
<b>You were busy doing other stuff, and you call that your best?</b>

164
00:10:23,096 --> 00:10:25,037
<b>I draw webtoons after work.</b>

165
00:10:25,466 --> 00:10:27,907
<b>There aren't any rules saying I'm not allowed to have two jobs.</b>

<b>Sol Ah.</b>

<b>You think your job is boring, don't you?</b>

168
00:10:32,576 --> 00:10:34,377
<b>You think it's boring and meaningless.</b>

169
00:10:34,677 --> 00:10:35,677
<b>What?</b>

170
00:10:36,547 --> 00:10:38,047
<b>No, I don't...</b>

171
00:10:38,047 --> 00:10:40,986
<b>"It's boring because you always ask me to do boring stuff."</b>

172
00:10:41,316 --> 00:10:42,657
<b>Is that what you wanted to say?</b>

173
00:10:43,116 --> 00:10:45,826
<b>Why do you think I ask Ji Eun to work on the important stuff...</b>

174
00:10:46,186 --> 00:10:49,657
<b>and ask you to work on all the boring projects?</b>

175
00:10:50,127 --> 00:10:52,127
<b>Because she did me a personal favor?</b>

176
00:10:52,927 --> 00:10:53,936
<b>No.</b>

177
00:10:54,366 --> 00:10:56,966
<b>It's because she enjoys everything she does.</b>

178
00:10:57,507 --> 00:10:59,206
<b>Whether it's a project from a big corporation...</b>

179

<b>or simply designing a wedding invitation.</b>

180
00:11:02,177 --> 00:11:04,976
<b>You're not desperate enough, Sol Ah.</b>

181
00:11:10,816 --> 00:11:13,446
<b>What does it mean to be desperate?</b>

182
00:11:15,057 --> 00:11:17,257
<b>Do you expect me to endure everything you ask me to do...</b>

183
00:11:17,356 --> 00:11:19,627
<b>and stay quiet even though I lose my projects?</b>

184
00:11:20,387 --> 00:11:23,826
<b>Is giving up everything the only way to be desperate and sincere?</b>

185
00:11:24,627 --> 00:11:26,696
<b>I always worked with sincerity.</b>

186
00:11:27,966 --> 00:11:29,596
<b>I always tried to finish the work that was given to me...</b>

187
00:11:29,596 --> 00:11:31,267
<b>regardless of whether or not it was fun.</b>

188
00:11:31,267 --> 00:11:32,637
<b>And the same goes for this project...</b>

189
00:11:32,637 --> 00:11:35,206
<b>Do you think you're in charge of the project?</b>

190
00:11:35,907 --> 00:11:37,907
<b>You're not qualified to be in charge.</b>

191
00:11:38,247 --> 00:11:39,307
<b>Now, please leave.</b>

192
00:11:45,887 --> 00:11:47,257
<b>She won't even listen to me.</b>

193
00:11:47,657 --> 00:11:49,956
<b>I think you should try talking to her yourself.</b>

194
00:11:50,116 --> 00:11:51,127

<b>Why are you...</b>

198
00:12:02,297 --> 00:12:04,866
<b>I figured I should finish what I started.</b>

199
00:12:04,866 --> 00:12:07,066
<b>This is why she treats you like a pushover.</b>

200

<b>What's going on? Are you guys fighting?</b>

201

<b>No, it's just that she's working on the wedding...</b>

202

<b>I know we're just working on a small project.</b>

205

<b>But she's not doing anything even though she's our leader.</b>

206
00:12:29,627 --> 00:12:31,427
<b>Why would you assume that she's not doing anything?</b>

207
00:12:32,497 --> 00:12:35,537
<b>This might be her way of trying to solve the problem.</b>

210
00:12:41,907 --> 00:12:45,177

211

218
00:13:45,936 --> 00:13:46,966
<b>the cat is too old.</b>

219
00:13:48,877 --> 00:13:51,846
<b>I guess there's not much time left for this cat.</b>

220

<b>A lot less than what you think.</b>

00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:36,277
<b>I said I wanted to apologize.</b>

314
00:21:37,076 --> 00:21:38,707
<b>If Doo Sik were to see this,</b>

315
00:21:38,707 --> 00:21:40,707
<b>he'd make a fuss thinking I made you cry.</b>

316
00:21:42,717 --> 00:21:44,346
<b>You don't know why...</b>

317
00:21:45,316 --> 00:21:47,717
<b>I had Doo Sik's eraser, do you?</b>

318
00:21:55,096 --> 00:21:56,697
<b>Hey, lend me your eraser.</b>

319
00:21:57,297 --> 00:21:58,896
<b>Sure. Here.</b>

320
00:22:04,297 --> 00:22:05,606
<b>- Hey. - What?</b>

321
00:22:05,606 --> 00:22:06,807
<b>- Your eraser. - Goodness.</b>

322
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:14,747
<b>Here, keep it.</b>

323
00:22:18,487 --> 00:22:21,616
<b>Hey, could you at least try to be more imaginative?</b>

324
00:22:21,616 --> 00:22:23,517
<b>- What is that? - What's what?</b>

325
00:22:23,517 --> 00:22:25,457
<b>- I found... - You're too far off.</b>

326
00:22:26,027 --> 00:22:27,027
<b>Draw something.</b>

327
00:22:27,027 --> 00:22:28,457
<b>You dropped this.</b>

328
00:22:29,626 --> 00:22:31,057
<b>You call that a drawing? What's that?</b>

329
00:22:31,057 --> 00:22:33,967
<b>- An apple or a persimmon? - Don't you even have an eraser?</b>

330
00:22:35,297 --> 00:22:36,596
<b>You have one.</b>

331
00:22:37,636 --> 00:22:40,606
<b>Your eraser is mine also.</b>

332
00:22:40,606 --> 00:22:41,707
<b>Find it quick.</b>

333
00:22:44,207 --> 00:22:45,646
<b>Did anyone see my eraser?</b>

334
00:22:50,316 --> 00:22:51,846
<b>Have one of your own.</b>

335
00:22:54,856 --> 00:22:56,017
<b>Thanks.</b>

336
00:22:59,557 --> 00:23:02,656
<b>Do you know what's worst about keeping quiet?</b>

337
00:23:04,227 --> 00:23:06,666
<b>Things keep piling on you before you let it out.</b>

338
00:23:08,037 --> 00:23:09,136
<b>To be honest,</b>

339
00:23:11,136 --> 00:23:14,437
<b>I had a lot of things against Ms. Park.</b>

340
00:23:15,336 --> 00:23:17,237
<b>I just pretended to be nice,</b>

341
00:23:19,207 --> 00:23:20,376
<b>but on the inside,</b>

342
00:23:21,916 --> 00:23:24,116
<b>I was full of hatred and resentment.</b>

343
00:23:25,517 --> 00:23:27,217
<b>I did nothing about it,</b>

344
00:23:28,656 --> 00:23:30,787
<b>but I got jealous without anyone noticing.</b>

345
00:23:31,727 --> 00:23:33,057
<b>And I hated people.</b>

346
00:23:33,926 --> 00:23:35,057
<b>In the end,</b>

347
00:23:35,626 --> 00:23:38,126
<b>I hated myself the most.</b>

348
00:23:40,126 --> 00:23:41,636
<b>I hate myself so much.</b>

349
00:23:45,737 --> 00:23:46,906
<b>You won't know.</b>

350
00:23:48,106 --> 00:23:50,406
<b>Because you sparkle and shine.</b>

351
00:23:50,807 --> 00:23:52,676
<b>You don't know how I feel inside either.</b>

352
00:23:55,346 --> 00:23:58,316
<b>I pretend to be righteous and responsible on the outside.</b>

353
00:24:03,916 --> 00:24:06,527
<b>Do you know who this belongs to?</b>

354
00:24:09,297 --> 00:24:11,697
<b>It belongs to the person I cowardly pushed away.</b>

355
00:24:14,096 --> 00:24:15,096
<b>No.</b>

356
00:24:18,007 --> 00:24:19,267
<b>The cat.</b>

357
00:24:40,287 --> 00:24:43,396
<b>I guess he needs a while longer to get ready.</b>

358
00:24:43,596 --> 00:24:45,197
<b>Shall I bring you more tea?</b>

359
00:24:47,467 --> 00:24:49,566
<b>No. We'll just get going.</b>

360
00:24:54,606 --> 00:24:55,807
<b>Where are you going?</b>

361
00:24:55,906 --> 00:24:57,737
<b>We can't wait here forever.</b>

362
00:25:18,126 --> 00:25:19,426
<b>What happened?</b>

363
00:25:19,527 --> 00:25:21,066
<b>Did something happen?</b>

364
00:25:22,096 --> 00:25:23,937
<b>Nothing happened at all.</b>

365
00:25:23,937 --> 00:25:26,937
<b>I'm fine. I walk and run just fine.</b>

366
00:25:27,636 --> 00:25:30,836
<b>I sit in a wheelchair to give them one less thing to nag about.</b>

367
00:25:30,836 --> 00:25:31,906
<b>How come...</b>

368
00:25:33,547 --> 00:25:35,047
<b>Why didn't you tell me?</b>

369
00:25:37,346 --> 00:25:40,987
<b>Did you ever even call me?</b>

370
00:25:41,557 --> 00:25:44,787
<b>Oh. You did call to brag to me once...</b>

371
00:25:45,326 --> 00:25:47,126
<b>that you're opening a leather workshop.</b>

372
00:25:47,656 --> 00:25:48,727
<b>Was this why...</b>

373
00:25:49,856 --> 00:25:51,467
<b>you couldn't come that day?</b>

374
00:25:52,227 --> 00:25:54,896
<b>Were you upset with me until now because I didn't show up?</b>

375
00:25:54,937 --> 00:25:56,596
<b>When you never came by once?</b>

376
00:25:56,737 --> 00:25:58,037
<b>Because you threw me out.</b>

377
00:26:04,307 --> 00:26:05,646
<b>Why are you here?</b>

378
00:26:06,307 --> 00:26:08,247
<b>Do you want to read my will?</b>

379
00:26:08,616 --> 00:26:11,717
<b>Because you found out my condition?</b>

380
00:26:12,017 --> 00:26:13,586
<b>That's not why.</b>

381
00:26:18,727 --> 00:26:19,886
<b>Who's he?</b>

382
00:26:25,866 --> 00:26:28,896
<b>I came to ask you to take in a cat.</b>

383
00:26:29,237 --> 00:26:30,467
<b>A cat?</b>

384
00:26:36,207 --> 00:26:37,876
<b>It was abandoned.</b>

385
00:26:44,217 --> 00:26:46,316
<b>It's old, like me.</b>

386
00:26:51,287 --> 00:26:55,156
<b>You suddenly show up after years away to say...</b>

387
00:26:56,197 --> 00:26:57,896
<b>you want me to adopt a cat?</b>

388
00:26:58,666 --> 00:27:00,967
<b>One that's already old...</b>

389
00:27:01,467 --> 00:27:04,136
<b>and doesn't have much time left?</b>

390
00:27:04,737 --> 00:27:08,106
<b>You came to ask me such a difficult favor?</b>

391
00:27:08,836 --> 00:27:09,906
<b>You?</b>

392
00:27:13,507 --> 00:27:15,176
<b>It was wrong for me to come here.</b>

393
00:27:17,916 --> 00:27:19,487
<b>I just thought...</b>

394
00:27:25,287 --> 00:27:26,326
<b>Jae Seon.</b>

395
00:27:31,227 --> 00:27:32,326
<b>Thank you.</b>

396
00:27:33,727 --> 00:27:35,336
<b>It's the first time...</b>

397
00:27:36,437 --> 00:27:38,636
<b>you asked me to do you a favor.</b>

398
00:27:40,237 --> 00:27:41,977
<b>You thought you were so great,</b>

399
00:27:42,707 --> 00:27:43,906
<b>you never...</b>

400
00:27:45,447 --> 00:27:47,676
<b>asked for anything, which was so upsetting.</b>

401
00:27:49,116 --> 00:27:50,876
<b>But thank you for coming to me.</b>

402
00:27:52,616 --> 00:27:54,487
<b>Thank you for asking me for something.</b>

403
00:27:56,386 --> 00:27:57,557
<b>Thank you.</b>

404
00:28:07,126 --> 00:28:08,166
<b>Father.</b>

405
00:28:15,606 --> 00:28:18,807
<b>Yes. I waited for this.</b>

406
00:28:32,386 --> 00:28:34,687
<b>I'm sorry. I...</b>

407
00:28:37,527 --> 00:28:39,066
<b>I thought...</b>

408
00:28:51,406 --> 00:28:52,477
<b>It's okay.</b>

409
00:29:06,557 --> 00:29:08,727
<b>(Episode 20 will air shortly.)</b>

410
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:10,709
<b>You said...</b>

411
00:29:12,109 --> 00:29:14,580
<b>he sat here and cried.</b>

412
00:29:15,849 --> 00:29:16,990
<b>Yes.</b>

413
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:18,750
<b>I think I know...</b>

414
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,719
<b>why he was crying.</b>

415
00:29:32,469 --> 00:29:33,500
<b>I'm not...</b>

416
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:37,710
<b>Bang Guk Bong.</b>

417
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:45,179
<b>He was pretending to be someone else.</b>

418
00:29:46,179 --> 00:29:47,320
<b>What do you mean?</b>

419
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:49,719
<b>Did he lie to you?</b>

420
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:52,219
<b>I was mistaken.</b>

421
00:29:53,289 --> 00:29:54,820
<b>I just saw what I wanted to.</b>

422
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:58,090
<b>Now that I think about it,</b>

423
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:01,229
<b>when we first met at home,</b>

424
00:30:01,259 --> 00:30:03,869
<b>he told me he wasn't Bang Guk Bong.</b>

425
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:05,799
<b>Then who was he?</b>

426
00:30:05,969 --> 00:30:07,170
<b>Hong Jo.</b>

427
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,239
<b>Hong Jo?</b>

428
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:10,510
<b>Your cat?</b>

429
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:11,670
<b>Hong Jo...</b>

430
00:30:13,709 --> 00:30:15,109
<b>was a person.</b>

431
00:30:15,439 --> 00:30:16,780
<b>That can't be.</b>

432
00:30:18,079 --> 00:30:21,750
<b>You lived in the same house until now?</b>

433
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:23,689
<b>Not now.</b>

434
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:27,659
<b>I kicked him out.</b>

435
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:32,689
<b>Who are you talking about?</b>

436
00:30:33,659 --> 00:30:35,859
<b>The cat? Or...</b>

437
00:30:35,859 --> 00:30:36,859
<b>Both.</b>

438
00:30:42,069 --> 00:30:43,569
<b>What should I do?</b>

439
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:50,079
<b>Could I really...</b>

440
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:53,150
<b>love a cat?</b>

441
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:00,120
<b>Can I love a cat?</b>

442
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:00,780
<b>Welcome back.</b>

443
00:32:10,759 --> 00:32:12,189
<b>Hey.</b>

444
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:15,000
<b>The cafe was closed early.</b>

445
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,229
<b>Jae Seon's at his parents' house.</b>

446
00:32:19,129 --> 00:32:21,770
<b>His home? How come?</b>

447
00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:23,569
<b>To give an abandoned cat a home.</b>

448
00:32:23,669 --> 00:32:25,340
<b>They both found one.</b>

449
00:32:25,509 --> 00:32:26,669
<b>The cat...</b>

450
00:32:27,379 --> 00:32:28,439
<b>and Jae Seon.</b>

451
00:32:29,409 --> 00:32:30,580
<b>Did you...</b>

452
00:32:31,509 --> 00:32:33,750
<b>take Jae Seon home?</b>

453
00:32:36,419 --> 00:32:39,750
<b>How did you do that? Even I couldn't manage.</b>

454
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:46,129
<b>Thanks.</b>

455
00:32:53,770 --> 00:32:55,900
<b>Do you not eat well?</b>

456
00:32:56,139 --> 00:32:57,469
<b>You don't look too good.</b>

457
00:32:57,969 --> 00:33:00,710
<b>Did something happen at work?</b>

458
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:07,650
<b>Are you sick?</b>

459
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:17,930
<b>I'm... I'm just a bit tired.</b>

460
00:34:34,069 --> 00:34:35,839
<b>What are you taking photos of?</b>

461
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:42,279
<b>Why did you photograph that?</b>

462
00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:44,050
<b>We sat here before.</b>

463
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:48,449
<b>I first saw you somewhere around here.</b>

464
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:57,189
<b>It was Hong Jo.</b>

465
00:34:59,329 --> 00:35:00,430
<b>He was...</b>

466
00:35:02,029 --> 00:35:04,029
<b>next to me that night.</b>

467
00:35:07,339 --> 00:35:08,370
<b>Even when...</b>

468
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,339
<b>(Jae Seon)</b>

469
00:35:10,339 --> 00:35:11,810
<b>I didn't know.</b>

470
00:35:32,459 --> 00:35:34,560
<b>He was always next to me.</b>

471
00:36:07,899 --> 00:36:09,860
<b>She doesn't have a fever.</b>

472
00:36:20,439 --> 00:36:21,610
<b>It's cold.</b>

473
00:37:42,490 --> 00:37:44,330
<b>It's still cold.</b>

474
00:37:45,529 --> 00:37:47,360
<b>Her hands were so hot all night last time.</b>

475
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:13,120
<b>The day it rained?</b>

476
00:38:17,629 --> 00:38:18,659
<b>Did you...</b>

477
00:38:23,059 --> 00:38:24,500
<b>secretly change into a human back then too?</b>

478
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:38,710
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

479
00:38:45,049 --> 00:38:47,389
<b>How long were you secretly a human?</b>

480
00:38:51,429 --> 00:38:53,429
<b>You spied on me these last few days, right?</b>

481
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:57,200
<b>My room, my bed...</b>

482
00:38:58,570 --> 00:39:00,200
<b>For how long, and how much...</b>

483
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,799
<b>have you've been spying on me?</b>

484
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:07,169
<b>Tell me.</b>

485
00:39:19,649 --> 00:39:21,289
<b>For as long as you were alone.</b>

486
00:40:00,529 --> 00:40:02,159
<b>You always took care of others on your own...</b>

487
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,730
<b>and forgot your own stuff.</b>

488
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:09,370
<b>Don't drink too much.</b>

489
00:40:09,669 --> 00:40:11,870
<b>I might be working late, so don't make a mess.</b>

490
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:21,750
<b>You were sick too,</b>

491
00:40:23,279 --> 00:40:24,750
<b>but didn't even say anything.</b>

492
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:30,289
<b>My cat. He keeps shivering.</b>

493
00:40:30,519 --> 00:40:33,090
<b>Don't get sick. Please.</b>

494
00:40:38,029 --> 00:40:39,129
<b>I wanted...</b>

495
00:40:44,070 --> 00:40:45,669
<b>to be next to you at least.</b>

496
00:40:54,549 --> 00:40:55,620
<b>Are you...</b>

497
00:40:58,519 --> 00:41:00,019
<b>really human only when you're next to me?</b>

498
00:41:09,259 --> 00:41:10,299
<b>Why?</b>

499
00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:14,269
<b>Why is it only when you're with me?</b>

500
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:17,169
<b>I don't know either.</b>

501
00:41:19,509 --> 00:41:20,870
<b>Maybe it's because...</b>

502
00:41:24,309 --> 00:41:25,950
<b>a cat cannot hug you.</b>

503
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:30,879
<b>I have to be human...</b>

504
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:34,320
<b>to hug you.</b>

505
00:41:44,669 --> 00:41:46,370
<b>What are you doing then?</b>

506
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:48,970
<b>You're human now.</b>

507
00:41:50,370 --> 00:41:51,809
<b>You have arms...</b>

508
00:41:55,639 --> 00:41:56,779
<b>and hands.</b>

509
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:34,980
<b>By the way,</b>

510
00:42:36,250 --> 00:42:38,419
<b>there was a drink inside this bottle.</b>

511
00:42:41,889 --> 00:42:42,919
<b>Did you throw it away?</b>

512
00:42:51,330 --> 00:42:52,330
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

513
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:58,440
<b>I had a hot massage pack in the drawer.</b>

514
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:01,309
<b>I guess you didn't see that when you spied on me.</b>

515
00:43:12,889 --> 00:43:14,049
<b>You must've been cleaning.</b>

516
00:43:14,389 --> 00:43:15,559
<b>Do you want me to come in?</b>

517
00:43:16,389 --> 00:43:17,460
<b>Wait...</b>

518
00:43:25,399 --> 00:43:26,629
<b>So this is what your place looks like.</b>

519
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:35,240
<b>(Doo Sik and Ji Eun)</b>

520
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:37,480
<b>Sticky notes.</b>

521
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:47,960
<b>You already finished it.</b>

522
00:43:48,389 --> 00:43:50,120
<b>You talked so sadly about bracken.</b>

523
00:43:51,990 --> 00:43:53,059
<b>It tasted good.</b>

524
00:43:53,559 --> 00:43:55,360
<b>What else do you want? Just say it.</b>

525
00:43:55,429 --> 00:43:58,769
<b>It's okay. I shouldn't just return an empty container.</b>

526
00:43:58,899 --> 00:43:59,970
<b>Give it to me.</b>

527
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:01,840
<b>No need to be so polite. You're like family.</b>

528
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:02,840
<b>Just give me it.</b>

529
00:44:04,610 --> 00:44:05,639
<b>You can...</b>

530
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:08,409
<b>have this.</b>

531
00:44:11,850 --> 00:44:14,080
<b>Everything that belongs to me is yours now.</b>

532
00:44:15,850 --> 00:44:16,950
<b>My eraser...</b>

533
00:44:18,950 --> 00:44:20,019
<b>and my heart.</b>

534
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:23,620
<b>This is as far as I'll go tonight.</b>

535
00:44:24,059 --> 00:44:25,690
<b>This is probably your first time doing stuff like this...</b>

536
00:44:27,190 --> 00:44:29,000
<b>so I'll take it slow for you.</b>

537
00:44:29,830 --> 00:44:31,169
<b>It's not my first time.</b>

538
00:44:38,669 --> 00:44:39,809
<b>You've done this?</b>

539
00:44:40,309 --> 00:44:45,179
<b>Well, if "stuff like this" means dating.</b>

540
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:48,549
<b>But...</b>

541
00:44:49,779 --> 00:44:50,779
<b>you said...</b>

542
00:44:52,250 --> 00:44:54,690
<b>you had my eraser for 10 years.</b>

543
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:58,330
<b>I had the eraser, but dating is a different story.</b>

544
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:03,029
<b>Oh, right.</b>

545
00:45:03,529 --> 00:45:05,600
<b>Of course, we're all grown-ups.</b>

546
00:45:13,570 --> 00:45:15,440
<b>- How many times? - Aren't you going?</b>

547
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:17,440
<b>I'll go. I'm going.</b>

548
00:45:21,450 --> 00:45:22,480
<b>For how long?</b>

549
00:45:24,649 --> 00:45:26,049
<b>What's the longest time you've dated a guy?</b>

550
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:28,190
<b>Good night.</b>

551
00:45:28,889 --> 00:45:30,759
<b>- Go. Come on. - But...</b>

552
00:45:32,059 --> 00:45:34,529
<b>- You should go. - Well, okay.</b>

553
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:38,769
<b>Good... Good night.</b>

554
00:45:40,299 --> 00:45:41,470
<b>Bye.</b>

555
00:45:52,909 --> 00:45:54,080
<b>You're drinking coffee again?</b>

556
00:45:58,049 --> 00:46:00,419
<b>Since you'll turn into a cat if you fall asleep?</b>

557
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:06,360
<b>Oh.</b>

558
00:46:08,630 --> 00:46:09,759
<b>I learned this.</b>

559
00:46:11,029 --> 00:46:12,099
<b>Watch carefully.</b>

560
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:16,440
<b>Guess what this is.</b>

561
00:46:17,299 --> 00:46:20,109
<b>- A spoon? - No, watch carefully.</b>

562
00:46:21,779 --> 00:46:22,809
<b>See?</b>

563
00:46:24,539 --> 00:46:26,349
<b>- I got it. - You do?</b>

564
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:27,779
<b>A mushroom.</b>

565
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:30,480
<b>It's a cat.</b>

566
00:46:40,859 --> 00:46:41,859
<b>Thank you.</b>

567
00:46:46,130 --> 00:46:48,240
<b>Then did you...</b>

568
00:46:48,670 --> 00:46:52,339
<b>see me picking my nose and stuff?</b>

569
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:56,980
<b>Sometimes when I eat,</b>

570
00:46:58,609 --> 00:47:01,109
<b>I even unbuckle my belt. Did you see that too?</b>

571
00:47:04,690 --> 00:47:07,990
<b>I even danced at night when I was feeling full.</b>

572
00:47:07,990 --> 00:47:09,190
<b>You saw that too?</b>

573
00:47:09,490 --> 00:47:10,890
<b>- You call that dancing? - Hey!</b>

574
00:47:12,890 --> 00:47:16,200
<b>Gosh, I can't believe it. You know everything about me.</b>

575
00:47:22,299 --> 00:47:24,910
<b>Is there anything else? Something I don't know?</b>

576
00:47:39,549 --> 00:47:42,619
<b>There's one more thing you don't know yet.</b>

577
00:47:43,390 --> 00:47:45,990
<b>There's nothing to fear anymore. What is it?</b>

578
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:52,900
<b>I'm a cat.</b>

579
00:47:53,230 --> 00:47:54,299
<b>I know that.</b>

580
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:56,569
<b>So...</b>

581
00:47:58,740 --> 00:48:00,440
<b>I will die before you do.</b>

582
00:48:04,279 --> 00:48:08,380
<b>A cat's time goes faster than a human's.</b>

583
00:48:12,319 --> 00:48:14,289
<b>Are you saying you only live...</b>

584
00:48:17,259 --> 00:48:19,430
<b>for the lifespan of a cat?</b>

585
00:48:25,369 --> 00:48:26,930
<b>Even so,</b>

586
00:48:27,529 --> 00:48:29,200
<b>you turn human, so...</b>

587
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:31,099
<b>You remember me from last winter.</b>

588
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:34,369
<b>I grew this much in a year.</b>

589
00:48:35,109 --> 00:48:37,279
<b>How do you think I'll look in a few years?</b>

590
00:48:39,710 --> 00:48:40,849
<b>Then...</b>

591
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:43,119
<b>One day,</b>

592
00:48:44,990 --> 00:48:46,619
<b>I'll disappear first.</b>

593
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:17,180
<b>No.</b>

594
00:49:17,849 --> 00:49:19,289
<b>Even if that's so,</b>

595
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:22,720
<b>that's in the far future. Why talk about parting already?</b>

596
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:26,089
<b>I'll stay by your side.</b>

597
00:49:26,990 --> 00:49:29,859
<b>Even if the end is decided, I'm going to go down this road.</b>

598
00:49:30,630 --> 00:49:32,599
<b>Because nothing is sure about how this road is going to turn out.</b>

599
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:36,470
<b>If there's anything I can do for you,</b>

600
00:49:37,170 --> 00:49:38,940
<b>I'll do it until the end.</b>

601
00:49:39,809 --> 00:49:40,940
<b>That's my choice.</b>

602
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:45,849
<b>Your choice...</b>

603
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:47,980
<b>is up to you.</b>

604
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:54,859
<b>You're saying to me...</b>

605
00:49:57,490 --> 00:49:59,130
<b>what I said to you.</b>

606
00:50:35,059 --> 00:50:36,059
<b>Hey, hey.</b>

607
00:50:38,099 --> 00:50:39,299
<b>Did you scald your hand?</b>

608
00:50:41,869 --> 00:50:43,000
<b>I'm fine.</b>

609
00:50:43,799 --> 00:50:46,609
<b>What did you do all night to be so out of it?</b>

610
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:54,549
<b>I told Sol Ah that...</b>

611
00:50:55,450 --> 00:50:57,049
<b>I'll disappear first.</b>

612
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:00,950
<b>I think...</b>

613
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:04,059
<b>I'll need to stay with you again.</b>

614
00:51:06,890 --> 00:51:08,829
<b>I'm out of antihistamines.</b>

615
00:51:16,099 --> 00:51:18,069
<b>Don't drink so much coffee.</b>

616
00:51:18,910 --> 00:51:20,039
<b>And get some sleep.</b>

617
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:23,480
<b>I'm fine.</b>

618
00:51:29,519 --> 00:51:30,980
<b>Good morning.</b>

619
00:51:31,180 --> 00:51:32,319
<b>Sol Ah.</b>

620
00:51:32,519 --> 00:51:34,150
<b>We got the pet food project back.</b>

621
00:51:34,150 --> 00:51:35,460
<b>What? How?</b>

622
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:37,960
<b>The client wanted you back on board.</b>

623
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:39,630
<b>Oh, really?</b>

624
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,059
<b>Isn't it great?</b>

625
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:46,000
<b>Who can complain if the client wants us?</b>

626
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,329
<b>Don't overreact.</b>

627
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:53,470
<b>It's all for the better.</b>

628
00:51:53,470 --> 00:51:57,480
<b>I only took it on because Ms. Park told me to.</b>

629
00:51:58,779 --> 00:52:00,609
<b>You three. Come see me.</b>

630
00:52:04,250 --> 00:52:06,089
<b>Do you think you won?</b>

631
00:52:07,990 --> 00:52:09,059
<b>No.</b>

632
00:52:09,059 --> 00:52:10,690
<b>That's right. You didn't.</b>

633
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:12,890
<b>It wasn't because you're good.</b>

634
00:52:12,890 --> 00:52:16,900
<b>It's because the client thought you were easier to push around.</b>

635
00:52:17,099 --> 00:52:20,069
<b>They were used to you. That's it.</b>

636
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:23,740
<b>But...</b>

637
00:52:24,470 --> 00:52:26,240
<b>that isn't how I felt.</b>

638
00:52:27,369 --> 00:52:30,039
<b>I'll say this just in case you misunderstood.</b>

639
00:52:30,410 --> 00:52:33,079
<b>I really did like you, Ji Eun.</b>

640
00:52:33,950 --> 00:52:37,420
<b>I also felt sorry for how she seemed so alone, like a lone island.</b>

641
00:52:41,250 --> 00:52:44,920
<b>Favors have a way of bringing people closer.</b>

642
00:52:45,289 --> 00:52:48,630
<b>Personal favors make a relationship personal.</b>

643
00:52:49,099 --> 00:52:51,869
<b>We sometimes ate and had tea together.</b>

644
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:54,000
<b>I thought we were friends.</b>

645
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:55,900
<b>I guess it was one-sided on my part.</b>

646
00:52:56,700 --> 00:52:57,839
<b>How sad.</b>

647
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:00,269
<b>Wait.</b>

648
00:53:03,109 --> 00:53:04,140
<b>Here you go.</b>

649
00:53:05,150 --> 00:53:06,180
<b>What is it?</b>

650
00:53:06,349 --> 00:53:08,849
<b>I wanted to finish it for you.</b>

651
00:53:21,630 --> 00:53:22,960
<b>My goodness.</b>

652
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:26,799
<b>I'm a great judge of character.</b>

653
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:29,599
<b>Do you want something sweet to drink?</b>

654
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:31,240
<b>No.</b>

655
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:32,609
<b>Shall I order some cake?</b>

656
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:33,869
<b>No.</b>

657
00:53:34,509 --> 00:53:35,910
<b>Not that.</b>

658
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:37,809
<b>Shall we go out and eat?</b>

659
00:53:40,779 --> 00:53:42,049
<b>Pay me.</b>

660
00:53:46,390 --> 00:53:48,819
<b>Not tea and not food.</b>

661
00:53:49,519 --> 00:53:50,690
<b>I want you...</b>

662
00:53:52,059 --> 00:53:53,730
<b>to pay me for my work.</b>

663
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:54,730
<b>What?</b>

664
00:53:56,059 --> 00:53:57,599
<b>I thought...</b>

665
00:53:58,099 --> 00:54:01,769
<b>we were close enough to say this.</b>

666
00:54:12,509 --> 00:54:13,710
<b>See?</b>

667
00:54:13,980 --> 00:54:15,950
<b>I got you right.</b>

668
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:19,019
<b>It's no fun if you're just obedient.</b>

669
00:54:19,420 --> 00:54:21,690
<b>Okay. Business is business.</b>

670
00:54:21,890 --> 00:54:23,490
<b>How much do you want?</b>

671
00:54:28,460 --> 00:54:29,599
<b>Will this do?</b>

672
00:54:33,369 --> 00:54:35,640
<b>I checked the going rate.</b>

673
00:54:40,109 --> 00:54:42,940
<b>Hey, give me a discount. We're close.</b>

674
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,069
<b>Who is it for?</b>

675
00:55:50,339 --> 00:55:51,410
<b>Your father?</b>

676
00:55:51,579 --> 00:55:52,609
<b>Yes.</b>

677
00:55:53,309 --> 00:55:54,609
<b>I'm visiting him.</b>

678
00:55:55,250 --> 00:55:57,049
<b>Watch the cafe for me.</b>

679
00:56:06,690 --> 00:56:07,859
<b>You have a visitor.</b>

680
00:56:08,599 --> 00:56:10,529
<b>You can take coffee orders.</b>

681
00:56:11,059 --> 00:56:12,500
<b>This one's here for you.</b>

682
00:56:30,450 --> 00:56:31,619
<b>Where's Sergei?</b>

683
00:56:36,589 --> 00:56:38,490
<b>- Why? - I want him back.</b>

684
00:56:45,299 --> 00:56:46,470
<b>Why now?</b>

685
00:56:47,230 --> 00:56:48,599
<b>Your in-laws don't want him.</b>

686
00:56:48,599 --> 00:56:50,700
<b>My friend runs a cat cafe.</b>

687
00:56:51,099 --> 00:56:52,410
<b>He's my gift.</b>

688
00:56:52,410 --> 00:56:53,509
<b>I can't go.</b>

689
00:56:54,339 --> 00:56:55,380
<b>What?</b>

690
00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:01,549
<b>He belongs to someone else now.</b>

691
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:05,019
<b>He was mine.</b>

692
00:57:05,589 --> 00:57:06,650
<b>Give him back.</b>

693
00:57:09,319 --> 00:57:11,789
<b>Where is he now? Where is he?</b>

694
00:57:14,289 --> 00:57:15,960
<b>Who has him?</b>

695
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:20,829
<b>Where is Sergei?</b>

696
00:57:21,369 --> 00:57:22,599
<b>Sergei?</b>

697
00:57:25,309 --> 00:57:26,470
<b>Sergei.</b>

698
00:57:26,710 --> 00:57:28,069
<b>Sergei, it's me.</b>

699
00:57:28,470 --> 00:57:30,279
<b>Where are you hiding?</b>

700
00:57:30,579 --> 00:57:33,009
<b>Sergei? Sergei.</b>

701
00:57:33,710 --> 00:57:36,319
<b>What? He was here all along.</b>

702
00:57:36,519 --> 00:57:38,619
<b>He's only here for a while for a few reasons.</b>

703
00:57:39,789 --> 00:57:41,150
<b>Did the person give him up?</b>

704
00:57:45,589 --> 00:57:46,930
<b>Sergei.</b>

705
00:57:47,460 --> 00:57:50,500
<b>Come here. It's me. Come here.</b>

706
00:57:53,299 --> 00:57:54,900
<b>You're old already?</b>

707
00:57:56,539 --> 00:57:59,039
<b>You were small and cute as a kitten.</b>

708
00:58:00,210 --> 00:58:03,109
<b>I feel bad for giving him away.</b>

709
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:05,609
<b>- Who would want him? - Me.</b>

710
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:13,720
<b>It's my cat.</b>

711
00:58:14,990 --> 00:58:16,490
<b>And it's Hong Jo, not Sergei.</b>

712
00:58:21,230 --> 00:58:22,400
<b>What a weird name.</b>

713
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,730
<b>Thank you for abandoning Hong Jo.</b>

714
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:32,109
<b>He might have been smaller and cuter then,</b>

715
00:58:32,769 --> 00:58:34,940
<b>but other than that short period that was less than a year,</b>

716
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:38,109
<b>thanks for letting him spend the rest of his time with me.</b>

717
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:40,880
<b>That time is so precious that...</b>

718
00:58:41,609 --> 00:58:43,150
<b>I'll cherish every second of it.</b>

719
00:58:44,549 --> 00:58:47,920
<b>I'll stay with Hong Jo and he will stay with me.</b>

720
00:58:49,190 --> 00:58:50,720
<b>That's what we chose to do.</b>

721
00:58:52,930 --> 00:58:54,289
<b>So don't feel bad.</b>

722
00:59:23,819 --> 00:59:25,759
<b>Did what she say make you that sad?</b>

723
00:59:26,660 --> 00:59:30,259
<b>Should I get jealous about a previous owner, not a girlfriend?</b>

724
00:59:36,170 --> 00:59:37,299
<b>How funny.</b>

725
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:40,670
<b>She has Sergei?</b>

726
00:59:41,470 --> 00:59:43,339
<b>Isn't that her excuse to check on you?</b>

727
00:59:43,740 --> 00:59:45,079
<b>I'm checking on her.</b>

728
00:59:46,210 --> 00:59:48,480
<b>You are? Why?</b>

729
00:59:49,250 --> 00:59:50,619
<b>Because she'll need me.</b>

730
00:59:53,819 --> 00:59:54,950
<b>Even more so now.</b>

731
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:58,089
<b>You said you became human to hug me.</b>

732
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:03,000
<b>I think this is the perfect time for that.</b>

733
01:00:07,670 --> 01:00:09,700
<b>Are you embarrassed that I'm looking?</b>

734
01:00:10,140 --> 01:00:11,269
<b>Shall I not look?</b>

735
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:21,450
<b>Hong Jo.</b>

736
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:24,920
<b>Why won't you change?</b>

737
01:00:29,190 --> 01:00:30,390
<b>Is it because...</b>

738
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:34,430
<b>you can't change?</b>

739
01:01:04,420 --> 01:01:07,329
<b>(Meow, the Secret Boy)</b>

740
01:01:07,329 --> 01:01:09,059
<b>I think I borrowed too much time.</b>

741
01:01:09,059 --> 01:01:11,930
<b>It's not easy, staying with her like a human being.</b>

742
01:01:11,930 --> 01:01:14,029
<b>I have you. That's enough.</b>

743
01:01:14,029 --> 01:01:16,269
<b>I keep wanting more. To be with her more.</b>

744
01:01:16,369 --> 01:01:18,200
<b>They saw my webtoon.</b>

745
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:20,009
<b>A human has human affairs.</b>

746
01:01:20,009 --> 01:01:22,710
<b>It's sad how I can't be part of that happiness.</b>

747
01:01:22,710 --> 01:01:24,210
<b>Why are you out here?</b>

748
01:01:24,210 --> 01:01:25,880
<b>I told you to wait at home.</b>

749
01:01:26,150 --> 01:01:27,210
<b>Why are you like this?</b>

750
01:01:27,849 --> 01:01:30,579
<b>Can't you look at me, even for just a while?</b>
