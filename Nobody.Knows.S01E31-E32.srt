<b>- Do you remember Kero?
- What?</b>

44
00:04:16,314 --> 00:04:18,949
<b>The black dog that the manager

45
00:04:19,349 --> 00:04:21,762
<b>He used to always bite people
when his leash was loose.</b>

46
00:04:21,786 --> 00:04:23,086
<b>But the kids...</b>

47
00:04:23,584 --> 00:04:26,256
<b>locked me up in a warehouse

48
00:04:27,586 --> 00:04:30,160
<b>My body and mind both froze in fear.</b>

49
00:04:30,227 --> 00:04:33,630
<b>When Kero was about to bite my neck,
you came in...</b>

50
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:36,805
<b>and reached your arm to his mouth.</b>

51
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,300
<b>I don't think that's an answer
to my question.</b>

52

<b>My mind that froze that day

<b>I can't...</b>

55
00:04:48,445 --> 00:04:51,515
<b>do anything

56
00:04:59,923 --> 00:05:01,057
<b>Wait here.</b>

57
00:05:10,651 --> 00:05:13,470
<b>It's okay. It's not too late yet.</b>

58
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:20,770
<b>- You came.
- Did you stir Doo Seok's mind?</b>

59
00:05:22,345 --> 00:05:25,092
<b>I saw that his mind was swaying,
so I incited him.</b>

60
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:26,616
<b>I wanted to see which way he leans.</b>

61
00:05:26,937 --> 00:05:29,019
<b>Do you think I can't see
what your mind is doing?</b>

62
00:05:30,593 --> 00:05:31,775
<b>I'm curious.</b>

63
00:05:33,256 --> 00:05:35,859
<b>What does my mind look like
to your eyes?</b>

64
00:05:40,945 --> 00:05:42,933
<b>I know you're worried
about what I might do...</b>

65
00:05:43,157 --> 00:05:44,534
<b>when I'm not around.</b>

66
00:05:49,181 --> 00:05:51,541
<b>What you said to me
when you saved my life.</b>

67
00:05:52,398 --> 00:05:55,645
<b>I've never heard better words
than those until now.</b>

68
00:05:56,113 --> 00:05:57,433
<b>Do you want me to tell you again?</b>

69
00:06:23,164 --> 00:06:25,642
<b>Lim Hee Jung's case doesn't have
any statute of limitations.</b>

70
00:06:27,727 --> 00:06:30,747
<b>I don't think
Sang Won killed Hee Jung.</b>

71
00:06:57,796 --> 00:06:59,676
<b>Let her speak.</b>

72
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:07,884
<b>Sang Won, help me.</b>

73
00:07:08,859 --> 00:07:11,388
<b>Sang Won!</b>

74

<b>If you save my life,</b>

75

<b>you and Sang Ho will...</b>

76
00:07:17,641 --> 00:07:18,662
<b>Stop.</b>

77
00:07:18,954 --> 00:07:20,539
<b>You are still...</b>

78
00:07:20,564 --> 00:07:23,447
<b>- giving me orders.
- No.</b>

79
00:07:24,312 --> 00:07:27,203
<b>If you help me,</b>

80
00:07:27,667 --> 00:07:29,639
<b>I'll do anything...</b>

81
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:32,049
<b>you tell me...</b>

82
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:53,096
<b>When greed conceives,
it gives birth to sin.</b>

83

<b>When the sin comes of age,</b>

84
00:07:55,899 --> 00:07:57,899
<b>it gives birth to death.</b>

85
00:08:02,322 --> 00:08:03,573
<b>Ki Ho,</b>

86
00:08:03,807 --> 00:08:06,509
<b>you still have no idea.</b>

87
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:09,179
<b>That boy has to be safe
from you forever.</b>

88
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:11,748
<b>- What?
- If then,</b>

89
00:08:12,406 --> 00:08:14,406
<b>you'll also be safe forever.</b>

90
00:08:16,328 --> 00:08:19,089
<b>The choice has become too easy

91
00:08:41,611 --> 00:08:43,913
<b>- Were you doing something?
- No.</b>

92
00:08:45,102 --> 00:08:46,321
<b>Oh, boy.</b>

93
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:50,020
<b>- Why are you staring at me?
- Because I like it.</b>

94
00:08:51,593 --> 00:08:53,833
<b>I like that you're
one of my students.</b>

95
00:08:53,857 --> 00:08:57,060
<b>And I like
that you're Ji Won's older brother.</b>

96
00:08:58,508 --> 00:08:59,508
<b>Hey, Eun Ho.</b>

97
00:08:59,763 --> 00:09:01,865
<b>I don't know about you,</b>

98
00:09:02,232 --> 00:09:03,233
<b>but I just like...</b>

99
00:09:03,733 --> 00:09:05,869
<b>being involved with you...</b>

100
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:09,906
<b>whether it be as your teacher
or your family.</b>

101
00:09:09,973 --> 00:09:11,308
<b>I'm fine.</b>

102
00:09:11,942 --> 00:09:13,788
<b>I just want to live as usual.</b>

103
00:09:13,812 --> 00:09:16,679
<b>Is it because Ji Won said
she doesn't want a brother?</b>

104
00:09:16,813 --> 00:09:19,082
<b>No one has to suffer
if we remain strangers.</b>

105
00:09:19,883 --> 00:09:20,884
<b>But you know what?</b>

106
00:09:21,429 --> 00:09:22,696
<b>If you were to...</b>

107
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,555
<b>live as you did in the past,</b>

108
00:09:26,164 --> 00:09:28,625
<b>what about the good things

109
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:30,509
<b>Won't they be gone?</b>

110
00:09:31,203 --> 00:09:33,171
<b>You were going to take
good care of her.</b>

111
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,898
<b>If that disappears,</b>

112
00:09:35,547 --> 00:09:37,434
<b>I think it'll be a shame.</b>

113
00:09:38,057 --> 00:09:39,617
<b>You just have to suffer
a little longer.</b>

114
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:41,304
<b>But...</b>

115
00:09:41,957 --> 00:09:44,853
<b>you'll be able to experience

<b>don't you think?</b>

117
00:09:49,383 --> 00:09:50,480
<b>Yes.</b>

118
00:09:57,977 --> 00:10:01,291
<b>Eun Ho, your mother dies

<b>What are you doing?</b>

120
00:10:08,172 --> 00:10:11,267
<b>I'm going to kill you both

121
00:10:11,534 --> 00:10:12,534
<b>Got it?</b>

122
00:10:15,516 --> 00:10:18,842
<b>Hee Dong, say hello to Eun Ho

<b>Eun Ho, now you remember everything,
don't you?</b>

124
00:10:34,457 --> 00:10:37,127
<b>- Just leave him alone.
- Again!</b>

125
00:10:38,461 --> 00:10:40,296
<b>Why do you and even Ki Ho...</b>

<b>Sun Woo,

128
00:10:46,069 --> 00:10:48,071
<b>to save Eun Ho?</b>

129
00:10:48,992 --> 00:10:51,341
<b>I'll go. Take me instead.</b>

130
00:10:51,641 --> 00:10:52,641
<b>Take you?</b>

131
00:10:53,181 --> 00:10:54,349
<b>Sun Woo.</b>

132
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:02,695
<b>Hey, you're worthless to me!</b>

133
00:11:02,719 --> 00:11:05,298
<b>Why on earth do you need him?</b>

<b>You forgot?

<b>So he's mine. Don't you get it?</b>

136

<b>Eun Ho, stop wasting my time

00:11:29,906 --> 00:11:31,147
<b>How annoying.</b>

142
00:11:33,437 --> 00:11:34,517
<b>Eun Ho, follow me.</b>

143

00:12:11,102 --> 00:12:12,956
<b>Fine. I'll stop.</b>

153

<b>You're good at drawing.</b>

<b>So you saw everything in the study.</b>

155

<b>Sang Ho, stop.</b>

159
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:58,375
<b>You'd better not do anything
to put a spoke in my wheel.</b>

160
00:12:58,735 --> 00:12:59,936
<b>Or your mom will be...</b>

161
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,540
<b>killed slowly by Hee Dong.</b>

162
00:13:05,429 --> 00:13:06,910
<b>Can you promise me?</b>

163
00:13:07,577 --> 00:13:08,578
<b>Yes.</b>

164
00:13:10,338 --> 00:13:12,682
<b>Then, never lay a hand on my mom.</b>

165
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:15,362
<b>Don't worry.</b>

166
00:13:15,386 --> 00:13:19,689
<b>Your mom is totally worthless to me.</b>

167
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:21,191
<b>Get changed.</b>

168
00:13:22,393 --> 00:13:24,060
<b>It's your first time leaving
the hospital.</b>

169
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,319
<b>- Yes, Mr. Lee.
- Sang Ho...</b>

170
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:25,955
<b>took Eun Ho with him.</b>

171
00:14:27,346 --> 00:14:29,025
<b>Please save Eun Ho.</b>

172
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:40,136
<b>(Eun Ho)</b>

173
00:14:42,557 --> 00:14:44,907
<b>(Soo Jung)</b>

174
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:51,214
<b>Cha Young Jin?</b>

175
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:52,982
<b>Cha Young Jin?</b>

176
00:14:54,198 --> 00:14:55,218
<b>Isn't it you?</b>

177
00:14:56,377 --> 00:14:57,377
<b>It is.</b>

178
00:15:00,783 --> 00:15:03,769
<b>The day that reminds us
of the old day came.</b>

179
00:15:03,794 --> 00:15:05,186
<b>How amazing.</b>

180
00:15:05,328 --> 00:15:06,362
<b>Put Eun Ho on the phone.</b>

181
00:15:06,494 --> 00:15:08,494
<b>What makes you think he's alive?</b>

182
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:11,291
<b>Because I said Soo Jung would
be the last victim?</b>

183
00:15:11,659 --> 00:15:13,580
<b>You didn't kill him.</b>

184
00:15:13,604 --> 00:15:16,472
<b>Are you trying to feel me out?
Or is that what you believe?</b>

185
00:15:16,572 --> 00:15:17,573
<b>If I were you,</b>

186
00:15:18,474 --> 00:15:20,220
<b>I wouldn't have finished this
that soon.</b>

187
00:15:20,244 --> 00:15:21,377
<b>Incredible.</b>

188
00:15:22,408 --> 00:15:23,446
<b>You're really good.</b>

189
00:15:25,081 --> 00:15:27,517
<b>Right. Eun Ho is alive.</b>

190
00:15:31,117 --> 00:15:32,908
<b>Now we should meet.</b>

191
00:15:37,923 --> 00:15:39,395
<b>I'll invite you to my place.</b>

192
00:15:40,416 --> 00:15:41,762
<b>I don't need any gift,</b>

193
00:15:41,786 --> 00:15:45,178
<b>but I recommend you come alone.</b>

194
00:15:45,202 --> 00:15:47,581
<b>My place is quite messy now.</b>

195
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:23,239
<b>I'll open all the doors for you.</b>

196
00:16:44,229 --> 00:16:47,463
<b>But you won't be able to open
the last one so easily.</b>

197
00:16:49,991 --> 00:16:52,835
<b>- Where should I go?
- You can't go anywhere.</b>

198
00:16:52,969 --> 00:16:56,583
<b>You shouldn't have come this far.
We all are over because of you.</b>

199
00:16:56,607 --> 00:16:59,141
<b>Where are Eun Ho and Sang Ho?</b>

200
00:17:00,854 --> 00:17:03,346
<b>You must have some difficulty
understanding what others say.</b>

201
00:17:03,646 --> 00:17:05,646
<b>I'll kill you with my hand.</b>

202
00:17:05,782 --> 00:17:08,117
<b>I have no time.
Just tell me where they are.</b>

203
00:18:32,846 --> 00:18:34,971
<b>- Open it.
- Then remove this first.</b>

204
00:18:35,707 --> 00:18:36,464
<b>No?</b>

205
00:18:36,488 --> 00:18:38,778
<b>Then pluck my eyeball out.</b>

206
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:01,791
<b>I guess Ms. Cha is really mad.</b>

207
00:19:03,268 --> 00:19:07,459
<b>Even if she's terrible at shooting,
Hee Dong is too big to miss, right?</b>

208
00:19:09,471 --> 00:19:10,471
<b>Eun Ho.</b>

209
00:19:11,752 --> 00:19:13,943
<b>Young Jin is no different from me.</b>

210
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:17,346
<b>She kills if she has a reason.</b>

211
00:19:19,189 --> 00:19:21,017
<b>This is my favorite tie.</b>

212
00:19:34,932 --> 00:19:38,548
<b>You can put handcuffs
on me and Doo Seok only.</b>

213
00:19:39,634 --> 00:19:42,711
<b>What? Now you want to shoot me?</b>

214
00:19:51,073 --> 00:19:53,649
<b>Sun Ah!</b>

215
00:19:53,929 --> 00:19:56,385
<b>Sun Ah!</b>

216
00:19:59,822 --> 00:20:01,268
<b>You can't call 911.</b>

217
00:20:08,215 --> 00:20:09,565
<b>Save her.</b>

218
00:20:10,066 --> 00:20:11,834
<b>Save her no matter what.</b>

219
00:20:22,511 --> 00:20:23,646
<b>It's the rooftop.</b>

220
00:20:46,678 --> 00:20:47,912
<b>Please.</b>

221
00:21:01,484 --> 00:21:02,485
<b>You're late this time.</b>

222
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:04,464
<b>Last time, you barged in
even before you were invited.</b>

223
00:21:04,488 --> 00:21:05,821
<b>Are you hurt?</b>

224
00:21:06,777 --> 00:21:08,758
<b>- Drop your knife.
- No, your gun first.</b>

225
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:11,070
<b>Which one will be faster,
my knife or your gun?</b>

226
00:21:11,094 --> 00:21:12,995
<b>- Let Eun Ho go.
- I don't know.</b>

227
00:21:13,329 --> 00:21:16,209
<b>I doubt we can have a sound talk
without him.</b>

228
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:17,366
<b>Now, drop your gun.</b>

229
00:21:20,367 --> 00:21:22,197
<b>What are you doing
when the kid is watching?</b>

230
00:21:22,222 --> 00:21:24,336
<b>We know our situations,
so let's trust each other.</b>

231
00:21:24,403 --> 00:21:28,377
<b>Shouldn't you show him
the virtue of concession, Ms. Cha?</b>

232
00:21:36,713 --> 00:21:37,713
<b>Drop it.</b>

233
00:21:40,056 --> 00:21:41,157
<b>One more round.</b>

234
00:21:47,129 --> 00:21:48,297
<b>Drop your knife.</b>

235
00:21:55,337 --> 00:21:58,707
<b>You can't last forever
with that empty gun!</b>

236
00:21:59,643 --> 00:22:01,744
<b>You're never disappointing.</b>

237
00:22:02,776 --> 00:22:05,448
<b>You know I have no intention
of killing Eun Ho.</b>

238
00:22:05,855 --> 00:22:08,217
<b>The moment he jumped off here,</b>

239
00:22:10,019 --> 00:22:11,898
<b>I fell for this guy.</b>

240
00:22:11,922 --> 00:22:13,088
<b>Put your hands off him.</b>

241
00:22:15,491 --> 00:22:19,061
<b>We're only loving him
in our own way.</b>

242
00:22:19,858 --> 00:22:22,542
<b>Let him go. This talk is about us.</b>

243
00:22:22,566 --> 00:22:26,168
<b>Really? He already knows everything
about Choi Soo Jung's case.</b>

244
00:22:27,336 --> 00:22:31,106
<b>You shouldn't have told
such a horrible story to a kid.</b>

245
00:22:31,273 --> 00:22:34,086
<b>That's ruining his soul.</b>

246
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:35,745
<b>So from now on,</b>

247
00:22:36,137 --> 00:22:37,784
<b>let's talk alone without him.</b>

248
00:22:37,808 --> 00:22:38,925
<b>No, it's late.</b>

249
00:22:38,949 --> 00:22:42,918
<b>He's gotten strong already.
He's much stronger than you think.</b>

250
00:22:43,052 --> 00:22:45,120
<b>He's something.</b>

251
00:22:46,901 --> 00:22:48,023
<b>In my study,</b>

252
00:22:48,341 --> 00:22:52,061
<b>he noticed who I was, but walked
out of there nonchalantly.</b>

253
00:22:52,695 --> 00:22:55,174
<b>Then he jumped off here to run away.</b>

254
00:22:55,198 --> 00:22:56,575
<b>You know
what's even more impressive?</b>

255
00:22:56,599 --> 00:22:59,735
<b>He let the rope go
in order not to get caught.</b>

256
00:23:02,051 --> 00:23:04,540
<b>This kid is unbelievable.</b>

257
00:23:05,741 --> 00:23:08,477
<b>So don't worry,
and let him hear our talk.</b>

258
00:23:08,778 --> 00:23:10,913
<b>Where were we?</b>

259
00:23:11,479 --> 00:23:14,260
<b>I was telling Eun Ho
about Hee Jung's last moment.</b>

260
00:23:14,284 --> 00:23:15,995
<b>If we change the topic here, he'll
be so curious about what comes next.</b>

261
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:17,986
<b>Besides, the story gets exciting
from now on.</b>

262
00:23:21,094 --> 00:23:22,992
<b>Because Young Jin appears.</b>

263
00:23:23,159 --> 00:23:26,996
<b>Now we need to choose whom to bless.</b>

264
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:29,885
<b>It should be...</b>

265
00:23:30,065 --> 00:23:32,868
<b>the friend of Soo Jung
whom you killed.</b>

266
00:23:36,405 --> 00:23:37,406
<b>That woman...</b>

267
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:40,476
<b>will be a witness
to testify the resurrection.</b>

268
00:23:42,346 --> 00:23:45,948
<b>Her name is Cha Young Jin.
She's still looking for you.</b>

269
00:23:46,115 --> 00:23:47,293
<b>It was also her...</b>

270
00:23:47,317 --> 00:23:50,029
<b>who talked on the phone
with me 19 years ago.</b>

271
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:52,021
<b>And she lied...</b>

272
00:23:52,162 --> 00:23:53,355
<b>that the stigmata...</b>

273
00:23:54,206 --> 00:23:55,591
<b>will happen again.</b>

274
00:23:55,854 --> 00:23:57,393
<b>How surprising.</b>

275
00:23:57,793 --> 00:23:59,662
<b>She's still looking for me.</b>

276
00:24:00,432 --> 00:24:01,407
<b>Good.</b>

277
00:24:01,431 --> 00:24:04,266
<b>She should be the witness.</b>

278
00:24:12,174 --> 00:24:15,411
<b>Father, I have more to tell you.</b>

279
00:24:15,711 --> 00:24:17,590
<b>My sin is too big...</b>

280
00:24:17,614 --> 00:24:19,415
<b>to ask you for forgiveness.</b>

281
00:24:20,088 --> 00:24:22,685
<b>Please save me from my pain...</b>

282
00:24:23,783 --> 00:24:25,187
<b>and complete the resurrection.</b>

283
00:24:25,387 --> 00:24:27,364
<b>Do you mean it?</b>

284
00:24:27,388 --> 00:24:28,367
<b>Yes.</b>

285
00:24:28,391 --> 00:24:30,937
<b>Like Francis of Assisi...</b>

286
00:24:30,961 --> 00:24:33,138
<b>who received the stigmata
from the angel with six wings,</b>

287
00:24:33,162 --> 00:24:34,330
<b>give me...</b>

<b>I'll be born again like those

<b>I'll lead them at the front...</b>

291

<b>and show everyone in the world...</b>

<b>- give me the blessing of stigmata.
- No.</b>

<b>The miracle of the resurrection...</b>

297

00:26:58,908 --> 00:27:00,762
<b>I mean, you saved a stranger
down on the street...</b>

315
00:27:00,786 --> 00:27:02,869
<b>and even followed him
to the hospital.</b>

316
00:27:03,045 --> 00:27:04,246
<b>But you...</b>

317
00:27:06,479 --> 00:27:08,417
<b>lived in a house downstairs
from Young Jin's.</b>

318
00:27:08,491 --> 00:27:11,987
<b>I thought it was
an amusing coincidence up to there.</b>

319

<b>But you two are friends.</b>

320
00:27:15,891 --> 00:27:16,936
<b>I think...</b>

321
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,628
<b>I was meant to kill Soo Jung...</b>

322

<b>Eun Ho.</b>

324
00:27:25,935 --> 00:27:29,271
<b>If Young Jin died instead
and you met Soo Jung,</b>

325
00:27:29,779 --> 00:27:31,219
<b>what kind of a kid would you be now?</b>

326
00:27:32,573 --> 00:27:33,876
<b>One thing is certain.</b>

<b>You wouldn't have

<b>She was next to me,

00:37:06,278 --> 00:37:07,262
<b>Keep going.</b>

467
00:37:07,287 --> 00:37:08,838
<b>You must have waited for me...</b>

468
00:37:08,863 --> 00:37:11,178
<b>at my house on the day
the picture went missing.</b>

469
00:37:11,464 --> 00:37:14,864
<b>You changed your mind for some
reason and only took the picture.</b>

470
00:37:14,889 --> 00:37:16,682
<b>That was on the evening
of July 31, 2000.</b>

471
00:37:16,707 --> 00:37:18,879
<b>And you killed her the next evening.</b>

472
00:37:19,457 --> 00:37:22,731
<b>The murder was on August 1, 2000
at midnight.</b>

473
00:37:23,371 --> 00:37:26,551
<b>What did it feel like when you heard
the statute of limitations expired?</b>

474
00:37:27,027 --> 00:37:29,332
<b>If you killed me as you planned,</b>

475
00:37:29,357 --> 00:37:31,357
<b>the statute of limitations might
have expired.</b>

476
00:37:31,382 --> 00:37:33,127
<b>But you chose to kill Soo Jung
the next day,</b>

477
00:37:33,152 --> 00:37:34,817
<b>and it's still in effect.</b>

478
00:37:36,239 --> 00:37:39,547
<b>Do you still think
it was a wise choice?</b>

479
00:37:40,574 --> 00:37:42,356
<b>I had to endure
every day of my life.</b>

480
00:37:43,105 --> 00:37:45,121
<b>If I caught you after
the statute of limitations expired,</b>

481
00:37:45,145 --> 00:37:48,067
<b>my only option would be to kill you.
But fortunately,</b>

482
00:37:49,364 --> 00:37:51,137
<b>I was given another choice.</b>

483
00:37:51,403 --> 00:37:53,228
<b>Why did I switch to Soo Jung?</b>

484
00:37:53,352 --> 00:37:56,006
<b>Because she had friends
other than you,</b>

485
00:37:56,030 --> 00:37:58,239
<b>but she was your only friend.</b>

486
00:37:58,894 --> 00:37:59,786
<b>What?</b>

487
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:03,471
<b>I thought about which will make
someone suffer longer,</b>

488
00:38:03,825 --> 00:38:05,020
<b>and it was you.</b>

489
00:38:05,504 --> 00:38:07,715
<b>That's why I decided
to let you live.</b>

490
00:38:09,933 --> 00:38:13,660
<b>What would you have done without me?</b>

491
00:38:13,684 --> 00:38:15,684
<b>My life would be
a lot quieter than now.</b>

492
00:38:15,895 --> 00:38:16,895
<b>I'm hanging up.</b>

493
00:38:17,762 --> 00:38:19,663
<b>Is that what you told her?</b>

494
00:38:19,687 --> 00:38:21,043
<b>Of course.</b>

495
00:38:21,067 --> 00:38:24,359
<b>It'd be too harsh to die
without knowing the reason.</b>

496
00:38:24,684 --> 00:38:27,086
<b>- The third call.
- That was from me.</b>

497
00:38:28,429 --> 00:38:31,065
<b>I really didn't want to
tell you this story.</b>

498
00:38:31,543 --> 00:38:34,293
<b>This is what I told her
before I called.</b>

499
00:38:36,801 --> 00:38:38,934
<b>"I'll let you go
if your friend picks up."</b>

500
00:38:39,214 --> 00:38:42,010
<b>I could see hope sparkle in her eyes
as I said that.</b>

501
00:38:42,074 --> 00:38:44,473
<b>Hope that she might be able to live.</b>

502
00:38:45,155 --> 00:38:47,011
<b>But you never answered the phone.</b>

503
00:38:47,036 --> 00:38:48,590
<b>If I answered,</b>

504
00:38:49,754 --> 00:38:51,653
<b>were you really going to let her go?</b>

505
00:38:51,678 --> 00:38:53,504
<b>No way.</b>

506
00:38:53,528 --> 00:38:55,824
<b>She knows my face and my name.</b>

507
00:38:56,012 --> 00:38:59,793
<b>Because she had hope
that she might be able to make it,</b>

508
00:39:00,512 --> 00:39:03,004
<b>her pain and despair must have
gotten bigger.</b>

509
00:39:05,379 --> 00:39:07,277
<b>I promise you, I'm going to...</b>

510
00:39:07,301 --> 00:39:08,637
<b>"Kill you."</b>

511
00:39:09,762 --> 00:39:13,241
<b>"I'll find you even if it'd take
my whole life."</b>

512
00:39:14,293 --> 00:39:16,559
<b>"So make sure you stay alive
until then."</b>

513
00:39:20,681 --> 00:39:22,850
<b>Come to think of it, maybe...</b>

514
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:26,161
<b>I've been waiting for this moment
from that point on.</b>

515
00:39:28,903 --> 00:39:30,207
<b>Now it's time to execute.</b>

516
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:33,761
<b>- We need to end this, right?
- I'm not...</b>

517
00:39:35,363 --> 00:39:37,192
<b>the old Cha Young Jin anymore.</b>

518
00:39:42,286 --> 00:39:43,411
<b>Or are you?</b>

519
00:39:52,113 --> 00:39:55,418
<b>Her last words she left you are
recorded here.</b>

520
00:39:56,028 --> 00:39:57,684
<b>Yes, it still works.</b>

521
00:39:58,465 --> 00:39:59,614
<b>Let me listen to it.</b>

522
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:01,621
<b>Will you be okay?</b>

523
00:40:01,825 --> 00:40:03,926
<b>I'll find out after I listen to it.</b>

524
00:40:09,473 --> 00:40:12,000
<b>Can I talk to my family?</b>

525
00:40:13,090 --> 00:40:14,114
<b>Mom...</b>

526
00:40:15,106 --> 00:40:17,939
<b>and Dad, thank you.</b>

527
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:22,443
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

528
00:40:24,879 --> 00:40:27,081
<b>Please don't be so sad.</b>

529
00:40:29,348 --> 00:40:30,848
<b>Young Jin.</b>

530
00:40:33,926 --> 00:40:35,442
<b>Like you said,</b>

531
00:40:36,254 --> 00:40:38,626
<b>I'm angry and frustrated...</b>

532
00:40:39,762 --> 00:40:42,864
<b>that this will be the last moment
of my life.</b>

533
00:40:46,489 --> 00:40:47,957
<b>So...</b>

534
00:40:50,598 --> 00:40:54,342
<b>I decided to think...</b>

535
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:58,856
<b>about happy and fun memories only.</b>

536
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,684
<b>You're also part of them.</b>

537
00:41:48,379 --> 00:41:49,676
<b>No!</b>

538
00:42:05,793 --> 00:42:07,403
<b>I'll kill you...</b>

539
00:42:08,449 --> 00:42:10,038
<b>as you wish!</b>

540
00:42:12,394 --> 00:42:13,411
<b>Let's make it straight.</b>

541
00:42:14,215 --> 00:42:17,692
<b>That's what you want.
Revenge for Soo Jung's death...</b>

542
00:42:17,933 --> 00:42:20,128
<b>and the reward
for this meaningless life.</b>

543
00:42:24,809 --> 00:42:26,629
<b>What's stopping you?</b>

544
00:42:26,926 --> 00:42:28,336
<b>Say you want me to save you.</b>

545
00:42:28,361 --> 00:42:30,138
<b>Just get it over with it.</b>

546
00:42:30,171 --> 00:42:31,661
<b>Say: "Save me."</b>

547
00:42:33,067 --> 00:42:36,177
<b>"Please save me."</b>

548
00:42:36,425 --> 00:42:37,860
<b>"Please."</b>

549
00:42:39,106 --> 00:42:42,250
<b>"Don't kill me."</b>

550
00:42:46,028 --> 00:42:48,856
<b>This is the last word Soo Jung said.</b>

551
00:42:49,316 --> 00:42:50,658
<b>As she said that,</b>

552
00:42:50,903 --> 00:42:54,129
<b>her small heart that was palpitating
like a bird caught in hands...</b>

553
00:42:56,128 --> 00:42:57,732
<b>stopped.</b>

554
00:43:01,153 --> 00:43:02,286
<b>Fine.</b>

555
00:43:03,207 --> 00:43:04,520
<b>I'll let you go...</b>

556
00:43:06,379 --> 00:43:07,590
<b>to hell.</b>

557
00:43:29,481 --> 00:43:30,887
<b>Let's go home.</b>

558
00:43:47,090 --> 00:43:48,989
<b>Don't be scared.</b>

559
00:43:49,637 --> 00:43:53,321
<b>I'm here to save you.</b>

560
00:43:53,684 --> 00:43:57,043
<b>You're chosen by me.</b>

561
00:43:57,426 --> 00:43:58,879
<b>Sang Ho.</b>

562
00:43:59,605 --> 00:44:01,696
<b>Come closer and watch.</b>

563
00:44:03,332 --> 00:44:04,668
<b>How grateful.</b>

564
00:44:05,879 --> 00:44:09,103
<b>- It's not too late.
- Let me finish this pain.</b>

565
00:44:23,739 --> 00:44:25,253
<b>If it'd been you,</b>

566
00:44:27,129 --> 00:44:29,157
<b>would my life have changed?</b>

567
00:44:45,856 --> 00:44:47,059
<b>Sang Ho.</b>

568
00:44:47,918 --> 00:44:50,293
<b>On suspicions of abducting
and assaulting a minor,</b>

569
00:44:51,379 --> 00:44:52,379
<b>and...</b>

570
00:44:55,418 --> 00:44:57,536
<b>murdering Choi Soo Jung,
you're under arrest.</b>

571
00:44:59,043 --> 00:45:01,879
<b>You have the right to remain silent
and have an attorney.</b>

572
00:45:02,528 --> 00:45:04,528
<b>You have the right
not to incriminate yourself.</b>

573
00:45:25,261 --> 00:45:26,278
<b>Where's Eun Ho?</b>

574
00:45:27,699 --> 00:45:28,762
<b>He's fine.</b>

575
00:45:29,934 --> 00:45:31,652
<b>Don't worry. Just rest.</b>

576
00:45:38,786 --> 00:45:40,528
<b>You'll regret
making the wrong choice...</b>

577
00:45:40,552 --> 00:45:42,552
<b>every time you wake up
in the morning.</b>

578
00:45:43,684 --> 00:45:44,950
<b>What about his secretary?</b>

579
00:45:44,981 --> 00:45:46,817
<b>She's out of immediate danger.</b>

580
00:45:46,981 --> 00:45:48,536
<b>We arrested Hee Dong too.</b>

581
00:45:48,903 --> 00:45:51,551
<b>- What is she talking about?
- Hee Dong must've made it in time.</b>

582
00:45:52,129 --> 00:45:54,129
<b>I let him go so that he could
save your secretary.</b>

583
00:45:54,988 --> 00:45:58,012
<b>Both of them aren't dead?</b>

584
00:45:58,269 --> 00:45:59,856
<b>No one died.</b>

585
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:13,728
<b>- Are you okay?
- Yes.</b>

586
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:18,408
<b>- Are you all right?
- I am.</b>

587
00:46:18,432 --> 00:46:19,634
<b>I will never be late again.</b>

588
00:46:20,207 --> 00:46:22,895
<b>You were never late.
It's just I never waited for you.</b>

589
00:46:23,870 --> 00:46:24,941
<b>I will...</b>

590
00:46:26,246 --> 00:46:27,692
<b>try to wait for you now.</b>

591
00:46:36,614 --> 00:46:38,778
<b>I'm sorry
I let you go through all this.</b>

592
00:46:41,316 --> 00:46:43,316
<b>As long as I have
a superhero neighbor,</b>

593
00:46:44,973 --> 00:46:46,145
<b>it's unavoidable.</b>

594
00:46:46,887 --> 00:46:49,520
<b>- What?
- You're my hero.</b>

595
00:46:51,231 --> 00:46:53,968
<b>- It's cringy.
- I'm glad...</b>

596
00:46:54,926 --> 00:46:56,504
<b>you're smiling again.</b>

597
00:47:39,809 --> 00:47:41,989
<b>Eun Ho and I are both fine.</b>

598
00:47:42,488 --> 00:47:45,219
<b>- How are you feeling?
- It hurts so bad.</b>

599
00:47:46,903 --> 00:47:49,161
<b>It's the most painful time
in my life.</b>

600
00:47:50,121 --> 00:47:52,270
<b>I thought you were only bluffing...</b>

601
00:47:53,473 --> 00:47:56,879
<b>when you said you'd rather hurt
yourself if someone has to get hurt.</b>

602
00:47:57,223 --> 00:47:58,574
<b>But you really meant it.</b>

603
00:47:58,598 --> 00:48:00,817
<b>I never knew it'd hurt this much.</b>

604
00:48:06,761 --> 00:48:09,043
<b>- I hope you get better soon.
- Where are you going?</b>

605
00:48:09,286 --> 00:48:11,178
<b>- Home.
- What about Eun Ho?</b>

606
00:48:11,278 --> 00:48:13,514
<b>- He's home.
- Ms. Cha.</b>

607
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:18,371
<b>Thank you.</b>

608
00:49:30,298 --> 00:49:32,526
<b>(April)</b>

609
00:50:25,746 --> 00:50:27,948
<b>Hi, you're early.</b>

610
00:50:30,629 --> 00:50:32,586
<b>Eun Ho, is it fun?</b>

611
00:50:32,611 --> 00:50:34,655
<b>- Yes.
- Enjoy.</b>

612
00:50:35,245 --> 00:50:37,126
<b>- Let me borrow it later.
- Sure.</b>

613
00:50:47,776 --> 00:50:51,058
<b>The foundation will be separated
from the church.</b>

614
00:50:51,276 --> 00:50:53,843
<b>- That's good.
- We can't set up a college either.</b>

615
00:50:54,222 --> 00:50:56,222
<b>It was my father-in-law's wish.</b>

616
00:50:56,761 --> 00:50:59,894
<b>That place is yours. I'm his son,
but it slipped even through my ears.</b>

617
00:50:59,994 --> 00:51:01,681
<b>So why cherish it so much?</b>

618
00:51:02,377 --> 00:51:05,088
