<b>Then instead of saying you haven't shopped in a while,</b>

127

00:12:30,826 --> 00:12:31,826
<b>As for Hwang Mi Soon...</b>

162
00:12:32,966 --> 00:12:35,936
<b>Let's skip Plan C.</b>

163
00:12:36,497 --> 00:12:37,637
<b>Let's move onto Plan D.</b>

164
00:12:37,737 --> 00:12:39,166
<b>Why skip Plan C?</b>

165
00:12:39,737 --> 00:12:42,507
<b>You saw what just happened. It won't work.</b>

166
00:12:43,277 --> 00:12:44,847
<b>I'll begin Plan D.</b>

167
00:12:46,446 --> 00:12:48,147
<b>Hello? Is this Wash and Clean?</b>

168
00:12:53,416 --> 00:12:55,456
<b>(Good Casting)</b>

169
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:58,026
<b>The ultimate goal of this mission...</b>

170
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:00,026
<b>is to stop the technology from leaking overseas.</b>

171
00:13:00,027 --> 00:13:02,295
<b>And we also need to catch Michael, the industrial spy...</b>

172
00:13:02,296 --> 00:13:04,897
<b>that the Industry Security Team always failed to catch.</b>

173
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:06,526
<b>What's the update?</b>

174
00:13:06,527 --> 00:13:08,335
<b>According to Team Three,</b>

175
00:13:08,336 --> 00:13:10,097
<b>there will be three transactions in total.</b>

176
00:13:10,367 --> 00:13:12,137
<b>They're going to back up their data.</b>

177
00:13:12,507 --> 00:13:15,607
<b>It looks like the first transaction was made during the explosion.</b>

178
00:13:16,436 --> 00:13:17,812
<b>So we need to stop the second transaction.</b>

179
00:13:17,836 --> 00:13:19,407
<b>Do you have any information about that?</b>

180
00:13:22,477 --> 00:13:24,516
<b>It's planned to be fully developed in a month.</b>

181
00:13:24,517 --> 00:13:27,185
<b>It's highly likely that they'll try to sell the information before that.</b>

182
00:13:27,186 --> 00:13:29,756
<b>So we need to infiltrate Il Kwang Hitech before that...</b>

183
00:13:29,757 --> 00:13:31,262
<b>and gather information about who, where, and when...</b>

184
00:13:31,286 --> 00:13:33,086
<b>and stop the transaction from happening.</b>

185
00:13:33,127 --> 00:13:34,487
<b>Who's our mark?</b>

186
00:13:34,696 --> 00:13:37,056
<b>Why don't you just do this yourself?</b>

187
00:13:37,227 --> 00:13:39,996
<b>If I was the team manager, the briefing would already be over,</b>

188
00:13:39,997 --> 00:13:41,637
<b>and we would already be out in the field.</b>

189
00:13:42,397 --> 00:13:46,637
<b>So, who is our mark?</b>

190
00:13:48,007 --> 00:13:49,076
<b>There are three.</b>

191
00:13:49,377 --> 00:13:51,877
<b>3-on-3 sounds great.</b>

192
00:13:52,176 --> 00:13:54,006
<b>The first mark.</b>

193
00:13:54,007 --> 00:13:55,075
<b>(Il Kwang Hitech)</b>

194
00:13:55,076 --> 00:13:56,316
<b>CEO Yoon Seok Ho.</b>

195
00:13:56,517 --> 00:13:58,116
<b>The official successor.</b>

196
00:13:58,117 --> 00:14:00,046
<b>(CEO Yoon Seok Ho)</b>

197
00:14:00,987 --> 00:14:02,086
<b>Yoon Seok Ho?</b>

198
00:14:05,326 --> 00:14:06,386
<b>He worked abroad...</b>

199
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:08,425
<b>and became CEO just a year ago.</b>

200
00:14:08,426 --> 00:14:09,597
<b>He's still green.</b>

201
00:14:09,657 --> 00:14:10,897
<b>Thanks for coming.</b>

202
00:14:16,036 --> 00:14:18,767
<b>Il Kwang's true big shot is Director Myeong Gye Cheol.</b>

203
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:20,666
<b>He controls the board.</b>

204
00:14:23,076 --> 00:14:24,237
<b>Hello.</b>

205
00:14:26,477 --> 00:14:27,907
<b>Congratulations.</b>

206
00:14:31,747 --> 00:14:34,415
<b>Director Myeong's right-hand man is Chief Tak Sang Gi.</b>

207
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:36,216
<b>He takes care of everything.</b>

208
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:39,227
<b>Remember him. He's someone we must watch.</b>

209
00:14:39,686 --> 00:14:41,325
<b>This Director Myeong...</b>

210
00:14:41,326 --> 00:14:43,656
<b>looks like an old tiger that lost all its teeth.</b>

211
00:14:43,657 --> 00:14:46,997
<b>How powerful is he that he has more influence than a relative?</b>

212
00:14:47,326 --> 00:14:48,766
<b>He's as cunning as a snake.</b>

213
00:14:48,767 --> 00:14:51,166
<b>He never leaves any files to trace.</b>

214
00:14:51,436 --> 00:14:53,805
<b>He uses burner phones and an external flash drive.</b>

215
00:14:53,806 --> 00:14:56,406
<b>Other than the official company email his secretary handles,</b>

216
00:14:56,407 --> 00:14:58,107
<b>he doesn't have a personal one.</b>

217
00:14:58,407 --> 00:15:01,045
<b>In other words, he has no shadow.</b>

218

<b>(Director Myeong Gye Cheol)</b>

<b>The more secrets they have, the more fun it is to go digging.</b>

220
00:15:08,056 --> 00:15:09,585
<b>I see the gold vein.</b>

221
00:15:09,586 --> 00:15:11,085
<b>According to an inside source,</b>

222
00:15:11,086 --> 00:15:13,955
<b>CEO Yoon is in constant touch with Taiwan...</b>

223
00:15:13,956 --> 00:15:16,397
<b>and travels there often in an unofficial capacity.</b>

224
00:15:16,527 --> 00:15:18,965
<b>So? Don't you smell it?</b>

225
00:15:18,966 --> 00:15:21,835
<b>It stinks all the way over here.</b>

226
00:15:21,836 --> 00:15:25,007
<b>The better-looking one is for their position,</b>

227
00:15:25,237 --> 00:15:27,206
<b>the more they stink.</b>

228

<b>Between Director Myeong and CEO Yoon...</b>

<b>is this man.</b>

<b>Isn't that Kang Woo Won, the celebrity?</b>

231

<b>You all know him.</b>

232
00:15:39,186 --> 00:15:41,456
<b>Kang Woo Won is the hottest star of the Korean wave.</b>

233
00:15:41,786 --> 00:15:43,856
<b>He's really popular in East Asia,</b>

234
00:15:43,857 --> 00:15:45,987
<b>especially in China and Taiwan.</b>

235
00:15:46,286 --> 00:15:48,757
<b>He flies to Taiwan at least every two months,</b>

236

<b>making him the ideal person to sneak...</b>

<b>CEO Yoon, Director Myeong, Kang Woo Won.</b>

239

<b>One of them is definitely connected to Michael.</b>

240

<b>Or they could be Michael.</b>

<b>What about me?</b>

<b>You can't even eat from a table we set up.</b>

<b>Where will you put it?</b>

249
00:16:27,897 --> 00:16:29,335
<b>The research lab, obviously.</b>

250
00:16:29,336 --> 00:16:32,035
<b>You need an entrance code to get into the research lab.</b>

251

<b>It's reset every morning.</b>

<b>You have to get into CEO Yoon's office to change it.</b>

<b>His office has a two-fold system. Facial recognition...</b>

<b>Hey! Bring the suitcase right now! Hurry up!</b>

<b>I get sick whenever I eat it.</b>

<b>You added too much spice.</b>

<b>- That's...

00:55:34,979 --> 00:55:36,878
<b>The technological advancements are outstanding.</b>

786
00:55:37,078 --> 00:55:40,318
<b>The cameras don't even need wires now.</b>

787

<b>Sweet.</b>

788
00:55:55,699 --> 00:55:56,729
<b>Why is it stuck?</b>

789
00:56:37,139 --> 00:56:40,337
<b>Mr. Dong, what is Ok Cheol doing here at this hour?</b>

790
00:56:40,338 --> 00:56:41,378
<b>What?</b>

<b>(The signal is weak. Please try again.)</b>

792

<b>You've got to be kidding me.</b>

793
00:56:59,028 --> 00:57:03,229
<b>Come on, Wi-Fi signal. Come on.</b>

794
00:57:07,838 --> 00:57:09,368
<b>(Il Kwang Hitech)</b>

795
00:57:12,838 --> 00:57:14,979
<b>- Hello, sir.
- Get back to work, guys.</b>

796
00:57:16,509 --> 00:57:17,978
<b>One moment, sir.</b>

797

<b>What was that?</b>

801
00:58:00,288 --> 00:58:02,489
<b>Budge, you stubborn thing.</b>

802

<b>(10 years ago)</b>

806
00:59:16,169 --> 00:59:17,628
<b>Why did you want to see me?</b>

807
00:59:18,699 --> 00:59:20,198
<b>Let's order some coffee first.</b>

808
00:59:20,199 --> 00:59:21,837
<b>I'm in the middle of an operation...</b>

<b>and I need to hurry back.</b>

810
00:59:25,979 --> 00:59:28,479
<b>Can you put your gun away first?</b>

811

<b>Remove the fork and knife too.</b>

812

<b>What's this about?</b>

813
00:59:40,689 --> 00:59:42,788
<b>We... Well...</b>

<b>Right.</b>

815

<b>Thank you.</b>

816
00:59:54,598 --> 00:59:56,838
<b>We what?</b>

817
00:59:56,939 --> 00:59:59,678
<b>I'll tell you after we finish this.</b>

818

<b>What is it?</b>

<b>- Go ahead.
- It's nothing.</b>

822
01:00:23,298 --> 01:00:25,998
<b>And here I thought you got all serious...</b>

823

<b>to say that you're breaking up with me.</b>

824

<b>What's with that expression?</b>

825
01:00:33,409 --> 01:00:34,479
<b>Well,</b>

826
01:00:35,409 --> 01:00:36,409
<b>you see,</b>

827
01:00:37,078 --> 01:00:39,148
<b>I've thought long and hard.</b>

<b>Then think some more.</b>

829
01:00:45,348 --> 01:00:46,358
<b>No,</b>

830
01:00:47,618 --> 01:00:48,958
<b>I've thought it through.</b>

831

<b>So what are you saying?</b>

<b>Let's break up.</b>

833

<b>You just had to say it, didn't you?</b>

834
01:01:17,548 --> 01:01:19,868
<b>You paid a fine for damaged property last month, remember?</b>

835
01:01:20,389 --> 01:01:22,189
<b>Didn't you say you were working an operation?</b>

836

<b>You would say weird excuses and hang up,</b>

<b>not smile at me,</b>

<b>not spend time with me,</b>

<b>and go off the grid.</b>

840
01:01:33,939 --> 01:01:37,239
<b>Even when you avoided me at work, I tried to brush it off.</b>

841
01:01:38,338 --> 01:01:40,178
<b>I don't care if you're seeing another woman...</b>

842
01:01:40,278 --> 01:01:41,678
<b>or if you've changed your mind about me.</b>

<b>You're a disloyal jerk.</b>

<b>Right.</b>

<b>I'm a scumbag.</b>

<b>For the record,</b>

<b>you're dumping me.</b>

848

<b>It's not the other way around.</b>

849

<b>how I treat those who've wronged me.</b>

853

<b>Of course. Don't I know it.</b>

854
01:02:09,139 --> 01:02:11,638
<b>You have three seconds to run. After that, you're dead.</b>

<b>3, 2, 1.</b>

<b>- Isn't Mi Soon back yet?
- My arms are numb.</b>

860
01:02:35,858 --> 01:02:37,468
<b>Find Mi Soon right now.</b>

861
01:02:37,469 --> 01:02:39,067
<b>Is anyone there?</b>

862
01:02:39,068 --> 01:02:40,138
<b>Found her.</b>

863
01:02:40,139 --> 01:02:42,708
<b>- Have them enter.
- Okay, got it.</b>

864
01:02:42,709 --> 01:02:44,367
<b>Find and press the reboot button.</b>

865
01:02:44,368 --> 01:02:46,008
<b>- It's the red one.
- Seriously?</b>

866
01:02:46,009 --> 01:02:47,009
<b>Something doesn't feel right.</b>

867
01:02:47,010 --> 01:02:48,438
<b>I think she took a photo of me that day.</b>

868
01:02:48,439 --> 01:02:49,478
<b>What do you say to a meal?</b>

869
01:02:49,479 --> 01:02:50,479
<b>Tak Sang Gi.</b>

870
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:53,218
<b>His scarf is the same brand as Michael Lee's.</b>

<b>Infiltrate Tak Sang Gi's office.</b>

872

<b>Are you sure you're 29?</b>

873
01:02:55,919 --> 01:02:57,488
<b>And your name is really Baek Jang Mi?</b>

874
01:02:57,489 --> 01:02:58,587
<b>Yes, that's right.</b>

875
01:02:58,588 --> 01:03:00,658
<b>Baek Jang Mi used to work for the NIS.</b>

<b>But I don't keep anyone I don't trust close by.</b>
