00:00:07,777 --> 00:00:09,006
Hello.

2
00:00:09,346 --> 00:00:11,676
I'm the guy who's dating Yeong.

3
00:00:16,256 --> 00:00:17,387
Seo Yeon and I...

4
00:00:18,087 --> 00:00:19,087
Right.

5
00:00:20,686 --> 00:00:23,056
I'm the guy who's dating Yeong.

6
00:00:25,297 --> 00:00:26,527
I...

7
00:00:29,166 --> 00:00:31,236
love her a lot.

8
00:00:50,486 --> 00:00:52,157
You remembered, didn't you?

9
00:00:55,087 --> 00:00:56,297
Then...

10
00:00:57,626 --> 00:01:00,297
you can't do this to Seo Yeon.

(Yeo Ha Kyung)

12
00:01:10,177 --> 00:01:11,177
One second.

13
00:01:12,477 --> 00:01:15,177
- Yes, Anchor Lee.
- Tell Ha Jin to leave right away.

14
00:01:15,177 --> 00:01:17,216
She's doing a fan signing event.
She'll be done soon.

15
00:01:17,216 --> 00:01:18,847
I have no time to explain.

16
00:01:18,847 --> 00:01:20,946
You have to stop the event
and get her out of there now.

17
00:01:29,397 --> 00:01:30,696
(Yeo Ha Jin's Fan Signing Event)

18
00:01:36,737 --> 00:01:38,337
- What?
- Ha Jin!

19
00:01:38,337 --> 00:01:39,737
- Ha Jin!
- Ha Jin!

20
00:01:39,737 --> 00:01:41,166
- Ha Jin!
- Ha Jin!

21
00:01:41,166 --> 00:01:43,136
- Ha Jin!
- Ha Jin, what's wrong?

22
00:01:43,237 --> 00:01:45,677
- Wake up, Ha Jin. Hey.
- Ha Jin!

23
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:47,647
Can someone call 911?

(Find Me in Your Memory)

25
00:02:04,026 --> 00:02:05,727
(Episode 25)

26
00:02:09,837 --> 00:02:10,897
Ha Kyung.

27
00:02:11,337 --> 00:02:12,567
You're here.

28
00:02:12,597 --> 00:02:13,767
What happened?

29
00:02:13,966 --> 00:02:16,637
Nothing's particularly wrong
with her.

30
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:19,577
She must have been overwhelmed
with a lot of work lately.

31
00:02:24,316 --> 00:02:26,917
Did you see anyone suspicious
during the fan signing event?

32
00:02:27,716 --> 00:02:31,417
There was a huge crowd,
and no one stood out.

33
00:02:31,417 --> 00:02:34,526
Today, a lifer ran away
from the National Forensic Hospital.

34
00:02:35,186 --> 00:02:38,927
He ran away in that direction,
so I got worried and called you.

35
00:02:39,427 --> 00:02:42,767
This isn't a dangerous situation
for her, is it?

36
00:02:43,436 --> 00:02:45,936
Don't worry.
He'll be caught very soon.

37
00:02:47,137 --> 00:02:48,137
I see.

38
00:03:24,737 --> 00:03:26,947
You won't have any trouble
with your everyday life...

39
00:03:27,077 --> 00:03:29,776
if you continue to do
your rehabilitation exercise.

40
00:03:44,596 --> 00:03:45,596
Ha Na.

41
00:03:47,167 --> 00:03:48,667
I can do this by myself.

42
00:03:50,496 --> 00:03:52,367
Right. I'm sorry.

43
00:03:59,207 --> 00:04:01,276
I can do this by myself, so go.

44
00:04:10,286 --> 00:04:11,286
I'm sorry.

45
00:04:32,137 --> 00:04:34,747
But sadly,

46
00:04:35,007 --> 00:04:37,747
you won't be able
to do ballet again.

47
00:05:13,247 --> 00:05:14,387
Hey, Jeong Hoon.

48
00:05:17,616 --> 00:05:19,726
I'm at Ha Na's hospital.

49
00:05:20,757 --> 00:05:22,957
Yes. I think so.

50
00:05:26,697 --> 00:05:29,596
Ha Jin, where are you going
at this hour?

51
00:05:30,567 --> 00:05:32,796
Yeong was here,

52
00:05:34,207 --> 00:05:36,276
but I avoided seeing her again.

53
00:05:37,536 --> 00:05:39,507
She must be heartbroken
because of me.

54
00:05:40,406 --> 00:05:42,676
It's late,
so let's call her again tomorrow.

55
00:05:43,517 --> 00:05:45,976
I mean, it wasn't her fault.

56
00:05:49,346 --> 00:05:50,887
Do you think she'll be back?

57
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:52,986
Of course.

58
00:05:53,187 --> 00:05:55,286
Don't worry about that
and go to sleep.

59
00:06:14,747 --> 00:06:15,947
Hello.

60
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:21,346
You're Yeo Ha Jin, aren't you?

61
00:06:22,447 --> 00:06:23,916
Who are you?

62
00:06:24,057 --> 00:06:26,856
Seo Yeon and I...

63
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:28,587
Right.

64
00:06:30,127 --> 00:06:32,426
I'm the guy who's dating Yeong.

65
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:41,507
I've heard a lot about you
from Seo Yeon.

66
00:06:41,507 --> 00:06:43,507
She said you're her best friend,

67
00:06:43,507 --> 00:06:46,747
and that you're
the most precious person to her.

68
00:06:48,147 --> 00:06:50,577
Yeong said that?

69
00:06:51,046 --> 00:06:53,346
Yes, so much so that I get jealous.

70
00:06:55,387 --> 00:06:58,286
Seo Yeon is the most precious to me.

71
00:06:59,356 --> 00:07:01,957
That's why
I always wanted to meet you.

72
00:07:02,557 --> 00:07:06,057
Right, and I have
a favor to ask of you.

73
00:07:06,466 --> 00:07:07,726
A favor?

74
00:07:08,966 --> 00:07:11,666
Seo Yeon and I got into a fight,

75
00:07:12,296 --> 00:07:13,707
and I wanted to make up with her,

76
00:07:14,036 --> 00:07:16,307
so I prepared a surprise for her.

77
00:07:16,507 --> 00:07:21,507
But I still don't know the passcode
to her practice room.

78
00:07:22,476 --> 00:07:26,416
I thought you might know,
so I wanted to ask you.

79
00:07:49,337 --> 00:07:50,707
Ha Jin, you're up.

80
00:07:50,707 --> 00:07:52,536
Are you feeling ill?
Are you all right?

81
00:07:53,077 --> 00:07:55,106
I have to go somewhere.
Can you drive me?

82
00:07:55,106 --> 00:07:56,106
Right now?

83
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:58,447
You can't go anywhere
in this condition.

84
00:07:59,817 --> 00:08:00,817
Ha Jin.

85
00:08:01,546 --> 00:08:02,546
Ha Jin!

86
00:08:02,986 --> 00:08:04,616
Why are you doing this?

87
00:08:04,616 --> 00:08:05,986
Why haven't you told me?

88
00:08:06,587 --> 00:08:09,726
Why did you lie to me?
Why did you let me forget? Why?

89
00:08:10,627 --> 00:08:11,627
Ha Jin...

90
00:08:12,457 --> 00:08:14,926
How could I forget Yeong?

91
00:08:17,736 --> 00:08:19,707
Don't you remember how Yeong died?

92
00:08:20,906 --> 00:08:23,736
Don't you know who caused her death
and why she died? How can I...

93
00:08:45,657 --> 00:08:47,466
I should visit her.

94
00:08:49,626 --> 00:08:50,697
Where was he last spotted?

95
00:08:51,037 --> 00:08:53,506
He was spotted three hours ago
at J Shopping Mall.

96
00:08:53,506 --> 00:08:54,937
That was the last of him.

97
00:08:55,037 --> 00:08:56,366
No one has spotted him ever since.

98
00:08:56,537 --> 00:08:58,476
The police put out an APB.

99
00:08:58,636 --> 00:09:00,646
Where have you been amidst all this?

100
00:09:00,646 --> 00:09:02,947
- Come join the meeting right now.
- Okay.

101
00:09:03,817 --> 00:09:06,846
The main news team didn't have
enough time,

102
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:09,917
so they're only going to brief
the viewers in the beginning.

103
00:09:10,486 --> 00:09:13,427
I think our program will have
to give an in-depth briefing.

104
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:15,527
That means this will be
breaking news.

105
00:09:15,527 --> 00:09:16,527
Right.

106
00:09:16,527 --> 00:09:19,057
Gosh, which news
am I supposed to omit?

107
00:09:20,027 --> 00:09:22,966
How about receiving
real-time reports from our viewers?

108
00:09:22,966 --> 00:09:24,697
Are you serious?

109
00:09:24,697 --> 00:09:28,907
Yes. Moon Seong Ho was arrested
for murder.

110
00:09:29,537 --> 00:09:33,207
We need to catch him
before he commits another murder.

111
00:09:34,106 --> 00:09:36,146
That is true.

112
00:09:36,476 --> 00:09:38,077
Since the police
have put out an APB,

113
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:40,087
let's ask them
to share their information.

114
00:09:40,087 --> 00:09:42,047
And let's ask for real-time reports.

115
00:09:42,846 --> 00:09:44,116
Do you think we have enough time?

116
00:09:44,116 --> 00:09:46,157
We can make time.

117
00:09:46,157 --> 00:09:48,557
But what if they catch him
before our news begins?

118
00:09:48,557 --> 00:09:50,226
I mean, that's good news.

119
00:09:50,226 --> 00:09:51,697
It won't be that easy.

120
00:09:52,197 --> 00:09:54,567
He risked his life
to escape from prison.

121
00:09:54,866 --> 00:09:57,067
He's going to hold out
until he gets what he wants.

122
00:09:57,136 --> 00:09:59,907
I'll report this to the higher-ups.

123
00:09:59,907 --> 00:10:02,606
First, contact the police...

124
00:10:02,606 --> 00:10:04,976
and look up information about him.

125
00:10:04,976 --> 00:10:07,677
Okay. I'll call the police.

126
00:10:07,677 --> 00:10:10,177
I'll look for a forensic artist.

127
00:10:10,177 --> 00:10:13,216
Wouldn't it be helpful to show
photos of him...

128
00:10:13,216 --> 00:10:15,746
with long hair or glasses?

129
00:10:15,746 --> 00:10:17,386
Smart move.

130
00:10:17,386 --> 00:10:20,986
If you have any other ideas,
share it with us.

131
00:10:21,187 --> 00:10:22,226
Let's get busy.

132
00:10:22,226 --> 00:10:23,256
Yes, ma'am.

133
00:10:44,317 --> 00:10:47,447
(Ha Jin)

134
00:11:08,106 --> 00:11:09,307
I'll wait here.

135
00:11:30,896 --> 00:11:33,057
(Jung Seo Yeon)

136
00:11:44,006 --> 00:11:45,106
I'm sorry.

137
00:11:49,707 --> 00:11:51,716
It took me so long, right?

138
00:11:59,057 --> 00:12:00,756
I'm truly sorry for being so late.

139
00:12:02,527 --> 00:12:03,927
I really am.

140
00:12:27,746 --> 00:12:28,746
Father.

141
00:12:30,657 --> 00:12:31,917
What happened?

142
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:34,986
The police called.
Did you get into an accident?

143
00:12:34,986 --> 00:12:38,726
It's only a mild concussion.
You don't need to worry.

144
00:12:39,596 --> 00:12:41,797
Did Jeong Hoon call you
by any chance?

145
00:12:42,096 --> 00:12:43,567
Why would he?

146
00:12:43,697 --> 00:12:47,866
Seo Yeon's stalker
escaped from prison.

147
00:12:48,407 --> 00:12:49,407
What?

148
00:12:49,407 --> 00:12:52,537
There's only one reason why
he'd escape.

149
00:12:53,376 --> 00:12:54,907
He probably wants
to avenge Seo Yeon.

150
00:12:55,646 --> 00:12:59,047
He's probably after Jeong Hoon
or Yeo Ha Jin.

151
00:13:00,246 --> 00:13:02,587
I didn't tell the police
about Jeong Hoon,

152
00:13:03,187 --> 00:13:07,057
so keep an eye on him.

153
00:13:08,327 --> 00:13:12,396
The stalker had harmed himself
in order to escape.

154
00:13:12,927 --> 00:13:15,167
I should've caught onto it.

155
00:13:15,866 --> 00:13:16,896
Let me get this right.

156
00:13:18,466 --> 00:13:20,907
Seo Yeon's murderer escaped,

157
00:13:21,866 --> 00:13:25,006
and you're involved in all this?

158
00:13:25,006 --> 00:13:26,746
That's not what's important
right now.

159
00:13:26,746 --> 00:13:29,677
How far are you going to take this?

160
00:13:30,277 --> 00:13:31,917
Are you sane?

161
00:13:32,846 --> 00:13:35,716
Do you even know how much danger
you had put yourself in?

162
00:13:35,716 --> 00:13:38,057
What were you planning to do
after meeting with the murderer?

163
00:13:38,057 --> 00:13:40,226
What's going on in your head?

164
00:13:40,327 --> 00:13:42,386
Don't you dare talk

something happens
to Jeong Hoon or Ha Jin,

I will never forgive you.

168
00:14:08,386 --> 00:14:10,687
Ha Jin, I'm coming in.

169
00:14:14,827 --> 00:14:15,827

Ha Jin.

171
00:14:23,866 --> 00:14:26,466
I'm going to open the door.

172
00:14:37,577 --> 00:14:39,417
Ha Jin, don't be like this.

173
00:14:42,246 --> 00:14:43,957
Are you going to repeat
what you did in the past?

174
00:14:44,116 --> 00:14:46,957
No sleep, no food. Are you going
to not take care of yourself?

175
00:14:48,356 --> 00:14:51,896
It's about time you stopped.
It's been eight years already.

176
00:14:51,896 --> 00:14:54,226
You should focus on yourself now.

They'll keep sending more,
so make sure you get them.

There's the number of the detective
who was in charge.

Okay.

Of course.
And a very competent one, at that.

188

I'll write up a list of questions
and give them to you.

Come on. I can do that much.

00:15:56,626 --> 00:15:59,996
Hello. You're calling
because of Moon Seong Ho, right?

196
00:16:00,697 --> 00:16:04,067
Yes. How did he escape?

197
00:16:04,466 --> 00:16:06,837
I believe he was already planning
an escape...

198
00:16:06,837 --> 00:16:09,167
when he had harmed himself.

199
00:16:09,407 --> 00:16:12,077
I should've known.

200
00:16:12,677 --> 00:16:15,907
We decided to talk about him
on our program.

that he caused himself?"

"What should we watch out for
if we run into him?"

205

as possible.

00:17:25,876 --> 00:17:27,017
What belongings?

213
00:17:27,587 --> 00:17:31,356
My old diary and the photos
Seo Yeon and I took.

214

Did you get rid of them?

Why do you ask?

216
00:17:40,426 --> 00:17:41,997
I guess you still have them.

Hi, Ha Jin.

226
00:19:12,616 --> 00:19:14,587
I got worried
when I couldn't reach you.

227
00:19:14,856 --> 00:19:16,557
Where are you?
Did you get discharged?

You said you got injured
and stopped doing ballet, right?

242
00:20:16,987 --> 00:20:19,087
Didn't you ask me once...

243
00:20:19,886 --> 00:20:21,426
if I knew Jung Seo Yeon?

244
00:20:23,386 --> 00:20:25,456
By Jung Seo Yeon, are we...

00:20:26,396 --> 00:20:28,426
talking about the same person
we both know?

that I was Seo Yeon's friend, right?

I wasn't trying to deceive you.

251
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:49,646
I wasn't sure
if telling you the truth...

252
00:20:49,886 --> 00:20:51,287
was the right thing to do.

253
00:20:53,557 --> 00:20:56,257
I shouldn't have asked you out.

254
00:20:57,027 --> 00:20:59,596
I should have stopped pursuing you
when you pushed me away.

255
00:21:00,626 --> 00:21:02,027
I am so sorry.

256
00:21:02,027 --> 00:21:04,436
I think I caused you a lot of pain
all this time.

No, it's not your fault.

258
00:21:06,366 --> 00:21:08,537
No, you don't know anything...

259
00:21:08,967 --> 00:21:10,577
and what I have done.

260
00:21:12,406 --> 00:21:15,446
I just realized
why it was hard to figure you out.

261
00:21:16,676 --> 00:21:19,676
It sounded like you were
always telling me the truth,

262
00:21:20,376 --> 00:21:22,317
but it didn't feel completely true.

263
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:25,886
It felt like
you were telling me a lot,

264
00:21:25,886 --> 00:21:28,456
but you weren't telling me anything
at the same time.

265
00:21:29,487 --> 00:21:31,257
It was all because of Seo Yeon.

266
00:21:32,227 --> 00:21:34,596
I finally learned
everything about you now.

267
00:21:36,527 --> 00:21:38,936
But I don't know what to do.

268
00:21:39,896 --> 00:21:43,237
I did expect that you would regain
your memory one day.

269
00:21:43,977 --> 00:21:45,436
My heart was always heavy...

270
00:21:45,636 --> 00:21:49,047
when I thought about the pain you'd
feel after getting your memory back.

271
00:21:49,606 --> 00:21:51,846
I'm sure you must be
very confused right now.

272
00:21:51,946 --> 00:21:54,146
But nothing will change, Ha Jin.

273
00:21:55,087 --> 00:21:56,686
It's all in the past.

274
00:21:56,987 --> 00:21:59,217
I really can't think right now.

275
00:22:01,186 --> 00:22:02,987
I don't know what to do.

276
00:22:07,126 --> 00:22:08,126

let me know right away. Okay?

- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

286
00:22:31,956 --> 00:22:33,557
Jeong Hoon gave me these photos.

287
00:22:33,557 --> 00:22:34,886
All of these photos?

288

Yes.

289
00:22:36,456 --> 00:22:38,196
My gosh,
this is what I hate that guy.

290
00:22:38,196 --> 00:22:39,856
He's too perfect.

291
00:22:39,856 --> 00:22:41,797
How did he get all of those photos?

292
00:22:41,797 --> 00:22:44,096
When he's done with his lines,
put these photos on the screen.

Yes, sir.

294
00:22:45,436 --> 00:22:48,936
Hey, Jeong Hoon. How did
you get all of those photos?

295
00:22:48,936 --> 00:22:50,837
I got the tip through
my personal connection.

296

I see. You're still a journalist
with connections.

The screenshot of the footage
is the most recent photo.

298
00:22:56,346 --> 00:22:58,916
When I checked, it was clearer
than the one from the CCTV.

299
00:22:59,146 --> 00:23:00,616
Use that as the main photo.

300
00:23:00,616 --> 00:23:02,846

at the National Forensic Hospital
escaped from a hospital...

310
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:24,106
- while he was being treated.
- Get his photo ready.

311
00:23:24,106 --> 00:23:27,507
As soon as the police received
the report, they put out an APB.

312
00:23:27,507 --> 00:23:30,446
They're using all of their resources
to locate Moon Seong Ho.

313
00:23:30,446 --> 00:23:33,146
However, they still haven't
located the prisoner.

314
00:23:33,146 --> 00:23:35,146
In an attempt to help
the nationwide search...

315
00:23:35,146 --> 00:23:37,146
and the police
to locate the prisoner,

316
00:23:37,146 --> 00:23:39,116
we will be taking calls
from the viewers.

317
00:23:39,116 --> 00:23:40,757

about the prisoner.

320

- This is the 40-year-old prisoner,
- Get the video ready.

321

- Play the video.
- Moon Seong Ho.

he was just leaving the hospital.

Please take a good look
at the man on the screen.

murdered a woman eight years ago...

and was locked up
at the National Forensic Hospital.

326
00:24:07,386 --> 00:24:09,717
- Yes. I see.
- His height is 180cm.

327
00:24:09,717 --> 00:24:11,317
- And he has a slim build.
- This is "News Live".

328
00:24:11,317 --> 00:24:14,156
- And he has gray hair.
- Yes. Go on.

329
00:24:14,156 --> 00:24:15,626
- Close up on his wrist injury.
- As for a distinctive feature,

330
00:24:15,626 --> 00:24:17,926
he has an old scar
on the left side of his neck.

331
00:24:17,926 --> 00:24:22,096
And he also has a recent injury
on this left wrist.

332
00:24:22,096 --> 00:24:25,666
It's been confirmed that
his mental state is very unstable.

333
00:24:25,666 --> 00:24:27,196
In order to catch
the prisoner swiftly,

334
00:24:27,196 --> 00:24:30,067
getting cooperation from the public
is the most important.

335
00:24:30,166 --> 00:24:32,876
Please take the initiative
to call us with any reports.

336
00:24:33,237 --> 00:24:35,846
- Hello? Yes.
- Hello.

337
00:24:35,846 --> 00:24:37,416
- This is "News Live".
- Did you get it?

338
00:24:37,416 --> 00:24:38,717
What's happening?

339
00:24:38,717 --> 00:24:41,547
A lot of people are calling
the police and our TV station.

340
00:24:41,547 --> 00:24:43,717
Answer them and give the police
any information we get.

341
00:24:43,717 --> 00:24:44,717
Okay.

342
00:24:44,956 --> 00:24:47,626
Hello? Yes. This is HBN News.

343
00:24:48,087 --> 00:24:51,497
Ma'am, you have to answer that.
You need to answer it.

344
00:24:52,196 --> 00:24:53,327
Hello, this is "News Live".

345
00:24:53,327 --> 00:24:56,967
A murderer who brutally
murdered a woman...

346
00:24:56,967 --> 00:24:59,067
escaped today.

347
00:24:59,636 --> 00:25:01,936
He managed to escape
from our legal system.

348
00:25:01,936 --> 00:25:05,577
And the man who inserted himself
among the people was smiling.

349
00:25:06,376 --> 00:25:10,876
Will you watch him point his knife
at another innocent victim?

350
00:25:11,116 --> 00:25:12,477
- Here.
- It's time for us...

351
00:25:12,477 --> 00:25:14,217
- It's 2 dollars and 20 cents.
- to make it aware...

352
00:25:14,416 --> 00:25:15,517
that Moon Seong Ho...

353
00:25:15,747 --> 00:25:17,916
is nothing
but a shameless prisoner...

354
00:25:17,916 --> 00:25:20,757
who won't be able to do anything.

355
00:25:21,356 --> 00:25:25,057
I'd like to ask for your cooperation
and attention to the manhunt.

356
00:25:25,057 --> 00:25:27,696
Excuse me.
I'll put them in a plastic bag.

357
00:25:27,696 --> 00:25:29,967
This is all for today.

358
00:25:30,527 --> 00:25:32,037
- Have a goodnight.
- Wait.

359
00:25:32,037 --> 00:25:33,037
Excuse me!

360
00:25:48,217 --> 00:25:49,346
We got a lot of reports,

361
00:25:49,346 --> 00:25:52,287
but we didn't get anything
to confirm his whereabouts.

362
00:25:52,287 --> 00:25:54,426
Nonetheless, a lot of people are
aware of his escape now.

363
00:25:54,426 --> 00:25:56,257
We'll be able to catch him soon.

364
00:25:56,257 --> 00:25:57,257
Thank you.

365
00:25:58,456 --> 00:26:00,797
You can thank me
after you catch him.

366
00:26:01,767 --> 00:26:03,767
Call me if there's progress.

367
00:26:03,767 --> 00:26:05,166
Okay, sure.

368
00:26:16,446 --> 00:26:18,346
You did very well with today's news.

369
00:26:18,346 --> 00:26:21,116
The more I think about it,
the more frustrating it seems.

370
00:26:21,116 --> 00:26:24,656
We could have gotten him
if they were a few minutes faster.

371
00:26:24,987 --> 00:26:28,186
We need to lock him up
before he harms innocent people.

372
00:26:28,727 --> 00:26:31,596
Why is our world filled
with crazy and bad people?

373
00:26:31,596 --> 00:26:33,727
Goodness. It's horrible.

374
00:26:34,527 --> 00:26:35,527
Thanks.

375
00:26:35,797 --> 00:26:37,067
Thank you.

376
00:26:38,067 --> 00:26:39,297
Please pour me one too.

377
00:26:49,277 --> 00:26:51,146
I guess something is up.

378
00:26:51,646 --> 00:26:52,946
A lot has happened.

379
00:26:53,446 --> 00:26:54,987
Too many things have happened.
That's the problem.

380
00:26:54,987 --> 00:26:57,047
Did you have a fight with Ha Jin?

381
00:26:57,287 --> 00:26:58,356
No. It's not that.

382
00:26:58,356 --> 00:27:00,717
Yes, that's it.

383
00:27:00,717 --> 00:27:01,886
Actually,

384
00:27:02,987 --> 00:27:04,196
there's a favor...

385
00:27:05,327 --> 00:27:07,866
I need to ask you
and confess something to you.

386
00:27:07,866 --> 00:27:10,027
A confession? What confession?

387
00:27:10,497 --> 00:27:12,267
The girl I used to date before...

388
00:27:13,096 --> 00:27:14,837
died because of Moon Seong Ho.

389
00:27:15,307 --> 00:27:16,436
What?

390
00:27:16,706 --> 00:27:18,037
That's why...

391
00:27:18,436 --> 00:27:21,606
I can't tell you that today's news
was completely professional.

392
00:27:21,606 --> 00:27:22,606
I'm sorry.

393
00:27:24,777 --> 00:27:26,646
But until Moon Seong Ho
gets arrested,

394
00:27:27,376 --> 00:27:30,317
I want to continue receiving calls.
Please let me do that.

395
00:27:30,317 --> 00:27:31,686
My gosh.

396
00:27:32,517 --> 00:27:34,156
How...

397
00:27:44,997 --> 00:27:46,067
Yes, Tae Eun.

398
00:27:47,497 --> 00:27:48,866
Did you watch the news?

399
00:27:49,666 --> 00:27:51,906
Are you worried
because Moon Seong Ho escaped?

400
00:27:53,206 --> 00:27:54,646
I'm sorry, Jeong Hoon.

401
00:27:55,307 --> 00:27:56,846
Why are you sorry?

402
00:27:56,846 --> 00:27:58,547
Moon Seong Ho escaped...

403
00:28:00,577 --> 00:28:01,916
because of my dad.

404
00:28:03,186 --> 00:28:05,317
My dad went to see him
as an outpatient.

405
00:28:06,416 --> 00:28:08,156
And he held my dad hostage.

406
00:28:08,156 --> 00:28:09,886
Is he hurt badly?

407
00:28:10,686 --> 00:28:11,926
No, he's okay.

408
00:28:12,156 --> 00:28:13,497
That's a relief.

409
00:28:14,967 --> 00:28:17,267
I didn't know
your dad was involved in this.

410
00:28:17,267 --> 00:28:18,567
Will you be okay?

411
00:28:18,567 --> 00:28:21,837
According to my dad, he'll probably
go to you or Ha Jin.

412
00:28:23,237 --> 00:28:24,606
Actually, he already did.

413
00:28:24,606 --> 00:28:27,206
Who? Ha Jin?

414
00:28:27,646 --> 00:28:28,646
Yes.

415
00:28:30,077 --> 00:28:32,517
That jerk showed up
in front of Ha Jin.

416
00:28:33,446 --> 00:28:35,886
Please don't tell me she did.

417
00:28:35,886 --> 00:28:36,886
She did.

418
00:28:38,116 --> 00:28:39,456
Her memories came back.

419
00:28:41,987 --> 00:28:43,856
She's in a lot of pain
and confusion.

420
00:28:44,757 --> 00:28:47,827
Does she know
about you and Seo Yeon too?

421
00:28:49,366 --> 00:28:50,396
Yes.

422
00:28:53,896 --> 00:28:57,366
I want to run over to see her
and stay by her side,

423
00:28:59,676 --> 00:29:01,876
but I'd be asking for too much
if I do that right now.

424
00:29:02,906 --> 00:29:04,277
I'd be way too selfish.

425
00:29:07,717 --> 00:29:10,247
It must be tormenting for her
to see me right now,

426
00:29:11,487 --> 00:29:13,116
so I'm just waiting.

427
00:29:15,626 --> 00:29:18,297
I thought time is
what she needs the most right now.

428
00:29:28,136 --> 00:29:29,666
I knew this would happen in the end.

429
00:29:31,537 --> 00:29:33,037
Who have I been blaming for this?

430
00:30:02,567 --> 00:30:03,906
We can't do this.

431
00:30:05,176 --> 00:30:06,307
Why not?

432
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:10,507
We'll regret it.

433
00:30:11,577 --> 00:30:13,146
I won't regret anything.

434
00:30:17,956 --> 00:30:19,287
You will.

435
00:30:20,386 --> 00:30:22,186
You might regret this
more than I would.

436
00:30:53,587 --> 00:30:55,787
I finally learned
everything about you now.

437
00:30:57,896 --> 00:31:00,227
But I don't know what to do.

438
00:31:01,596 --> 00:31:03,926
I can't even bear to stand here
and look at you right now.

439
00:31:12,337 --> 00:31:13,706
(Ha Jin)

440
00:31:17,706 --> 00:31:18,817
Yes, Ha Jin.

441
00:31:26,086 --> 00:31:28,185
It's really great weather.

442
00:31:33,326 --> 00:31:34,556
Have you been well?

443
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:36,625
Are you feeling all right?

444
00:31:36,625 --> 00:31:37,896
(Episode 26)

445
00:31:38,795 --> 00:31:41,766
I'm feeling okay.
As you can see, I'm doing well.

446
00:31:47,766 --> 00:31:50,806
I wanted to see you
because I had to tell you something.

447
00:31:52,435 --> 00:31:54,846
I thought about this a lot
and came to this decision,

448
00:31:54,846 --> 00:31:57,375
so I hope
you could respect my decision.

449
00:32:01,746 --> 00:32:03,085
Let's go back to the time...

450
00:32:04,015 --> 00:32:05,926
when we weren't in any relationship,

451
00:32:07,055 --> 00:32:08,585
no, when we didn't know each other.

452
00:32:12,665 --> 00:32:14,526
It's not your fault.

453
00:32:15,265 --> 00:32:18,295
It's just that
I can't stay by your side.

454
00:32:18,695 --> 00:32:20,506
So let's stop here.

455
00:32:20,506 --> 00:32:21,506
No.

456
00:32:23,576 --> 00:32:24,975
I can't do that.

457
00:32:26,206 --> 00:32:27,376
I told you.

458
00:32:28,846 --> 00:32:30,975
I love you very much.

459
00:32:32,945 --> 00:32:34,486
I know it'll be really tough.

460
00:32:34,615 --> 00:32:36,355
I know that you'll need time.

461
00:32:37,786 --> 00:32:39,585
So let's bear through this together.

462
00:32:42,186 --> 00:32:43,355
I don't want to.

463
00:32:45,225 --> 00:32:47,396
I don't want to be a bad person.

464
00:32:47,695 --> 00:32:49,335
What makes you a bad person?

465
00:32:51,236 --> 00:32:52,396
Because of me, Seo Yeon...

466
00:32:52,396 --> 00:32:54,506
Why is that because of you?

467
00:32:55,706 --> 00:32:58,135
Her stalker is the one at fault,
not you.

468
00:32:59,135 --> 00:33:01,275
You were only deceived too.

469
00:33:02,006 --> 00:33:03,245
You are...

470
00:33:04,745 --> 00:33:07,885
just another victim
who lost a precious friend to him.

471
00:33:10,456 --> 00:33:12,085
You knew?

472
00:33:14,656 --> 00:33:16,855
Yet you stayed by my side?

473
00:33:19,225 --> 00:33:22,096
No one has any right to blame you.

474
00:33:23,296 --> 00:33:25,335
So please don't be hard on yourself.

475
00:33:25,335 --> 00:33:27,335
Don't forgive me that easily.

476
00:33:28,835 --> 00:33:31,876
That makes me feel
even sorrier for you...

477
00:33:33,006 --> 00:33:34,376
and for Seo Yeon.

478
00:33:36,575 --> 00:33:38,415
Don't worry about me anymore.

479
00:33:40,246 --> 00:33:42,216
I can't make any rash decisions now.

480
00:33:43,716 --> 00:33:46,586
I feel way too sorry for you
to do anything like that.

481
00:33:50,156 --> 00:33:52,156
I'll be very busy from now on.

482
00:33:52,895 --> 00:33:56,596
I probably can't stop myself
from thinking about you,

483
00:33:59,295 --> 00:34:00,705
but I'll try my best.

484
00:34:03,906 --> 00:34:05,806
So let's stop here.

485
00:34:10,515 --> 00:34:11,575
Ha Jin.

486
00:34:15,616 --> 00:34:17,015
You promised...

487
00:34:18,256 --> 00:34:20,225
never to say goodbye.

488
00:34:28,966 --> 00:34:30,096
I'm sorry.

489
00:34:32,966 --> 00:34:34,966
I don't think I can keep my promise.

490
00:34:58,756 --> 00:35:00,596
Ms. Park, you're here.

491
00:35:01,295 --> 00:35:02,366
Where's Ha Jin?

492
00:35:02,765 --> 00:35:04,066
She's in her room,

493
00:35:04,066 --> 00:35:06,466
but she must be asleep.
She has been pretty quiet.

494
00:35:06,836 --> 00:35:08,336
Is she all right?

495
00:35:08,836 --> 00:35:11,906
I'm not sure.
She looks fine on the outside,

496
00:35:11,906 --> 00:35:13,445
but that makes me feel
even more nervous.

497
00:35:13,675 --> 00:35:16,316
I feel so bad for our dear Ha Jin.

498
00:35:16,316 --> 00:35:18,776
I'm sorry we ended up
making you worried too.

499
00:35:18,776 --> 00:35:20,445
Don't be sorry.

500
00:35:20,445 --> 00:35:22,515
It's not like
I didn't know about this.

501
00:35:22,515 --> 00:35:26,355
You already told me everything
about Ha Jin from the beginning.

502
00:35:27,186 --> 00:35:30,895
That's when I realized
how much you love her...

503
00:35:30,895 --> 00:35:33,026
and how considerate you are.

504
00:35:33,026 --> 00:35:35,395
You said you wanted her to be happy,

505
00:35:35,395 --> 00:35:37,695
and you asked me
to make her into an actress...

506
00:35:37,695 --> 00:35:40,135
because she's a person
who shines very brightly.

507
00:35:40,566 --> 00:35:42,566
Thank you so much
for accepting her back then.

508
00:35:42,566 --> 00:35:44,936
Don't say that.
I'm thankful for her.

509
00:35:45,676 --> 00:35:47,345
I never thought of you two...

510
00:35:47,345 --> 00:35:50,246
just as my business partners.

511
00:35:50,246 --> 00:35:52,015
You seem like my daughters,

512
00:35:52,015 --> 00:35:53,885
so I'm always worried about you.

513
00:35:53,885 --> 00:35:55,986
You two are both way too kind.

514
00:35:58,385 --> 00:36:00,056
I thought you were asleep.

515
00:36:00,885 --> 00:36:02,085
You're here, Ms. Park.

516
00:36:02,085 --> 00:36:04,856
Hey, Ha Jin.
I brought some side dishes.

517
00:36:05,895 --> 00:36:08,025
Ms. Park,
I have a favor to ask of you.

518
00:36:08,195 --> 00:36:09,566
Do you want to get some rest?

519
00:36:09,566 --> 00:36:12,195
Yes, you probably should
get some rest for a while.

520
00:36:12,496 --> 00:36:14,506
I'll keep your drama schedule,

521
00:36:14,506 --> 00:36:16,275
but I'll drop everything else.

522
00:36:16,876 --> 00:36:18,775
Can you get me more work?

523
00:36:19,306 --> 00:36:21,246
I want to be extremely busy...

524
00:36:21,246 --> 00:36:22,806
to not think of anything else.

525
00:36:39,926 --> 00:36:41,066
We look so good.

526
00:36:56,046 --> 00:36:57,476
This is unfair.

527
00:36:58,445 --> 00:37:01,046
Why am I always home alone?

528
00:37:14,525 --> 00:37:15,866
There you go again.

529
00:37:16,695 --> 00:37:18,236
You're not picking up.

530
00:37:37,056 --> 00:37:38,155
What time is it?

531
00:37:41,426 --> 00:37:42,825
(Jo Il Kwon)

532
00:37:43,955 --> 00:37:46,895
I'm in front of your house.
I'll be waiting until you come out.

533
00:38:09,686 --> 00:38:11,416
Why did you come all the way here?

534
00:38:12,455 --> 00:38:15,385
What took you so long?
I thought you weren't coming.

535
00:38:23,895 --> 00:38:25,635
Did I do something wrong?

536
00:38:26,866 --> 00:38:30,075
If I did, tell me.
I promise I can change.

537
00:38:30,606 --> 00:38:33,246
They say people don't change easily,
but I'm different.

538
00:38:34,075 --> 00:38:35,246
I can change very easily.

539
00:38:35,246 --> 00:38:37,645
What are you talking about?
You did nothing wrong.

540
00:38:40,445 --> 00:38:41,715
Then...

541
00:38:42,686 --> 00:38:44,585
If you've developed feelings
for someone else...

542
00:38:47,426 --> 00:38:49,726
Don't go. I'll do better.

543
00:38:49,825 --> 00:38:51,356
I'll work out much more.

544
00:38:51,356 --> 00:38:52,595
It's not that.

545
00:38:52,595 --> 00:38:54,195
Then what's wrong?

546
00:38:54,195 --> 00:38:56,126
You neither pick up my calls
nor reply to my texts.

547
00:38:56,296 --> 00:38:58,035
You say you're too busy to meet.

548
00:38:58,135 --> 00:38:59,166
About that...

549
00:39:00,205 --> 00:39:01,866
I'm sorry.

550
00:39:02,306 --> 00:39:05,405
Do you not like me anymore?

551
00:39:05,405 --> 00:39:06,945
That's definitely not true.

552
00:39:08,676 --> 00:39:09,715
Something just...

553
00:39:11,046 --> 00:39:12,515
came up.

554
00:39:15,215 --> 00:39:17,116
I had no idea.

555
00:39:18,316 --> 00:39:19,515
Is everything okay?

556
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:23,895
She's fine. She's smiling again.

557
00:39:23,895 --> 00:39:25,356
She's working hard as well.

558
00:39:26,095 --> 00:39:27,366
But I feel anxious.

559
00:39:27,866 --> 00:39:30,566
I'm afraid she's crying
on the inside.

560
00:39:30,566 --> 00:39:34,606
No. I'm asking about you.
Are you okay?

561
00:39:35,705 --> 00:39:36,705
What?

562
00:39:39,876 --> 00:39:41,306
It must've been tough.

563
00:39:44,616 --> 00:39:47,046
I'm fine. Ha Jin's the one
who had it rough.

564
00:39:47,046 --> 00:39:48,885
My suffering is nothing
compared to hers.

565
00:39:51,916 --> 00:39:54,785
I'm sure she and Jeong Hoon
are both having a rough time.

566
00:39:56,596 --> 00:39:58,196
But I'm worried about you the most.

567
00:39:59,126 --> 00:40:00,966
You matter the most to me.

568
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:05,895
You must've kept this
all to yourself up until now.

569
00:40:06,866 --> 00:40:08,765
I'm sure you were suffering.

570
00:40:12,476 --> 00:40:14,846
Tell me whenever you're going
through a rough patch.

571
00:40:15,645 --> 00:40:17,116
I want to be there for you.

572
00:40:20,385 --> 00:40:21,415
Okay.

573
00:40:22,415 --> 00:40:23,486
Okay.

574
00:40:25,216 --> 00:40:27,885
Shall we cheer ourselves up
with something tasty?

575
00:40:27,885 --> 00:40:30,395
I'm not hungry.
I'm not craving anything.

576
00:40:31,555 --> 00:40:34,596
Then shall we have a drink,
your favorite?

577
00:40:34,596 --> 00:40:36,935
You can't even drink well.
No, thanks.

578
00:40:38,366 --> 00:40:40,265
This won't do. Follow me.

579
00:40:40,265 --> 00:40:41,805
- Why?
- Hurry up.

580
00:40:41,805 --> 00:40:43,706
- Where are we going?
- Just follow me.

581
00:40:58,315 --> 00:41:00,856
This is the best thing you can do
when you feel frustrated.

582
00:41:01,956 --> 00:41:03,596
Shout until your throat gives out.

583
00:41:03,696 --> 00:41:05,425
- What?
- Come on.

584
00:41:05,496 --> 00:41:08,366
Look straight ahead
and shout for 10 seconds!

585
00:41:11,196 --> 00:41:12,466
I can't do it.

586
00:41:19,905 --> 00:41:22,706
Do it. It's really effective.

587
00:41:23,815 --> 00:41:25,675
Ready, set, go.

588
00:41:28,116 --> 00:41:30,216
What was that?
Were you calling out for someone?

589
00:41:31,256 --> 00:41:34,155
Where's all that power you had
when you subdued me? Summon that.

590
00:41:34,155 --> 00:41:35,155
- Okay?
- All right.

591
00:41:35,155 --> 00:41:37,895
Okay. Let's do it once more.
Ready, set, go.

592
00:41:38,596 --> 00:41:42,795
Jo Il Kwon! You're an idiot!

593
00:41:44,665 --> 00:41:47,106
Why am I an idiot?

594
00:41:47,765 --> 00:41:50,236
You're an even bigger idiot
than I am!

595
00:41:55,175 --> 00:41:58,275
- This is nice.
- Yes, it is.

596
00:42:20,135 --> 00:42:22,535
(You will understand me as well.)

597
00:42:24,736 --> 00:42:26,206
(You should lose someone you love.)

598
00:42:26,206 --> 00:42:27,976
(Don't kid yourself.)

599
00:42:30,376 --> 00:42:33,216
(You will be punished.)

600
00:42:39,415 --> 00:42:41,326
("Moon Seong Ho Has Run Away,
Possibility of Another Victim")

601
00:42:43,356 --> 00:42:45,756
(Wanted: Escaped Prisoner)

602
00:42:54,506 --> 00:42:55,506
Hello, Father.

603
00:42:55,565 --> 00:42:56,675
Are you busy?

604
00:42:56,905 --> 00:42:58,076
I can talk.

605
00:42:58,836 --> 00:43:00,145
I'm sorry about last time.

606
00:43:00,846 --> 00:43:03,545
Don't drink too much.
You should take care of your body.

607
00:43:04,275 --> 00:43:06,815
Okay. Are you all right?

608
00:43:07,986 --> 00:43:08,986
Yes.

609
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:11,116
I'd like to meet...

610
00:43:12,116 --> 00:43:13,986
your girlfriend.

611
00:43:14,986 --> 00:43:16,925
Can you make some time?

612
00:43:18,425 --> 00:43:19,826
Okay.

613
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:23,366
I'll call you again. Goodbye.

614
00:43:38,576 --> 00:43:39,576
What is this for?

615
00:43:39,846 --> 00:43:42,946
You seem exhausted these days.
It's on me.

616
00:43:44,116 --> 00:43:45,185
Thanks.

617
00:43:47,055 --> 00:43:49,856
How is everything with Ha Kyung?

618
00:43:49,856 --> 00:43:51,356
It's great.

619
00:43:52,395 --> 00:43:54,265
But we rarely meet these days,

620
00:43:54,366 --> 00:43:56,196
thanks to Ha Jin.

621
00:43:57,435 --> 00:43:58,466
Right.

622
00:43:59,265 --> 00:44:00,736
Anyway, thanks.

623
00:44:00,736 --> 00:44:01,765
No problem.

624
00:44:19,155 --> 00:44:21,456
1, 2. Good. 1, 2.

625
00:44:22,226 --> 00:44:24,295
That's good. 1, 2.

626
00:44:24,895 --> 00:44:25,895
Good.

627
00:44:26,596 --> 00:44:27,696
Great.

628
00:44:29,265 --> 00:44:31,836
All right, then.
Let's change her clothes.

629
00:44:39,206 --> 00:44:42,506
Don't I seem too stiff?
Should I smile?

630
00:44:42,506 --> 00:44:45,976
No, I like it.
You look relaxed and charismatic.

631
00:44:46,515 --> 00:44:48,586
Can I see the previous photos?

632
00:44:48,586 --> 00:44:49,586
Okay.

633
00:44:58,655 --> 00:45:00,295
Can I have some water?

634
00:45:03,966 --> 00:45:06,265
You haven't eaten anything.
Do you want some snacks?

635
00:45:06,265 --> 00:45:07,466
Later.

636
00:45:08,006 --> 00:45:10,206
Yu Jin, can I see the photos
you took back there?

637
00:45:10,206 --> 00:45:11,236
Here you go.

638
00:45:19,415 --> 00:45:21,145
That was quick.

639
00:45:21,145 --> 00:45:24,685
I'd like to change the concept
and incorporate some items.

640
00:45:24,685 --> 00:45:26,015
What do you think?

641
00:45:29,486 --> 00:45:31,456
Since I'm a news anchor,
should I sit down?

642
00:45:31,456 --> 00:45:32,726
That's brilliant.

643
00:45:32,826 --> 00:45:36,196
You seem to really love your role.

644
00:45:37,496 --> 00:45:38,966
I do.

645
00:45:39,565 --> 00:45:42,336
- Okay. Please prepare a chair.
- Yes, ma'am.

646
00:45:47,305 --> 00:45:48,305
1, 2.

647
00:46:07,565 --> 00:46:10,135
(It's chilly today.
Make sure to dress warmly.)

648
00:46:14,336 --> 00:46:18,535
(My feelings will never change.
I'll be waiting for you.)

649
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:35,756
(Is everything all right?
I miss you.)

650
00:46:51,175 --> 00:46:52,706
Let me see all the calls
we got so far.

651
00:46:54,106 --> 00:46:55,206
This is it.

652
00:46:59,346 --> 00:47:00,645
Okay. Thank you.

653
00:47:06,116 --> 00:47:08,126
Ha Jin, we're going home.

654
00:47:08,126 --> 00:47:09,626
I want to work out.

655
00:47:09,626 --> 00:47:11,326
Drop me off, and you can go.

656
00:47:11,726 --> 00:47:13,295
You've been working
since the morning.

657
00:47:13,295 --> 00:47:15,466
Don't overwork yourself.
Get some rest.

658
00:47:17,366 --> 00:47:19,565
I'll sleep better
once I run for a bit.

659
00:47:23,466 --> 00:47:24,535
Okay.

660
00:47:38,986 --> 00:47:40,756
(Doctor Yoo)

661
00:47:46,596 --> 00:47:48,096
Come on.

662
00:47:48,596 --> 00:47:51,236
- Hello.
- My gosh, Anchor Lee.

663
00:47:51,366 --> 00:47:53,096
Any update on Moon Seong Ho?

664
00:47:53,366 --> 00:47:55,065
He's still on the run.

665
00:47:55,065 --> 00:47:57,175
I'm not sure if that jerk knows
where we're searching...

666
00:47:57,175 --> 00:48:00,006
or if he's just getting lucky
when he's moving around.

667
00:48:00,275 --> 00:48:01,545
But we're still pursuing him.

668
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:04,145
I'm sure it will
mentally pressure him.

669
00:48:04,246 --> 00:48:05,846
Okay. Right.

670
00:48:06,175 --> 00:48:08,746
He might be quiet now,
but we don't know what he might do.

671
00:48:08,746 --> 00:48:12,685
Right. So we must try harder
to catch him, right?

672
00:48:12,685 --> 00:48:14,626
We'll call you if we get a lead.

673
00:48:14,626 --> 00:48:15,626
- Okay.
- Bye.

674
00:48:26,196 --> 00:48:27,666
You're early.

675
00:48:28,335 --> 00:48:29,335
Hi.

676
00:48:32,335 --> 00:48:34,605
You wanted to see me
because you were worried, right?

677
00:48:35,845 --> 00:48:37,015
I'm sorry.

678
00:48:37,115 --> 00:48:38,946
Why are you sorry?

679
00:48:40,146 --> 00:48:41,886
You didn't give me these memories.

680
00:48:42,646 --> 00:48:44,386
These were my memories,
to begin with.

681
00:48:45,886 --> 00:48:48,226
I just found my place now.

682
00:48:50,496 --> 00:48:52,625
I'm fine. Don't worry.

683
00:48:52,625 --> 00:48:54,196
But you're not okay.

684
00:48:54,365 --> 00:48:55,996
If it's hard, you can say it is.

685
00:48:55,996 --> 00:48:57,466
Cry if you want to.

686
00:48:57,466 --> 00:49:00,535
That way, people around you
can comfort you. That way,

687
00:49:01,966 --> 00:49:03,775
I won't be a fool like before...

688
00:49:04,736 --> 00:49:07,176
and finally do something for you.

689
00:49:10,545 --> 00:49:12,676
I'm really okay, Doctor Yoo.

690
00:49:13,845 --> 00:49:15,386
I'm handling it.

691
00:49:17,386 --> 00:49:20,186
Are you trying your best
to endure this pain...

692
00:49:22,226 --> 00:49:23,896
out of guilt...

693
00:49:24,696 --> 00:49:26,456
or for the sake of Jeong Hoon?

694
00:49:29,295 --> 00:49:31,436
When you came to me a while ago...

695
00:49:31,936 --> 00:49:34,236
and told me that you had dreams
about your past,

696
00:49:34,565 --> 00:49:36,206
to be honest, I was very worried...

697
00:49:37,006 --> 00:49:38,676
in case you got your memories back.

698
00:49:40,075 --> 00:49:43,006
So I told Jeong Hoon
to break up with you.

699
00:49:44,476 --> 00:49:47,916
I said you might be remembering
your past because he was with you.

700
00:49:48,386 --> 00:49:49,686
So I told him to stop.

701
00:49:52,015 --> 00:49:53,926
But Jeong Hoon told me...

702
00:49:55,355 --> 00:49:57,896
that he didn't want to hide
because he was scared.

703
00:49:59,555 --> 00:50:02,025
Even if you get your memories back
and have a hard time,

704
00:50:03,295 --> 00:50:05,095
he said he wanted
to stay by your side.

705
00:50:09,736 --> 00:50:12,605
Is that what Anchor Lee said?

706
00:50:13,006 --> 00:50:14,006
Yes.

707
00:50:15,906 --> 00:50:18,115
I've been his friend
for a very long time.

708
00:50:18,646 --> 00:50:20,275
I've never seen him
so determined like that day.

709
00:50:21,216 --> 00:50:22,585
I know that...

710
00:50:23,315 --> 00:50:25,355
it took a lot of courage
for him to decide that.

711
00:50:27,926 --> 00:50:29,386
Ha Jin,

712
00:50:30,055 --> 00:50:31,825
don't get scared and hide.

713
00:50:32,896 --> 00:50:34,095
Be courageous.

714
00:51:26,045 --> 00:51:27,986
She's an anchor in the drama,

715
00:51:27,986 --> 00:51:30,615
so going with
a sophisticated career woman...

716
00:51:30,615 --> 00:51:33,416
might be a win-win for both of us.

717
00:51:33,926 --> 00:51:37,095
Secret tips on how to take care of
yourself from a career woman.

718
00:51:37,726 --> 00:51:38,795
I like it.

719
00:51:39,095 --> 00:51:41,265
I think we settled on the concept.

720
00:51:41,265 --> 00:51:44,035
Once you give us the draft,
we'll check it and call you.

721
00:51:44,035 --> 00:51:45,365
Okay. Let's do that.

722
00:51:45,966 --> 00:51:50,305
Can you also think
about sponsorships for the drama?

723
00:51:50,575 --> 00:51:54,305
Ha Jin, you're so invested
in this drama.

724
00:51:54,646 --> 00:51:57,275
This drama is all I have right now.

725
00:51:57,946 --> 00:52:00,345
Are you sure you want to cut it?
Won't you regret it?

726
00:52:00,345 --> 00:52:03,315
The writer said
you could just tie it up neatly.

727
00:52:03,315 --> 00:52:05,686
Since I'm going with a new image,
I want to do it right.

728
00:52:05,686 --> 00:52:07,926
Isn't it better
with a visible change?

729
00:52:07,926 --> 00:52:09,456
Yes, it is.

730
00:52:09,886 --> 00:52:11,956
But it took so long
to grow your hair.

731
00:52:12,325 --> 00:52:13,825
Can you reconsider?

732
00:52:13,825 --> 00:52:16,095
I'll be okay. Please cut it.

733
00:52:16,765 --> 00:52:18,295
Will this do?

734
00:52:18,295 --> 00:52:20,335
No, that's too short.

735
00:52:20,335 --> 00:52:22,265
No. We need to get an offer
for a shampoo commercial.

736
00:52:22,265 --> 00:52:24,375
It's fine. Just cut it up to here.

737
00:52:29,345 --> 00:52:30,615
Yes, Ms. Park.

738
00:52:32,045 --> 00:52:33,045
What?

739
00:52:33,886 --> 00:52:36,246
What do you mean
the drama might be canceled?

740
00:52:36,815 --> 00:52:37,986
How...

741
00:52:42,486 --> 00:52:45,156
We already did a read-through
and had a test photoshoot.

742
00:52:45,156 --> 00:52:47,025
Why are they canceling it now?

743
00:52:47,025 --> 00:52:48,996
I don't know the details.

744
00:52:48,996 --> 00:52:50,936
The production company
and the TV station...

745
00:52:50,936 --> 00:52:52,295
were negotiating
on the final terms.

746
00:52:52,295 --> 00:52:54,065
And there was a dispute.

747
00:52:54,605 --> 00:52:56,436
This is making me anxious.

748
00:52:58,275 --> 00:52:59,906
- Hello.
- Hello.

749
00:52:59,906 --> 00:53:01,275
Hi.

750
00:53:04,575 --> 00:53:07,186
I'm sorry for asking you
to come all this way.

751
00:53:07,615 --> 00:53:12,386
I thought it was better
to tell you the news in person.

752
00:53:12,386 --> 00:53:15,656
We already did the read-through
and the test photoshoot.

753
00:53:15,656 --> 00:53:17,125
What is this about?

754
00:53:17,125 --> 00:53:19,456
We asked you to come in...

755
00:53:19,926 --> 00:53:22,525
because I have unfortunate news.

756
00:53:22,996 --> 00:53:24,365
It seems like...

757
00:53:24,835 --> 00:53:27,265
this drama will be canceled.

758
00:53:32,976 --> 00:53:34,605
- Pardon?
- I mean,

759
00:53:34,775 --> 00:53:36,805
this is different
from postponing the shoot.

760
00:53:36,805 --> 00:53:39,375
How could you just cancel
a project like this?

761
00:53:39,815 --> 00:53:42,486
We invested all of our time
and energy into this drama.

762
00:53:42,486 --> 00:53:44,285
Right. I'm sorry.

763
00:53:44,285 --> 00:53:46,855
We were negotiating
on the final terms.

764
00:53:46,855 --> 00:53:49,156
When a new management team
took over the company,

765
00:53:49,325 --> 00:53:51,025
the negotiation fell through.

766
00:53:51,025 --> 00:53:54,095
The scale of the drama is quite big
as it is Writer Hwang's drama.

767
00:53:54,095 --> 00:53:56,565
And it was one of the blockbusters
for the year.

768
00:53:56,565 --> 00:53:58,696
But it is the company's decision...

769
00:53:59,265 --> 00:54:01,335
that we cannot proceed
with high-risk factors.

770
00:54:01,565 --> 00:54:04,805
Then, does it mean this drama can
air on a different TV channel?

771
00:54:04,805 --> 00:54:06,506
Well,

772
00:54:06,506 --> 00:54:09,506
the terms of Writer Hwang's contract
are quite complicated.

773
00:54:09,646 --> 00:54:12,875
This drama can only air on HBN.

774
00:54:12,875 --> 00:54:15,015
On top of that,
the current production company...

775
00:54:15,285 --> 00:54:18,186
is facing a lot of trouble...

776
00:54:18,186 --> 00:54:20,216
regarding the crew's wages
of the previous project.

777
00:54:26,325 --> 00:54:27,525
What is this?

778
00:54:30,636 --> 00:54:32,035
What's going on?

779
00:54:36,466 --> 00:54:37,976
Excuse me, Ha Jin.

780
00:54:37,976 --> 00:54:40,946
I heard the production of the drama
will be halted. Is this true?

781
00:54:40,946 --> 00:54:42,305
I heard it's halted because of...

782
00:54:42,305 --> 00:54:45,115
the high appearance fees
of some actors and actresses.

783
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:46,545
Are you one of them, Ha Jin?

784
00:54:46,545 --> 00:54:48,115
She's a victim too.

785
00:54:48,115 --> 00:54:50,956
- Ha Jin, please give us a comment.
- Give us a comment.

786
00:54:57,595 --> 00:55:00,025
Try to comfort her.

787
00:55:00,125 --> 00:55:03,295
She's been pouring
all of her energy into this drama.

788
00:55:03,295 --> 00:55:06,496
Right. I don't know why things are
getting so hard for her.

789
00:55:22,545 --> 00:55:25,615
("Production of 'Hello, Everyone'
Is Halted Due to a Budget Problem")

790
00:55:35,196 --> 00:55:37,335
("Hello, Everyone")

791
00:55:40,666 --> 00:55:42,706
Try again. This time,
pronounce them more clearly.

792
00:55:46,206 --> 00:55:47,605
Now, say your line.

793
00:55:48,045 --> 00:55:50,406
- Korean conglomerates...
- No.

794
00:55:50,545 --> 00:55:52,416
I want you to enunciate
one at a time.

795
00:55:55,416 --> 00:55:57,656
Square your shoulders.

796
00:55:58,386 --> 00:56:00,156
Keep your back straight.

797
00:56:01,156 --> 00:56:02,825
Hello, everyone.

798
00:56:02,825 --> 00:56:04,996
This is the 9 p.m. news.

799
00:57:31,845 --> 00:57:32,875
Ha Jin.

800
00:57:34,015 --> 00:57:35,045
Ha Jin.

801
00:57:39,986 --> 00:57:41,386
Where did she go?

802
00:57:54,166 --> 00:57:57,436
("The Production of Yeo Ha Jin's
'Hello, Everyone' Gets Canceled")

803
00:58:03,206 --> 00:58:04,375
Yes, Ha Kyung.

804
00:58:04,416 --> 00:58:06,446
Anchor Lee, are you with Ha Jin?

805
00:58:07,515 --> 00:58:10,216
No, why? Is something going on?

806
00:58:10,285 --> 00:58:12,615
She's suddenly gone,
and she left her phone at home.

807
00:58:13,256 --> 00:58:14,256
What?

808
00:58:16,156 --> 00:58:17,226
Since when?

809
00:58:18,295 --> 00:58:19,656
Do you know anywhere
she could have gone to?

810
00:59:10,506 --> 00:59:13,045
But I'll stop saying yes so easily
like I did back then.

811
00:59:14,246 --> 00:59:16,585
I want you to be happy.

812
00:59:17,815 --> 00:59:19,515
So I'll stop saying goodbye to you.

813
00:59:36,105 --> 00:59:37,605
Where on earth are you?

814
00:59:55,226 --> 00:59:56,325
Ha Jin.

815
01:00:04,496 --> 01:00:06,065
Where have you been?

816
01:00:07,035 --> 01:00:08,736
I've been worried sick.

817
01:00:09,466 --> 01:00:11,676
At the least,
you should have told Ha Kyung.

818
01:00:15,305 --> 01:00:16,446
Anchor Lee,

819
01:00:17,946 --> 01:00:19,146
don't you hate me?

820
01:00:20,015 --> 01:00:21,345
Why would I hate you?

821
01:00:23,085 --> 01:00:25,615
There is no reason
for me to hate you.

822
01:00:27,585 --> 01:00:28,785
No.

823
01:00:30,956 --> 01:00:32,595
I'm a really bad person.

824
01:00:41,365 --> 01:00:42,406
Ha Jin.

825
01:00:46,875 --> 01:00:50,605
Do you know what I thought about
as I sat here waiting for you?

826
01:00:54,886 --> 01:00:57,345
I'm the one who broke up with you,

827
01:01:06,025 --> 01:01:08,365
but I missed you to death.

828
01:01:13,666 --> 01:01:15,706
I couldn't even breathe...

829
01:01:17,706 --> 01:01:19,706
to think I'll never see you again.

830
01:01:27,986 --> 01:01:30,946
May I just stay by your side?
