<b>Gosh, I never liked that girl.</b>

160
00:17:00,669 --> 00:17:02,830
<b>That sneaky girl.</b>

161
00:17:02,838 --> 00:17:05,145
<b>Gosh, how dare she?</b>

162
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:07,955
<b>No, never.</b>

163
00:17:08,911 --> 00:17:11,640
<b>- What? - I never got in your way.</b>

164
00:17:11,647 --> 00:17:13,225
<b>Not even once.</b>

165
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:17,155
<b>You never made a move on him deliberately,</b>

166
00:17:17,219 --> 00:17:19,780
<b>knowing that I had a crush on him?</b>

167
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:21,295
<b>No, never.</b>

168
00:17:22,258 --> 00:17:24,960
<b>I speculated that you probably liked him,</b>

169
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,535
<b>but I didn't know that Eun Seop was your crush.</b>

170
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:30,075
<b>You know what?</b>

171
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:33,575
<b>I have a crush on someone.</b>

172
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:36,945
<b>I like him so much!</b>

173
00:17:39,275 --> 00:17:40,585
<b>Never.</b>

174
00:17:45,047 --> 00:17:47,825
<b>That's why I can't understand you at all.</b>

175
00:17:48,417 --> 00:17:51,525
<b>Why would you become so mean because of me?</b>

176
00:17:54,356 --> 00:17:55,535
<b>Bo Yeong.</b>

177
00:17:57,126 --> 00:18:00,465
<b>What made you so twisted?</b>

178
00:18:14,877 --> 00:18:16,015
<b>Yes.</b>

179
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:18,485
<b>I found her.</b>

180
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:22,725
<b>No, don't worry. I'll bring her down.</b>

181
00:18:23,285 --> 00:18:24,425
<b>Okay.</b>

182
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,865
<b>Follow me, and don't fall behind.</b>

183
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:09,160
<b>Out of the way.</b>

184
00:19:09,165 --> 00:19:11,475
<b>Move out of the way, everyone!</b>

185
00:19:20,376 --> 00:19:21,515
<b>What?</b>

186
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:23,670
<b>Do you need anything?</b>

187
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:25,540
<b>Just tell me the terms of the deal.</b>

188
00:19:25,548 --> 00:19:28,855
<b>Oh, right. I was supposed to tell you that.</b>

189
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:39,420
<b>What? You don't like it?</b>

190
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:42,090
<b>- No. - Then you don't have to come.</b>

191
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:44,745
<b>Who cares about book clubs anyway?</b>

192
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:49,745
<b>Fine.</b>

193
00:20:17,566 --> 00:20:18,845
<b>You're early.</b>

194
00:20:23,505 --> 00:20:24,815
<b>Thank you.</b>

195
00:20:31,347 --> 00:20:34,825
<b>I hear you're seeing Shim Myeong Yeo these days.</b>

196
00:20:35,517 --> 00:20:36,655
<b>Yes.</b>

197
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:42,195
<b>And she's holed up in the woods somewhere in Gangwon Province?</b>

198
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:50,935
<b>You know, I want you to focus on me...</b>

199
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,405
<b>whether it's as a writer...</b>

200
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:55,375
<b>or as a woman.</b>

201
00:20:56,905 --> 00:20:59,815
<b>- What? - I want you to stop seeing her.</b>

202
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:03,215
<b>I'm not telling you not to publish her book.</b>

203
00:21:03,579 --> 00:21:05,380
<b>Her book will be published...</b>

204
00:21:05,381 --> 00:21:07,385
<b>whether you see her or not.</b>

205
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:09,580
<b>So just publish her book...</b>

206
00:21:09,585 --> 00:21:11,295
<b>without seeing her.</b>

207
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:14,435
<b>Okay? Can you do that?</b>

208
00:21:16,825 --> 00:21:19,035
<b>It's all true, Yun Taek.</b>

209
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:24,300
<b>- Can I get some water, please? - Coming up.</b>

210
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:25,545
<b>What do you mean?</b>

211
00:21:25,934 --> 00:21:28,545
<b>And they say I'm the next Shim Myeong Yeo?</b>

212
00:21:29,238 --> 00:21:30,745
<b>Unbelievable.</b>

213
00:21:30,839 --> 00:21:32,800
<b>What does she have that I don't?</b>

214
00:21:32,808 --> 00:21:35,270
<b>Is my writing not as good as hers?</b>

215
00:21:35,277 --> 00:21:36,570
<b>Am I not as good-looking as she is?</b>

216
00:21:36,578 --> 00:21:39,585
<b>Fine, she was born earlier, I'll give her that.</b>

217
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:42,925
<b>Have you even heard the rumors?</b>

218
00:21:44,353 --> 00:21:45,495
<b>You haven't?</b>

219
00:21:45,788 --> 00:21:47,890
<b>At the peak of her career,</b>

220
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:50,535
<b>she suddenly quit writing and went back to her hometown.</b>

221
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,320
<b>What did they say?</b>

222
00:21:53,329 --> 00:21:55,790
<b>Everything people say about me is true.</b>

223
00:21:55,798 --> 00:21:56,935
<b>Right.</b>

224
00:21:56,999 --> 00:21:58,405
<b>That's the truth.</b>

225
00:22:00,836 --> 00:22:04,485
<b>They say she had a fling with her brother-in-law,</b>

226
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:08,655
<b>and that's why her sister killed her husband.</b>

227
00:22:11,146 --> 00:22:12,685
<b>Believe what they say.</b>

228
00:22:17,486 --> 00:22:19,295
<b>So you didn't know?</b>

229
00:22:19,988 --> 00:22:24,395
<b>Then why did you two break up?</b>

230
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:25,805
<b>Gosh, it's hot.</b>

231
00:22:26,795 --> 00:22:30,275
<b>Excuse me. I asked for water, not broth.</b>

232
00:22:30,366 --> 00:22:31,505
<b>Okay.</b>

233
00:22:31,867 --> 00:22:33,075
<b>Cha Yun Taek.</b>

234
00:22:34,737 --> 00:22:35,875
<b>Cha...</b>

235
00:22:38,173 --> 00:22:39,315
<b>Myeong Yeo!</b>

236
00:22:40,008 --> 00:22:41,145
<b>Myeong Yeo!</b>

237
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:45,385
<b>Answer me.</b>

238
00:22:47,149 --> 00:22:48,595
<b>You're very persistent.</b>

239
00:22:49,518 --> 00:22:51,795
<b>Just tell me the reason.</b>

240
00:22:51,987 --> 00:22:53,325
<b>Is that so hard?</b>

241
00:22:53,856 --> 00:22:54,995
<b>Yun Taek.</b>

242
00:22:57,559 --> 00:22:58,805
<b>Have a good life.</b>

243
00:23:00,596 --> 00:23:02,235
<b>Have a good life.</b>

244
00:23:02,431 --> 00:23:03,630
<b>Get married like you've always wanted,</b>

245
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:04,860
<b>have kids like you've always dreamed of,</b>

246
00:23:04,867 --> 00:23:07,175
<b>and live happily ever after.</b>

247
00:23:08,237 --> 00:23:10,375
<b>Myeong Yeo.</b>

248
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:14,285
<b>Please be happy. Forget an idiot like me, okay?</b>

249
00:23:14,877 --> 00:23:17,585
<b>Myeong Yeo.</b>

250
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:19,085
<b>Let go!</b>

251
00:23:26,422 --> 00:23:28,495
<b>I'm going to do everything with you.</b>

252
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:35,675
<b>I'm going to do everything with you.</b>

253
00:23:41,136 --> 00:23:42,775
<b>Like this.</b>

254
00:24:06,662 --> 00:24:07,805
<b>I'm...</b>

255
00:24:09,164 --> 00:24:10,305
<b>not.</b>

256
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:32,525
<b>Everything people say about me is true.</b>

257
00:24:32,855 --> 00:24:34,225
<b>That's the truth.</b>

258
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:38,305
<b>Believe what they say.</b>

259
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:16,890
<b>- Hae Won. - You woke up?</b>

260
00:26:16,892 --> 00:26:18,035
<b>Yes.</b>

261
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:21,290
<b>Are you feeling okay?</b>

262
00:26:21,296 --> 00:26:22,760
<b>You didn't catch a cold or anything?</b>

263
00:26:22,764 --> 00:26:24,175
<b>No, I didn't.</b>

264
00:26:24,633 --> 00:26:25,875
<b>How are you?</b>

265
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:27,245
<b>I'm good.</b>

266
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:32,015
<b>Did you talk to...</b>

267
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,715
<b>- Did it... - It went well.</b>

268
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:36,185
<b>That's great.</b>

269
00:26:40,515 --> 00:26:44,455
<b>What? Don't tell me you're sleepy again.</b>

270
00:26:44,553 --> 00:26:45,925
<b>I am.</b>

271
00:26:47,623 --> 00:26:50,490
<b>I thought you had insomnia. Or was it mythomania?</b>

272
00:26:50,492 --> 00:26:52,420
<b>- I do. - You have mythomania?</b>

273
00:26:52,427 --> 00:26:54,465
<b>No, I have insomnia.</b>

274
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:00,830
<b>No, you can't fall asleep now. Get up.</b>

275
00:27:00,836 --> 00:27:02,330
<b>- Hae Won. - What?</b>

276
00:27:02,337 --> 00:27:03,700
<b>Let me take a short nap.</b>

277
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:05,100
<b>What short nap?</b>

278
00:27:05,107 --> 00:27:07,200
<b>You slept all this time. Get up already.</b>

279
00:27:07,209 --> 00:27:09,010
<b>I'm bored. Come on.</b>

280
00:27:09,011 --> 00:27:10,215
<b>What?</b>

281
00:27:10,479 --> 00:27:11,655
<b>Hey.</b>

282
00:27:12,748 --> 00:27:13,955
<b>Hey.</b>

283
00:27:15,183 --> 00:27:16,855
<b>- Get up. - What?</b>

284
00:27:17,152 --> 00:27:18,425
<b>My eyes.</b>

285
00:27:19,621 --> 00:27:21,390
<b>Come on, get up.</b>

286
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:24,265
<b>Get up. Come on, get up.</b>

287
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,060
<b>- Hey. - Get up.</b>

288
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:27,260
<b>I'm going to make you into the Joker.</b>

289
00:27:27,262 --> 00:27:29,075
<b>Okay, I'll get up.</b>

290
00:27:30,232 --> 00:27:33,130
<b>Hey, no! Get up.</b>

291
00:27:33,135 --> 00:27:35,100
<b>You're really not going to get up? Come on.</b>

292
00:27:35,103 --> 00:27:36,975
<b>Hey! Get up.</b>

293
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:43,355
<b>Oh, boy.</b>

294
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,240
<b>- Hello, Eun Sil. - What?</b>

295
00:27:46,248 --> 00:27:49,295
<b>- What a very casual entrance. - Wasn't it?</b>

296
00:27:49,351 --> 00:27:52,720
<b>Gosh, our timing is finally right for a change.</b>

297
00:27:52,721 --> 00:27:53,925
<b>I know.</b>

298
00:27:55,657 --> 00:27:57,695
<b>Look at those roses.</b>

299
00:27:59,961 --> 00:28:01,930
<b>Hey. Aren't these...</b>

300
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:04,635
<b>the same ones you gave me a long time ago?</b>

301
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,205
<b>What?</b>

302
00:28:08,336 --> 00:28:09,545
<b>What...</b>

303
00:28:09,971 --> 00:28:12,015
<b>Are you asking me out like this?</b>

304
00:28:12,207 --> 00:28:13,400
<b>Yes.</b>

305
00:28:13,408 --> 00:28:16,310
<b>I'm Lee Jang Woo, the student body president.</b>

306
00:28:16,311 --> 00:28:19,555
<b>- I know that you're Lee Jang Woo. - You know me?</b>

307
00:28:20,182 --> 00:28:21,755
<b>Those roses are white.</b>

308
00:28:21,917 --> 00:28:26,120
<b>You must be very kind and innocent, right?</b>

309
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:27,325
<b>Yes, I am.</b>

310
00:28:27,889 --> 00:28:29,350
<b>But that's too bad.</b>

311
00:28:29,357 --> 00:28:33,565
<b>Baek Gyeong asked me out during lunch earlier today.</b>

312
00:28:33,829 --> 00:28:35,275
<b>And I said yes.</b>

313
00:28:35,497 --> 00:28:36,635
<b>What?</b>

314
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:38,205
<b>Sorry.</b>

315
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:42,415
<b>- I guess our timing didn't match. - Timing?</b>

316
00:28:43,572 --> 00:28:46,515
<b>- What is that? - It's nothing.</b>

317
00:28:46,575 --> 00:28:48,410
<b>- Can I read it? - No, you can't. Why?</b>

318
