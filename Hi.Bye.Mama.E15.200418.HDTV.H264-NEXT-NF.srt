<b>I got you.</b>

160
00:16:38,727 --> 00:16:40,229
<b>You were first in line,</b>

161
00:16:41,021 --> 00:16:43,440
<b>but I was busy sending up
some useless spirits,</b>

162
00:16:45,192 --> 00:16:46,443
<b>so you gained some time.</b>

163
00:16:48,779 --> 00:16:49,780
<b>Hey!</b>

164
00:17:02,209 --> 00:17:03,627
<b>-Who are you?
-What...</b>

165
00:17:03,711 --> 00:17:04,670
<b>Let go of me.</b>

166
00:17:04,753 --> 00:17:06,714
<b>-Let me go.
-Did you just say "useless spirits"?</b>

167
00:17:07,173 --> 00:17:09,216
<b>How dare you call my parents that!</b>

168
00:17:09,967 --> 00:17:12,386
<b>What's this? Why are you
carrying around a cane?</b>

169
00:17:13,012 --> 00:17:15,014
<b>Do you want to get beaten up with this?</b>

170
00:17:15,097 --> 00:17:16,015
<b>Wait. Let me go.</b>

171
00:17:16,098 --> 00:17:17,308
<b>Hey. Wait, sir.</b>

172
00:17:19,059 --> 00:17:20,644
<b>What?</b>

173
00:17:20,728 --> 00:17:22,688
<b>How dare you do this

174
00:17:22,771 --> 00:17:23,606
<b>I...</b>

175
00:17:23,689 --> 00:17:24,565
<b>Wait...</b>

176
00:17:24,648 --> 00:17:25,691
<b>Please.</b>

177
00:18:25,668 --> 00:18:26,877
<b>Excuse me.</b>

178
00:18:28,545 --> 00:18:29,463
<b>What?</b>

179
00:18:30,422 --> 00:18:31,298
<b>Me?</b>

180
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:37,471
<b>I'm sorry about last time.</b>

181
00:18:37,554 --> 00:18:40,432
<b>A shaman was saying something
unbelievable, so I--</b>

182
00:18:40,516 --> 00:18:46,021
<b>No, it's fine. I was talking
without thinking.</b>

183
00:18:46,605 --> 00:18:47,648
<b>But</b>

184
00:18:49,066 --> 00:18:51,610
<b>how long have you known Yu-ri?</b>

185
00:18:51,777 --> 00:18:52,903
<b>She said you were friends.</b>

186
00:18:54,446 --> 00:18:55,572
<b>Yu-ri?</b>

187
00:18:56,448 --> 00:19:00,202
<b>Well, I guess maybe about
five or six years?</b>

188
00:19:00,286 --> 00:19:01,954
<b>-Five or six years?
-Yes.</b>

189
00:19:02,454 --> 00:19:04,373
<b>Then you knew her before the accident.</b>

190
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:08,419
<b>You must know about what happened, then.</b>

191
00:19:08,502 --> 00:19:10,462
<b>Well, yes.</b>

192
00:19:17,553 --> 00:19:22,433
<b>I don't really know
how this happened, though.</b>

193
00:19:26,312 --> 00:19:27,438
<b>Is that so?</b>

194
00:19:28,188 --> 00:19:30,566
<b>Anyway, I'm sorry about yelling
at you last time.</b>

195
00:19:30,649 --> 00:19:33,277
<b>-It's okay.
-Well, then. Bye.</b>

196
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,403
<b>Bye.</b>

197
00:20:41,887 --> 00:20:43,472
<b><i>I already told Min-jeong</i></b>

198
00:20:44,765 --> 00:20:46,475
<b>-that you're Cha Yu-ri.
-What?</b>

199
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:49,395
<b>Why did you tell her?</b>

200
00:20:49,853 --> 00:20:51,105
<b>Why would you do that?</b>

201
00:20:51,188 --> 00:20:54,233
<b>You couldn't tell her you're
Seo-woo's mom and you kept feeling sorry.</b>

202
00:20:54,316 --> 00:20:56,527
<b>And Min-jeong didn't have a clue.</b>

203
00:20:59,571 --> 00:21:01,031
<b>That was painful to watch.</b>

204
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,491
<b>Oh, no.</b>

205
00:21:04,743 --> 00:21:06,120
<b>What do I do?</b>

206
00:21:16,797 --> 00:21:17,881
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

207
00:21:19,258 --> 00:21:21,552
<b>I'm the one who told Gang-hwa.</b>

208
00:21:23,804 --> 00:21:24,847
<b>I guessed.</b>

209
00:21:25,597 --> 00:21:27,474
<b>You're the only one who knew.</b>

210
00:21:34,606 --> 00:21:36,024
<b>What did Gang-hwa say?</b>

211
00:21:43,407 --> 00:21:44,491
<b>He told me to live.</b>

212
00:21:51,373 --> 00:21:53,208
<b>You're thinking the same thing, right?</b>

213
00:21:57,963 --> 00:21:59,006
<b>Oh Min-jeong.</b>

214
00:22:00,507 --> 00:22:01,633
<b>What should I do about her?</b>

215
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,054
<b>No.</b>

216
00:22:06,722 --> 00:22:09,224
<b>This is the right thing.
Saving you comes first.</b>

217
00:22:10,642 --> 00:22:11,935
<b>If you leave again,</b>

218
00:22:13,061 --> 00:22:14,938
<b>Gang-hwa won't be able to live properly.</b>

219
00:22:17,357 --> 00:22:18,358
<b>Right?</b>

220
00:22:19,234 --> 00:22:20,819
<b>He won't just feel guilty.</b>

221
00:22:22,112 --> 00:22:23,572
<b>He won't be able to endure it.</b>

222
00:22:26,492 --> 00:22:27,493
<b>Right.</b>

223
00:22:28,744 --> 00:22:29,953
<b>I'm sure he won't.</b>

224

<b>Yu-ri.</b>

225
00:22:38,462 --> 00:22:40,255
<b>When you told me everything</b>

226
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,800
<b>and said you wouldn't get your place back,</b>

227

<b>do you know how I felt?</b>

228
00:22:52,309 --> 00:22:53,393
<b>"Because you were</b>

231
00:23:07,032 --> 00:23:08,992
<b>That thought broke my heart.</b>

232
00:23:12,663 --> 00:23:14,081
<b>Don't give up because</b>

233

<b><i>If it's not suicide, why did he die?</i></b>

<b>What?</b>

254
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:02,517
<b>He says his best friend killed him</b>

255

<b>and made it look like a suicide

<b>What an asshole!</b>

257
00:27:07,731 --> 00:27:09,149
<b>Then we should catch that person!</b>

258
00:27:09,232 --> 00:27:10,484
<b>And my friend</b>

259
00:27:11,568 --> 00:27:13,153
<b>committed suicide later from the guilt.</b>

260

<b>He says his friend committed suicide

<b>Well...</b>

263

<b>I had the same thought.</b>

318
00:32:53,743 --> 00:32:54,995
<b>-Min-jeong.
-I will</b>

319
00:33:01,543 --> 00:33:02,669
<b>leave you.</b>

320
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:09,301
<b>The hand tremor isn't</b>

321
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,304
<b>why you can't operate.</b>

322
00:33:13,638 --> 00:33:15,724
<b>I knew why,
but I pretended that I didn't know</b>

323
00:33:18,143 --> 00:33:19,227
<b>because I didn't</b>

324
00:33:21,688 --> 00:33:23,356
<b>want to be jealous of a dead woman.</b>

325
00:33:26,651 --> 00:33:28,361
<b>But now, she's not dead anymore.</b>

326
00:33:32,657 --> 00:33:34,492
<b>You were her family, to begin with.</b>

327
00:33:35,368 --> 00:33:36,369
<b>You</b>

328
00:33:36,953 --> 00:33:38,163
<b>and Seo-woo.</b>

329
00:33:39,789 --> 00:33:41,291
<b>You weren't my family.</b>

330
00:33:56,765 --> 00:33:57,932
<b>I am</b>

331
00:34:01,936 --> 00:34:03,438
<b>going to leave you.</b>

332
00:34:23,083 --> 00:34:24,167
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

333
00:35:41,077 --> 00:35:42,454
<b>-Yu-ri.
-Yes.</b>

334
00:35:42,704 --> 00:35:43,538
<b>Mom.</b>

335
00:35:45,665 --> 00:35:47,625
<b>Do you want to go for a walk
around the area?</b>

336
00:35:47,709 --> 00:35:49,002
<b>Yes, I'll join you.</b>

337
00:35:58,470 --> 00:35:59,345
<b>Now,</b>

338
00:36:00,096 --> 00:36:01,764
<b>the weather has gotten warm.</b>

339
00:36:03,099 --> 00:36:05,101
<b>Yes, flowers are blooming, too.</b>

340
00:36:08,313 --> 00:36:09,314
<b>Right.</b>

341
00:36:10,857 --> 00:36:14,444
<b>I should go and see the flowers
with my daughter.</b>

342
00:36:18,907 --> 00:36:19,908
<b>Yu-ri.</b>

343
00:36:21,159 --> 00:36:22,160
<b>Yes?</b>

344
00:36:22,952 --> 00:36:24,120
<b>Aren't you disappointed?</b>

345
00:36:25,455 --> 00:36:26,456
<b>About what?</b>

346
00:36:28,833 --> 00:36:31,085
<b>It has been only five years,</b>

347
00:36:31,878 --> 00:36:33,630
<b>but nothing is yours now.</b>

348
00:36:37,175 --> 00:36:38,301
<b>I have you.</b>

349
00:36:40,428 --> 00:36:43,181
<b>You are mine and will be mine forever.</b>

350
00:36:45,058 --> 00:36:48,520
<b>I had you when I was born,
alive, and dead.</b>

351
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:51,189
<b>You had always been mine.</b>

352
00:36:53,441 --> 00:36:54,442
<b>Right.</b>

353
00:36:56,069 --> 00:36:58,363
<b>And you will be mine forever, too, right?</b>

354
00:37:00,406 --> 00:37:02,951
<b>Should we count your dad and Yeon-ji, too?</b>

355
00:37:03,034 --> 00:37:03,993
<b>Shall we?</b>

356
00:37:11,709 --> 00:37:14,921
<b>Gang-hwa was very sick.</b>

357
00:37:16,923 --> 00:37:18,883
<b>I prayed a lot,</b>

358
00:37:19,634 --> 00:37:21,761
<b>so he could remarry quickly.</b>

359
00:37:24,556 --> 00:37:25,515
<b>Really?</b>

360
00:37:28,851 --> 00:37:31,938
<b>I didn't pray that
for the sake of Gang-hwa or Seo-woo.</b>

361
00:37:33,064 --> 00:37:34,357
<b>But I did it for you.</b>

362
00:37:35,942 --> 00:37:38,736
<b>I thought about how you would feel
if you were watching</b>

363
00:37:39,571 --> 00:37:41,489
<b>and how painful it would be for you.</b>

364
00:37:47,036 --> 00:37:48,079
<b>Well done.</b>

365
00:37:50,915 --> 00:37:52,792
<b>Are you sure that was the right thing?</b>

366
00:37:54,043 --> 00:37:56,170
<b>Yes. You were great.</b>

367
00:37:57,964 --> 00:38:00,341
<b>You're the only one who understands me.</b>

368
00:38:09,350 --> 00:38:10,977
<b>Why don't we sit for a while?</b>

369
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:12,061
<b>Sure, Mom.</b>

370
00:38:21,195 --> 00:38:23,448
<b>I always sit on this bench.</b>

371
00:38:26,409 --> 00:38:30,997
<b>And Gang-hwa's wife usually sits
on the bench over there.</b>

372
00:38:37,962 --> 00:38:40,757
<b>Was it last year or two years ago?</b>

373
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:44,927
<b>Seo-woo was playing out here.</b>

374
00:38:45,386 --> 00:38:48,723
<b>I pretended to be passing by
and sat on this bench.</b>

375
00:39:32,141 --> 00:39:33,726
<b>You'll fall. Be careful.</b>

376
00:39:57,125 --> 00:40:00,086
<b>Seo-woo, do you want to play
in the playground before we go home?</b>

377
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:01,379
<b>Yes.</b>

378
00:40:15,226 --> 00:40:16,936
<b><i>Strangely, ever since that day,</i></b>

379
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:20,481
<b>Seo-woo was always playing
in the playground around that time.</b>

380
00:40:21,649 --> 00:40:24,986
<b>The day after that,
and the day after that.</b>

381
00:40:27,029 --> 00:40:29,866
<b>At first, I just thought
it was a mere coincidence.</b>

382
00:40:31,576 --> 00:40:35,246
<b>Strangely, they only came
whenever I was sitting on this bench.</b>

383
00:40:36,539 --> 00:40:37,540
<b>And</b>

384
00:40:38,624 --> 00:40:43,588
<b>they wouldn't leave the playground
until I left.</b>

385
00:40:47,049 --> 00:40:48,843
<b>And then, I figured out</b>

386
00:40:49,677 --> 00:40:50,678
<b>that</b>

387
00:40:52,096 --> 00:40:54,015
<b>she knew who I was.</b>

388
00:40:55,224 --> 00:40:57,435
<b>She instinctively knew who I was.</b>

389
00:41:01,147 --> 00:41:02,482
<b>You should have asked.</b>

390
00:41:05,276 --> 00:41:09,781
<b>Some relationships are better off
when they are not pursued.</b>

391
00:41:11,616 --> 00:41:13,701
<b>Keeping that boundary was the best.</b>

392
00:41:14,827 --> 00:41:16,287
<b>Someone whom I was grateful for.</b>

393
00:41:17,038 --> 00:41:18,122
<b>That was it.</b>

394
00:41:20,833 --> 00:41:23,795
<b>That way, I wouldn't want more from her.</b>

395
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:06,327
<b>Can you give me a glass of beer?</b>

396
00:42:45,157 --> 00:42:46,200
<b>Right.</b>

397
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:49,036
<b>I</b>

398
00:42:50,955 --> 00:42:52,790
<b>shouldn't come here now, right?</b>

399
00:43:00,673 --> 00:43:01,757
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

400
00:43:02,841 --> 00:43:03,842
<b>Sorry.</b>

401
00:43:24,530 --> 00:43:25,614
<b>Why is everyone</b>

402
00:43:27,741 --> 00:43:28,826
<b>apologizing to me?</b>

403
00:43:30,619 --> 00:43:32,538
<b>Why do you all say you're sorry?</b>

404
00:43:34,790 --> 00:43:36,125
<b>If you keep apologizing,</b>

405
00:43:38,627 --> 00:43:40,170
<b>what am I supposed to do?</b>

406
00:43:42,881 --> 00:43:44,133
<b>What should I do?</b>

407
00:44:11,118 --> 00:44:12,619
<b>Gang-hwa has made up his mind.</b>

408
00:44:14,872 --> 00:44:16,582
<b>Yes, saving Yu-ri comes first.</b>

409
00:44:17,333 --> 00:44:18,417
<b>I would do the same.</b>

410
00:44:19,209 --> 00:44:20,461
<b>I don't think</b>

411
00:44:21,628 --> 00:44:23,339
<b>he told everything to Min-jeong.</b>

412
00:44:23,422 --> 00:44:25,799
<b>Telling her everything
won't do her any good.</b>

413
00:44:25,883 --> 00:44:27,593
<b>That won't change anything, anyway.</b>

414
00:44:28,135 --> 00:44:31,597
<b>It might be better for her to curse
him out and make him the villain.</b>

415
00:44:33,891 --> 00:44:34,933
<b>Right.</b>

416
00:44:36,685 --> 00:44:38,103
<b>My gosh, I don't know anymore.</b>

417
00:44:38,729 --> 00:44:42,358
<b>You startled me. Why did you fling that
to the table without a warning?</b>

418
00:44:42,483 --> 00:44:45,069
<b>What's wrong with you these days?
You get so easily startled.</b>

419
00:44:50,574 --> 00:44:51,408
<b>Hyeon-jeong.</b>

420
00:44:54,870 --> 00:44:56,121
<b>Never mind.</b>

421
00:44:57,331 --> 00:44:59,166
<b>I just have a problem. That's all.</b>

422
00:44:59,249 --> 00:45:00,376
<b>What problem?</b>

423
00:45:01,877 --> 00:45:03,420
<b>Did your followers unfollow you?</b>

424
00:45:04,254 --> 00:45:05,547
<b>Are you serious?</b>

425
00:45:05,964 --> 00:45:07,633
<b>What do you take me for?</b>

426
00:45:08,884 --> 00:45:11,887
<b>I'm going through something crazy
that has never happened</b>

427
00:45:12,679 --> 00:45:13,597
<b>in my life.</b>

428
00:45:13,889 --> 00:45:15,099
<b>Did you know that?</b>

429
00:45:15,182 --> 00:45:16,517
<b>You know nothing.</b>

430
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:17,935
<b>What's the matter with you?</b>

431
00:45:19,603 --> 00:45:20,979
<b>A ghost is following me.</b>

432
00:45:21,063 --> 00:45:22,064
<b>What?</b>

433
00:45:23,482 --> 00:45:25,943
<b>A ghost is following me. I'm scared.</b>

434
00:45:27,152 --> 00:45:29,154
<b>Do you know how scared I am?</b>

435
00:45:31,365 --> 00:45:32,491
<b>Even now,</b>

436
00:45:33,992 --> 00:45:35,661
<b>somewhere in our restaurant,</b>

437
00:45:37,037 --> 00:45:38,997
<b>he might be watching us. I'm scared.</b>

438
00:45:40,207 --> 00:45:41,625
<b>I'm so scared.</b>

439
00:45:44,253 --> 00:45:45,254
<b>Right.</b>

440
00:45:45,796 --> 00:45:47,005
<b>I'll do him that favor.</b>

441
00:45:50,050 --> 00:45:51,427
<b>I'll do it.</b>

442
00:45:52,636 --> 00:45:53,595
<b>Really?</b>

443
00:46:00,602 --> 00:46:03,105
<b>Will you leave me alone
if I do this for you?</b>

444
00:46:03,939 --> 00:46:08,110
<b>If you do this for me,
I'll stop following you. Okay?</b>

445
00:46:08,402 --> 00:46:11,572
<b>Can't you hear me? I'll stop
following you. I'll leave you alone.</b>

446
00:46:11,655 --> 00:46:13,240
<b>You have to keep your promise.</b>

447
00:46:13,824 --> 00:46:15,909
<b>If you don't, I'll call my aunt.</b>

448
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:17,202
<b>My aunt...</b>

449
00:46:17,703 --> 00:46:19,037
<b>What are you doing, Doctor Gye?</b>

450
00:46:20,289 --> 00:46:23,250
<b>-You're alone here.
-Should I call her or my uncle?</b>

451
00:46:23,417 --> 00:46:24,835
<b>It's my mother's birthday next week.</b>

452
00:46:24,918 --> 00:46:27,588
<b>My aunt is not married,

453
00:46:28,088 --> 00:46:30,090
<b>-What is it?
-Please come in.</b>

454
00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:34,344
<b>Hello.</b>

455
00:46:34,845 --> 00:46:35,721
<b>Mom?</b>

456
00:46:40,142 --> 00:46:41,393
<b>Hello.</b>

457
00:46:42,227 --> 00:46:44,313
<b>I'm Kang Sang-bong's mother.</b>

458
00:46:45,439 --> 00:46:47,024
<b>You wanted to see me.</b>

459
00:46:47,608 --> 00:46:48,775
<b>What is this about?</b>

460
00:46:48,859 --> 00:46:49,943
<b>Yes, I did.</b>

461
00:46:52,821 --> 00:46:53,822
<b>Well...</b>

462
00:46:58,452 --> 00:46:59,286
<b>Take a look at this.</b>

463
00:47:00,287 --> 00:47:01,246
<b>What</b>

464
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:03,040
<b>is this?</b>

465
00:47:04,875 --> 00:47:07,336
<b>This is your son's medical record.</b>

466
00:47:08,003 --> 00:47:10,088
<b>I thought you should take a look.</b>

467
00:47:11,882 --> 00:47:12,883
<b>What?</b>

468
00:47:17,179 --> 00:47:20,432
<b>Unlike what you said in your interview,</b>

469
00:47:21,350 --> 00:47:22,893
<b>was he sick?</b>

470
00:47:23,435 --> 00:47:24,520
<b>No.</b>

471
00:47:27,564 --> 00:47:30,192
<b>Ma'am, could you take a look first?</b>

472
00:47:35,489 --> 00:47:36,323
<b>KANG SANG-BONG</b>

473
00:47:36,406 --> 00:47:39,535
<b>HE SINKS HIS HEAD AND TRAILS OFF

00:47:45,791 --> 00:47:46,917
<b>What</b>

476
00:47:49,211 --> 00:47:50,128
<b>is this?</b>

477
00:47:52,923 --> 00:47:55,217
<b>That's Kang Bin's mental state
before he died.</b>

478
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:01,723
<b>Is this true?</b>

479
00:48:05,561 --> 00:48:06,895
<b>He didn't</b>

480
00:48:09,606 --> 00:48:12,693
<b>resent me until his last breath?</b>

481
00:48:16,196 --> 00:48:17,823
<b>That's what I thought.</b>

482
00:48:21,034 --> 00:48:22,035
<b>My mom</b>

483
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:27,416
<b>blames herself that I killed myself

484
00:48:28,417 --> 00:48:31,545
<b><i>I came out to my family

485
00:48:32,546 --> 00:48:34,590
<b><i>It took a lot of courage
for me to tell them,</i></b>

486
00:48:34,673 --> 00:48:36,258
<b><i>but my parents didn't say anything.</i></b>

487
00:48:37,175 --> 00:48:38,260
<b><i>They didn't believe me.</i></b>

488
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:40,887
<b>That can't be true. No.</b>

489
00:48:40,971 --> 00:48:43,515
<b>No. No, my son.</b>

490
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:44,766
<b>That can't be true.</b>

491
00:48:45,559 --> 00:48:49,271
<b>Can you think about this again? Please?</b>

492
00:48:53,817 --> 00:48:55,444
<b><i>I was really disappointed back then.</i></b>

493
00:48:56,862 --> 00:48:58,405
<b><i>It felt as if she denied my existence.</i></b>

494
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:06,872
<b><i>So as soon as I joined the team,
I moved out of the house.</i></b>

495
00:49:07,581 --> 00:49:09,041
<b><i>And I dodged all of their calls.</i></b>

496
00:49:10,959 --> 00:49:12,044
<b><i>I didn't visit them, either.</i></b>

497
00:49:13,462 --> 00:49:15,255
<b>-That's what I did.
-My gosh.</b>

498
00:49:16,548 --> 00:49:18,133
<b>Because I stopped seeing my family,</b>

499
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:21,261
<b>I couldn't call them afterward at all.</b>

500
00:49:23,347 --> 00:49:25,307
<b>When I decided to resolve our issue,</b>

501
00:49:28,352 --> 00:49:29,853

502
00:49:32,022 --> 00:49:33,815
<b>During the session with this doctor,</b>

503
00:49:34,650 --> 00:49:35,817
<b>actually,</b>

504
00:49:36,401 --> 00:49:39,488
<b>I asked him how I could resolve
this issue with my family.</b>

505
00:49:41,448 --> 00:49:43,367
<b>That's why I went to him.</b>

506
00:49:44,368 --> 00:49:48,288
<b><i>And after his session, I gathered up
my courage and decided to visit my family.</i></b>

507
00:49:48,372 --> 00:49:49,956
<b><i>I bought a present for my mom</i></b>

508
00:49:50,832 --> 00:49:52,876
<b><i>-and one for my dad.</i>
-Here you go.</b>

509
00:49:52,959 --> 00:49:54,544
<b><i>-I bought presents for them.</i>
-Thank you.</b>

510
00:49:54,628 --> 00:49:55,754
<b>Bye.</b>

511
00:49:55,837 --> 00:49:58,256
<b><i>But that night, I died.</i></b>

512
00:49:59,925 --> 00:50:01,968
<b>ENDLESS LINE OF VISITORS</b>

513
00:50:02,052 --> 00:50:03,303
<b><i>It was too late.</i></b>

514

<b>YOU'RE THE BEST IN THE WORLD</b>

515

00:50:14,064 --> 00:50:15,649
<b><i>my mom thought I killed myself</i></b>

517
00:50:16,692 --> 00:50:18,527
<b><i>because of what she said back then.</i></b>

518
00:50:18,610 --> 00:50:19,861
<b>I'M SORRY, MY SON</b>

519
00:50:20,821 --> 00:50:22,280
<b>She kept blaming herself.</b>

520
00:50:23,323 --> 00:50:26,159
<b>I can understand that.
That's understandable.</b>

521
00:50:27,452 --> 00:50:28,662
<b>I found out after I died.</b>

522
00:50:30,580 --> 00:50:32,332

523

<b>my mom</b>

<b>wasn't denying my existence.</b>

525
00:50:42,676 --> 00:50:44,511
<b>She just felt sorry for me.</b>

526
00:50:45,387 --> 00:50:47,597
<b>That's why she said that.</b>

527
00:50:50,142 --> 00:50:51,768
<b>She was just so shocked.</b>

528
00:50:56,356 --> 00:50:57,983
<b>I realized that too late.</b>

529
00:51:03,447 --> 00:51:04,531
<b>I wanted to tell</b>

530
00:51:07,367 --> 00:51:09,244
<b>my mom that I don't</b>

<b>Ma'am.</b>

534
00:51:22,966 --> 00:51:25,218
<b>The patient didn't resent
any of his family.</b>

535
00:51:26,011 --> 00:51:27,679

<b>What are you doing?</b>

541

<b>She wriggles her mouth from time to time

<b>It's not that I held onto you.</b>

<b>I couldn't help but hold onto you</b>

<b>But even if</b>

606
00:58:42,655 --> 00:58:44,240
<b>I went back in time,</b>

607
00:58:45,408 --> 00:58:47,035
<b>I still would have saved her.</b>

608

<b>You know who I am, don't you?</b>

609
00:59:57,647 --> 01:00:00,275
<b>I guess you knew instinctively.</b>

01:00:02,068 --> 01:00:05,405
<b>It's not easy to hide one's heart.</b>

611

<b>I knew it.</b>

612
01:00:26,884 --> 01:00:28,970
<b>I thought it was odd. It happened.</b>

613
01:00:30,388 --> 01:00:31,973
<b>I guess he told you.</b>

682

01:07:50,035 --> 01:07:51,120
<b>I can't believe this.</b>

684

<b>That judgment or whatever.

690

697
