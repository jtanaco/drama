<b>Someone got hurt. Please come
quickly.</b>

3
00:01:15,477 --> 00:01:18,510
<b>Sir, I was going to kill
just the passenger as a warning.</b>

4
00:01:18,612 --> 00:01:20,979
<b>But Kim Su Hyuk got hurt instead.</b>

5
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:23,415
<b>- Who is the passenger?
- It's a woman, sir.</b>

6
00:01:23,623 --> 00:01:24,950
<b>He died...</b>

7
00:01:26,525 --> 00:01:27,754
<b>instead of a woman?</b>

8
00:01:42,534 --> 00:01:45,887
<b>We did a CT scan, and there are no
injuries in his head, fortunately.</b>

9
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:48,673
<b>His injury is not bad compared
to the severity of the accident.</b>

10
00:01:48,674 --> 00:01:50,214
<b>I'd say the lord has looked
over her.</b>

11
00:01:50,216 --> 00:01:52,856
<b>When will he be recovering
his senses?</b>

12
00:01:52,864 --> 00:01:54,245
<b>- Are you his family?
- No.</b>

13
00:01:54,247 --> 00:01:56,214
<b>Are you his lover?</b>

14
00:01:56,215 --> 00:01:57,315
<b>No, I'm not.</b>

15
00:01:57,316 --> 00:02:00,356
<b>The person in the passenger seat
gets a serious injury...</b>

16
00:02:00,356 --> 00:02:02,254
<b>or die in most cases like this.</b>

17
00:02:02,255 --> 00:02:05,090
<b>He'd swerved in the direction of
the passenger seat...</b>

18
00:02:05,091 --> 00:02:07,091
<b>knowing that the car would hit
the driver's side.</b>

19
00:02:07,459 --> 00:02:09,995
<b>If you're not a family or a lover,</b>

20
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,935
<b>I wonder what it is that made him...</b>

21
00:02:13,029 --> 00:02:14,230
<b>overcome his instinct to survive.</b>

<b>(Instinct)</b>

23
00:02:49,566 --> 00:02:53,043
<b>This is the first time I'm observing
the funeral of an abandoned dog.</b>

24
00:02:53,045 --> 00:02:55,714
<b>I'm worried because this area is
a redevelopment zone.</b>

25
00:02:55,886 --> 00:02:57,455
<b>They wouldn't demolish
the cathedral, would they?</b>

26
00:02:57,466 --> 00:02:59,384
<b>No one touched a handful of soil
in this place...</b>

27
00:02:59,394 --> 00:03:01,333
<b>for the past 35 years.</b>

28
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:21,953
<b>From now on,</b>

29
00:03:23,098 --> 00:03:25,098
<b>no one will abandon this dog again.</b>

30
00:03:25,965 --> 00:03:27,205
<b>No one.</b>

31
00:03:38,353 --> 00:03:40,550
<b>I brought it because it was hit by
a car.</b>

32
00:03:40,552 --> 00:03:42,821
<b>- It's a puppy.
- What did you say?</b>

33
00:03:44,621 --> 00:03:46,341
<b>Why would you bring the puppy here?</b>

34
00:03:46,343 --> 00:03:49,638
<b>Let's take the puppy to the hospital
right now.</b>

35
00:03:51,129 --> 00:03:54,432
<b>It died not having committed a sin,
like Jesus.</b>

36
00:03:55,112 --> 00:03:57,635
<b>It's going to be born again
after three days.</b>

37
00:03:57,636 --> 00:04:02,073
<b>This dog is not dead, it is dying.</b>

38
00:04:10,749 --> 00:04:11,850
<b>Don't you...</b>

<b>want to save his life?</b>

40
00:04:14,512 --> 00:04:16,855
<b>It would be better
to be born again...</b>

41
00:04:17,085 --> 00:04:20,955
<b>than to die after being abandoned.</b>

you don't believe in the lord.</b>

44

<b>I'll be going now.</b>

45

<b>Wait a minute.</b>

46

<b>I bought this on my way back from

<b>How are you feeling?
Are you all right?</b>

56

<b>Can I ask you why you did that?</b>

57

<b>You almost died.</b>

58

<b>You could've died, trying

<b>Don't be burdened.</b>

60
00:06:09,368 --> 00:06:12,303
<b>I would've done the same thing

<b>- Gosh.
- Let me see it.</b>

62

<b>The accident might've damaged

<b>- I'm fine. Let me just...
- Geez, let me see.</b>

<b>How would you know when you've only

<b>This won't make me give up

<b>No, the truck got in the way

83
00:08:03,807 --> 00:08:08,610
<b>I'm fine,

<b>Yes.</b>

85
00:08:10,525 --> 00:08:12,475
<b>I've got a lecture at the University

<b>Prosecutor Kim?</b>

89

<b>You should be resting. Why would you

91

<b>in that razor-sharp face of yours?</b>

00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,945
<b>The man who did this to you...</b>

94
00:08:51,947 --> 00:08:54,250
<b>turned himself in right after

95
00:08:54,252 --> 00:08:54,984
<b>Turned himself in?</b>

96
00:08:54,986 --> 00:08:58,202
<b>I did some background check

<b>He's a guy who works for Seo Tae Ha.</b>

<b>You know Seo Tae Ha,
the boss of Kennedy clan?</b>

99

<b>The Kennedy clan has close ties with

<b>I also did a background check

<b>I found records of Byun transferring

<b>So where is he now?</b>

103
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:16,168
<b>Seo Tae Ha is currently imprisoned
in Seobu Jail.</b>

104
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:20,344
<b>He must have hit it off
with Byun Sung Hoon there.</b>

105
00:09:20,346 --> 00:09:22,861
<b>Seo Tae Ha might be young...</b>

106
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:24,766
<b>but he integrated...</b>

107

<b>five clans in Suwon, Pyeongtaek,

<b>But if...</b>

110
00:09:31,328 --> 00:09:33,997
<b>Seo Tae Ha is

<b>things are becoming tougher now.</b>

112
00:09:38,435 --> 00:09:40,794

- What if he has a change of heart?</b>

456
00:40:33,626 --> 00:40:36,280
<b>What if he doesn't commit

457
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,482
<b>What if he could live

<b>Get in the car first.</b>

459

<b>Hello, Prosecutor Kim Su Hyuk.</b>

460
00:41:01,490 --> 00:41:03,350
<b>I'm glad you remember my name.</b>

461

<b>But I don't have time to

<b>When did you two meet?</b>

463
00:41:07,063 --> 00:41:09,564
<b>I guess he needs you to fabricate
some evidence.</b>

464
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:11,665
<b>Or...</b>

465
00:41:12,569 --> 00:41:14,404
<b>do you have any personal
business with her?</b>

466
00:41:14,406 --> 00:41:15,912
<b>There's nothing personal.</b>

467
00:41:15,914 --> 00:41:17,237
<b>I do have personal business
with her.</b>

468
00:41:17,426 --> 00:41:19,027
<b>So why don't you leave us?</b>

469
00:41:19,092 --> 00:41:20,861
<b>Can you trust him?</b>

470
00:41:21,490 --> 00:41:25,013
<b>You know he can kill someone with

471
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,195
<b>in a murder case.</b>

472
00:41:27,197 --> 00:41:28,197
<b>What did you say?</b>

473
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:33,155
<b>Hey, my book.</b>

474
00:41:36,159 --> 00:41:37,956
<b>Whether it's official or personal,
I don't think Ms. Sa Bin...</b>

476
00:41:40,329 --> 00:41:42,531
<b>A murder suspect?</b>

477
00:41:49,071 --> 00:41:51,162
<b>Okay, let's talk somewhere else.</b>

478
00:41:52,732 --> 00:41:55,944
<b>It's my business, I'll take care

<b>Hey.</b>

480
00:42:44,242 --> 00:42:46,861
<b>Take my advice

481

<b>I'm a prosecutor. I only deal

482
00:42:51,285 --> 00:42:54,455
<b>I can tell just from their eyes
where they've been,</b>

483
00:42:55,556 --> 00:42:59,374
<b>whether they will stab someone in
the stomach or wear a location tag.</b>

484
00:43:00,092 --> 00:43:02,894

<b>Psychopaths.</b>

<b>Here.</b>

487
00:43:07,519 --> 00:43:10,085
<b>He's rotten up here.
Did you get that?</b>

488
00:43:15,857 --> 00:43:19,160
<b>Why do you judge people and
give them a tag?</b>

489
00:43:21,449 --> 00:43:22,483
<b>I met....</b>

490
00:43:22,663 --> 00:43:24,810
<b>Jong Bum before you did.</b>

491
00:43:25,394 --> 00:43:28,263
<b>So how much do you know about him?</b>

492
00:43:28,343 --> 00:43:30,645
<b>Not much. But...</b>

493
00:43:30,705 --> 00:43:32,240
<b>I will experience him myself.</b>

494
00:43:32,623 --> 00:43:34,759
<b>Whether he's a good person
or a bad person...</b>

495
00:43:34,761 --> 00:43:36,161
<b>I will decide that for myself.</b>

496
00:43:49,483 --> 00:43:50,785
<b>Where do you live?</b>

497
00:43:52,658 --> 00:43:53,525
<b>What?</b>

498
00:43:53,556 --> 00:43:56,303
<b>I don't want to talk to someone
who will defend him. Get out.</b>

499
00:43:58,515 --> 00:44:02,470
<b>Okay, I can't stand the smell
of formalin anyway.</b>

500
00:44:06,858 --> 00:44:08,351
<b>You told me to get out.</b>

501
00:44:08,353 --> 00:44:10,120
<b>I didn't say get out right here.</b>

502
00:44:16,265 --> 00:44:17,765
<b>You have got to be kidding me.</b>

503
00:44:41,543 --> 00:44:42,631
<b>Anger.</b>

504
00:44:43,224 --> 00:44:45,953
<b>But it hurts.</b>

505
00:44:56,716 --> 00:44:58,961
<b>You'll get into another accident

506

<b>Stop thinking about other things

507
00:45:01,366 --> 00:45:02,779
<b>Focus on the road.</b>

508
00:45:04,206 --> 00:45:05,507
<b>I'll get off here.</b>

509
00:45:05,516 --> 00:45:07,852
<b>I need to buy something here.</b>

510
00:45:08,778 --> 00:45:10,049

511
00:45:12,641 --> 00:45:14,843
<b>I'm 32. Why?</b>

512
00:45:15,242 --> 00:45:17,679
<b>You don't seem to be the type

513
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:20,548
<b>I don't care if you want

514
00:45:21,068 --> 00:45:22,851
<b>But what fault did the people
around you make?</b>

515
00:45:25,672 --> 00:45:27,307
<b>It's my life.</b>

516
00:45:47,658 --> 00:45:51,079
<b>Babe! I'm almost there.</b>

517
00:45:51,327 --> 00:45:53,154
<b>You're here to pick me up?</b>

518
00:45:53,154 --> 00:45:55,263
<b>Where would you be?</b>

519
00:46:00,307 --> 00:46:01,552
<b>Mister, stop!</b>

520
00:46:01,755 --> 00:46:05,159
<b>Why are you wandering around drunk

522
00:46:06,671 --> 00:46:10,189
<b>What? Wake up? Who are you

523
00:47:58,303 --> 00:48:02,860

<b>At the prison he was appointed in,</b>

526

<b>The day my mother

<b>Five minutes before my dad heard

<b>The executioner of Ji Chul...</b>

532

<b>Why did it have to be my dad?</b>

533

<b>Gong Ji Chul is dead.</b>

607

<b>Do you want to see me making him

608
00:55:04,397 --> 00:55:06,881
<b>I heard he had gout and arthritis

609
00:55:07,865 --> 00:55:08,827
<b>Never mind.</b>

610
00:55:09,872 --> 00:55:12,915
<b>I can just manipulate the remains

<b>the serial killer

<b>you have the blood of a killer

<b>Sung Hoon.</b>

616

<b>This thread will go...</b>

<b>through your nostrils

618

<b>You've done this.</b>

619

<b>That's right.</b>

622
00:57:09,171 --> 00:57:10,384
<b>Tell me all the seven spots...</b>

626

<b>It was two today,

627

<b>If what you say tomorrow is wrong,</b>

628

<b>you'll get eight
the day after tomorrow.</b>

629
00:57:23,593 --> 00:57:27,295
<b>Why are you doing this to me?</b>

630
00:57:27,546 --> 00:57:29,485
<b>It's because I've got something
I want to protect too.</b>

631
00:57:30,335 --> 00:57:33,978
<b>It'll double every day

<b>Why aren't you answering?</b>

633

<b>You have no one in this jail.</b>

634

<b>Don't forget I hired your lawyer.</b>

635
00:57:58,431 --> 00:58:01,660
<b>I'll tell you everything.</b>

636
00:58:02,147 --> 00:58:05,229
<b>Please save me, Mom.</b>

637
00:58:06,124 --> 00:58:07,411
<b>- Take it down.
- Yes.</b>

638
00:58:07,413 --> 00:58:10,422
<b>I'm scared. Please help me, Mom.</b>

639

<b>Say it.</b>

<b>Let's move the remains.</b>

641
00:59:21,576 --> 00:59:23,429
<b>Geez.</b>

642
00:59:23,505 --> 00:59:25,795
<b>We've dug for half a day, and yet

643
00:59:25,797 --> 00:59:27,582
<b>We got it until the sixth one.</b>

644
00:59:27,851 --> 00:59:30,853
<b>Byun Sung Hoon is playing us.</b>

645

<b>We still have one spot.</b>

646
00:59:38,874 --> 00:59:39,769
<b>Let's move.</b>

647
00:59:49,444 --> 00:59:51,537
<b>What's going on?</b>

648
00:59:51,537 --> 00:59:54,851
<b>Byun Sung Hoon might've thrown
a corpse in this chapel.</b>

649
00:59:54,851 --> 00:59:57,288
<b>What do you mean by that?</b>

650
00:59:57,288 --> 00:59:59,536
<b>That's impossible. This is a church.</b>

651
00:59:59,538 --> 01:00:02,555
<b>Father, a person has died.</b>

652
01:00:04,468 --> 01:00:05,585
<b>Go up and look for it.</b>

653
01:00:09,873 --> 01:00:11,528
<b>Prosecutor.</b>

654
01:00:11,528 --> 01:00:14,131
<b>Byun Sung Hoon cuts his corpse
into pieces and throws them away.</b>

655
01:00:14,133 --> 01:00:17,123
<b>He wouldn't have buried it here
when people are passing by.</b>

656
01:00:17,125 --> 01:00:18,295
<b>We don't know that.</b>

657
01:00:20,568 --> 01:00:22,766
<b>- Over here.
- Let's go.</b>

658
01:00:59,976 --> 01:01:01,195
<b>Here!</b>

659
01:01:01,686 --> 01:01:03,686
<b>- Yes.
- Start digging here.</b>

660
01:02:18,066 --> 01:02:19,766
<b>(Born Again)</b>

661
01:02:19,767 --> 01:02:21,599
<b>Do you think I killed that baby?</b>

662
01:02:21,599 --> 01:02:23,423
<b>Why did you press on the bell
of Lim Hwa Young's neighbor?</b>

663
01:02:23,423 --> 01:02:25,308
<b>Is Gong Ji Chul alive?</b>

664
01:02:25,308 --> 01:02:28,467
<b>Before that,
I think I'm going to find you.</b>

665
01:02:28,468 --> 01:02:31,365
<b>Gong Ji Chul didn't kill
the one he loved.</b>

666
01:02:31,365 --> 01:02:33,412
<b>I wonder who it is
that you want to kill right now.</b>

667
01:02:33,414 --> 01:02:34,782
<b>Don't come any closer.</b>

668
01:02:35,505 --> 01:02:37,580
<b>Why do you get mad at me
and get worried afterward?</b>

669
01:02:37,582 --> 01:02:41,581
<b>The ill fate of the previous lives
will meet to untie their knots.</b>

670
01:02:41,583 --> 01:02:44,732
<b>I sometimes get confused
when I see you, Prosecutor Kim.</b>
