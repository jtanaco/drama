<b>Dr. Lee's here.</b>

00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:13,709
<b>Hello.</b>

3
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:15,379
<b>I must be the last to arrive.</b>

4
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:16,980
<b>I meant to hurry.</b>

5
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:18,119
<b>Jeong Rok.</b>

6
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:21,119
<b>- It's been a while, Gyu Jin.
- Yes.</b>

7
00:00:22,849 --> 00:00:24,320
<b>It's even nicer to see you.</b>

8
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:26,690

9
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,359
<b>Hello, Jeong Rok.</b>

10
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:40,345
<b>I hope it's not a show
that connects...</b>

11
00:00:40,369 --> 00:00:42,369
<b>medical advice

12
00:00:42,439 --> 00:00:44,240
<b>No product placement either.</b>

13
00:00:44,439 --> 00:00:45,515
<b>I hear you.</b>

14
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:48,579
<b>I'll make sure the show
is strictly educational.</b>

15
00:00:49,009 --> 00:00:51,179
<b>- You should...
- I have another question.</b>

16
00:00:52,179 --> 00:00:54,490
<b>Does your face
really look bigger on TV?</b>

17
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:00,359
<b>Gosh, sorry about that.</b>

18
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:02,350
<b>It was just hilarious, that's all.</b>

19
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,600
<b>Na Hee, you haven't changed at all.</b>

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,445
<b>Ready, action!</b>

21
00:01:12,469 --> 00:01:15,146
<b>("QnA with Doctors")</b>

22
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:17,486
<b>A high-end talk show brought
to you with a panel of doctors.</b>

23
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:20,140
<b>This is "QnA with Doctors".</b>

24
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,209
<b>Walnuts are packed
with omega-3 and choline...</b>

25
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:27,689
<b>which helps strengthen
memory function and blood vessels.</b>

26
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:31,896
<b>It's why we can benefit from
eating nuts at an early age.</b>

27
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,566
<b>However, forcing a child
to eat nuts...</b>

28
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:36,129
<b>against his or her will...</b>

29
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:38,506
<b>can add unnecessary stress,</b>

30
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:40,629
<b>and stress can hurt
their brain health.</b>

31
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:43,430
<b>They still need
to consume nuts though...</b>

32
00:01:43,629 --> 00:01:47,275
<b>unless there's a cheaper way
to obtain vitamin E, that is.</b>

33
00:01:47,299 --> 00:01:50,846
<b>Once they're old and find it
necessary to eat them, they will.</b>

34
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:52,109
<b>You should just leave them be.</b>

35
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:59,956
<b>Instead of forcing your children
to eat nuts,</b>

36
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:02,890
<b>talk to them,
and compliment them sincerely.</b>

37
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:05,689
<b>That's a better way
to develop their brain synapses.</b>

38
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,530
<b>There's a study that indicates...</b>

39
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,566
<b>how children with good relationships
with their parents...</b>

40
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:10,689
<b>do better academically.</b>

41
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:14,876
<b>Dr. Song, you must've talked
to your parents a lot as a child...</b>

42
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,675
<b>considering how you became a doctor.</b>

43
00:02:16,699 --> 00:02:19,976
<b>My parents were too busy
frying chicken at the market...</b>

44
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,439
<b>to spend any quality time with me.</b>

45
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:25,639
<b>A pat on the head here and there...</b>

46
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:28,050
<b>and a pat on the back
from time to time.</b>

47
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,349
<b>That's also a way of conversing.</b>

48
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:34,180
<b>I didn't mind the smell
of fried chicken coming from them.</b>

49
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,665
<b>They smelled that way because
they were busy living their lives,</b>

50
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:39,560
<b>and that was all the encouragement
I truly needed.</b>

51
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:43,306
<b>- Good job today.
- Thank you.</b>

52
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,599
<b>- Good job today.
- Thank you for coming.</b>

53
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:51,099
<b>Did you have to undermine
my opinion like that?</b>

54
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:53,469
<b>I was only adding my point of view.</b>

55
00:02:53,699 --> 00:02:56,639
<b>But you're not that way
with the other doctors.</b>

56
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:00,710
<b>Gosh. Good job today.</b>

57
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:03,955
<b>You were trying to make me
look like a fool, weren't you?</b>

58
00:03:03,979 --> 00:03:05,580
<b>That wasn't the case at all.</b>

59
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:09,226
<b>You should think deeper
before answering their questions.</b>

60
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:11,496
<b>You don't want to deceive
viewers with false information.</b>

61
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,096
<b>Deceive viewers?</b>

62
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,605
<b>Don't you know
how knowledgeable I am?</b>

63
00:03:14,629 --> 00:03:17,490
<b>All I'm saying is that...
Why are you rolling your eyes?</b>

64
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:19,575
<b>Good job today, Gyu Jin.</b>

65
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,675
<b>- You too, Na Hee.
- You did well too.</b>

66
00:03:21,699 --> 00:03:24,246
<b>You guys had great chemistry today.</b>

67
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:25,599
<b>Na Hee, you especially...</b>

68
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:27,099
<b>made the show today.</b>

69
00:03:28,069 --> 00:03:29,139
<b>Did you hear that?</b>

70
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,939
<b>Jeong Rok thinks I did well.</b>

71
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:35,580
<b>If you're not busy,
how about we grab a bite?</b>

72
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,479
<b>I'd love to get
a snack or something.</b>

73
00:03:38,949 --> 00:03:41,719
<b>I'm sorry, but I have to get home.</b>

74
00:03:42,949 --> 00:03:44,219
<b>Really?</b>

75
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:46,490
<b>Yes, me too.</b>

76
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,689
<b>Gosh, that was refreshing.</b>

77
00:03:48,789 --> 00:03:51,129
<b>Why couldn't Ga Hee let us go first?</b>

78
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:54,099
<b>Is she worried we'd sell her son
after giving him a bath?</b>

79
00:03:54,229 --> 00:03:56,406
<b>She just never makes
life easy for anyone.</b>

80
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:58,569
<b>And I wouldn't mind you shutting up.</b>

81
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:01,210
<b>I nearly went deaf, you know.</b>

82
00:04:01,569 --> 00:04:02,569
<b>Got it.</b>

83
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:06,409
<b>Gosh, what's taking them so long?</b>

84
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:10,280
<b>Ji Hun, my son!</b>

85
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:12,849
<b>- Unbelievable.
- Guys, we're sorry.</b>

86
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:14,925
<b>We tried to hurry up,</b>

87
00:04:14,949 --> 00:04:17,265
<b>but Ok Ja insisted
on drying her hair longer.</b>

88
00:04:17,289 --> 00:04:19,865
<b>You did too,
so why would you only blame me?</b>

89
00:04:19,889 --> 00:04:22,129
<b>- Let's get going then.
- I can't believe you, Auntie.</b>

90
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:24,759
<b>- This is heavier now.
- Gosh.</b>

91
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:30,370
<b>Joon Seon, did you scrub
Ji Hun's back thoroughly?</b>

92
00:04:30,629 --> 00:04:32,776
<b>Don't tell me you just
poured water on him.</b>

93
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,346
<b>I scrubbed him well...</b>

94
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:36,216
<b>to the point that
his skin almost peeled off.</b>

95
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,956
<b>What about the back of his neck
and his behind?</b>

96
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:39,115
<b>I told you I did.</b>

97
00:04:39,139 --> 00:04:41,156
<b>Just so you know,
I spent too much time on him...</b>

98
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,226
<b>that I didn't have
enough for myself.</b>

99
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:44,026
<b>See? I still need a good scrub.</b>

100
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:45,680
<b>Gosh, that's disgusting.</b>

101
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:48,096
<b>Good job, my son.</b>

102
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,526
<b>I'm the one who did a good job,
not him.</b>

103
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:51,819
<b>Fine. Good job, Joon Seon.</b>

104
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:53,720
<b>Can you hold this for me?</b>

105
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,875
<b>Can't you throw that away?</b>

106
00:05:01,899 --> 00:05:03,946
<b>You've lost most of
the studs on that anyway.</b>

107
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,175
<b>You see,</b>

108
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,639
<b>living with a certain someone
makes you think like him.</b>

109
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:10,586
<b>Why would you drag me into this?</b>

110
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:12,110
<b>I never told you
not to buy hairpins.</b>

111
00:05:12,709 --> 00:05:15,786
<b>I never said it was you, so what's
with the guilty confession?</b>

112
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:16,886
<b>Mom,</b>

113
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:19,326
<b>I better get going
to my part-time job.</b>

114
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:20,795
<b>Sure, go ahead.</b>

115
00:05:20,819 --> 00:05:22,425
<b>Call me if you're scared
to walk home alone.</b>

116
00:05:22,449 --> 00:05:24,249
<b>Sure. I won't be late anyway.
Joon Seon, here.</b>

117
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:25,596
<b>- I'll get going.
- Have a good one.</b>

118
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:26,860
<b>Have a good time.</b>

119
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,235
<b>Look at our youngest sister
working hard.</b>

120
00:05:29,259 --> 00:05:31,329
<b>- Doesn't it make you proud?
- It sure does.</b>

121
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:36,576
<b>A person should always work

122
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,315
<b>like I am doing now.
Don't you agree, Ga Hee?</b>

123
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:40,540
<b>- Those losers.
- Ji Hun, let's go.</b>

124
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:42,709
<b>Gosh, I'm hungry.</b>

125
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:45,180
<b>Unbelievable.</b>

126
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:50,579
<b>I wonder if Na Hee and Gyu Jin
successfully wrapped up the show.</b>

127
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,250
<b>Should I call them?</b>

128
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,550
<b>I'm sure they did well.</b>

129
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:57,396
<b>You sure did raise
a smart one, didn't you?</b>

130
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:59,266
<b>- I mean she's even on TV.
- Tell me about it.</b>

131
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:00,720
<b>I'm more nervous myself.</b>

132
00:06:02,089 --> 00:06:03,360
<b>Yes, Mom.</b>

133
00:06:04,089 --> 00:06:06,235
<b>The show's over and I'm almost home.</b>

134
00:06:06,259 --> 00:06:07,259
<b>Really?</b>

135
00:06:07,529 --> 00:06:10,005
<b>If you're not home yet,
come by with Gyu Jin.</b>

136
00:06:10,029 --> 00:06:11,939
<b>We can order some jjajangmyeon.</b>

137
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,610
<b>We're both a bit tired right now.</b>

138
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:18,185
<b>Right, of course you are.</b>

139
00:06:18,209 --> 00:06:20,980
<b>All right then.
Go home and get some rest.</b>

140
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,649
<b>That reminds me.</b>

141
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:26,319
<b>Can you ask Gyu Jin if he'd

142
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,089
<b>Hold on.</b>

143
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:34,459
<b>Mom wants to know if you'd

<b>Oh, I see. Mom?</b>

145
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:41,906
<b>He says we have
more than enough right now.</b>

146
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:43,646
<b>He'll tell you

147
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:45,915
<b>Okay, I got it.</b>

148
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:48,009
<b>Go home and get some rest then.</b>

149

<b>Don't skip your meals, okay?</b>

150
00:06:50,069 --> 00:06:51,240
<b>Got it.</b>

151
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:58,449
<b>Gosh, that was refreshing.</b>

152
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:02,466
<b>Mom, can we order Chinese?
I'll have a ganjjajang.</b>

153
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:04,759
<b>I'll have a seafood jjamppong.</b>

154
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:07,036
<b>Mom, let's order tangsuyuk too.</b>

155
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,836
<b>Sure, order a big plate.</b>

156
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:11,706
<b>Why would we order in
when we have leftovers?</b>

157
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:13,875
<b>We still have the doenjang jjigae
from this morning.</b>

158
00:07:13,899 --> 00:07:16,370
<b>I'll buy, so let's order Chinese.</b>

159
00:07:17,129 --> 00:07:18,800
<b>If that's the case,</b>

160
00:07:19,699 --> 00:07:20,839
<b>I'll have a ganjjajang.</b>

161
00:07:21,269 --> 00:07:22,685
<b>Let me take your order then.</b>

162
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:24,009
<b>Who wants ganjjajang?</b>

163
00:07:25,009 --> 00:07:26,355
<b>Seafood jjamppong?</b>

164
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:28,185
<b>- Me.
- Got it.</b>

165
00:07:28,209 --> 00:07:29,449
<b>Orders received.</b>

166
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,795
<b>Hello, is this Hong's?</b>

167
00:07:33,819 --> 00:07:35,990
<b>This is President Song Young Dal's.</b>

168
00:07:36,089 --> 00:07:38,536
<b>We'll order 4 ganjjajangs,
2 seafood jjamppongs,</b>

169
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,096
<b>and a big plate of tangsuyuk.</b>

170
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,266
<b>We'd appreciate a fast delivery,
a lot of pickled radishes,</b>

171
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:43,930
<b>and a free plate of fried dumplings.</b>

172
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,500
<b>Wait, what was that sound?</b>

173
00:07:49,029 --> 00:07:50,769
<b>Didn't it come from above?</b>

174
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,745
<b>A stray cat must've gotten inside.</b>

175
00:07:52,769 --> 00:07:55,045
<b>No, Dad, hold on.
Let me go up there.</b>

176
00:07:55,069 --> 00:07:58,209
<b>It's not like there's
anything to eat up there.</b>

177
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,040
<b>Gosh.</b>

178
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:08,319
<b>See? I can do a push-up
on my thumbs, right?</b>

179
00:08:08,449 --> 00:08:11,295
<b>You can't.
I just saw you miserably fail.</b>

180
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:13,266
<b>Also, I saw you
make fists with your hands.</b>

181
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:16,165
<b>You're wrong.
I was balancing on my thumbs.</b>

182
00:08:16,189 --> 00:08:17,459
<b>- No way.
- You two!</b>

183
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,500
<b>Have you forgotten what I told you?
You're supposed to be like ghosts.</b>

184
00:08:22,529 --> 00:08:24,305
<b>No one can know you're up here.</b>

185
00:08:24,329 --> 00:08:27,516
<b>It's his fault for insisting
that a rookie like him...</b>

186
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,716
<b>can do a push-up on his thumbs.</b>

187
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:31,555
<b>I wasn't insisting.
Didn't I just prove it to you?</b>

188
00:08:31,579 --> 00:08:35,226
<b>Shut it, you two, and listen up.</b>

189
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:37,625
<b>My parents eat
home-cooked meals every day,</b>

190
00:08:37,649 --> 00:08:39,156
<b>work consistent hours,</b>

191
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:41,395
<b>and take dance classes
at the market.</b>

192
00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:42,649
<b>Do you know what that means?</b>

193
00:08:43,649 --> 00:08:45,590
<b>It means that
they're healthier than us.</b>

194
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:48,235
<b>Everything including their sense
of sight, hearing, and smell...</b>

195
00:08:48,259 --> 00:08:49,960
<b>are quite sensitive,</b>

196
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:53,429
<b>so keep it down as much as you can
or you'll be back at the sauna.</b>

197
00:08:54,529 --> 00:08:55,669
<b>We're sorry.</b>

198
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:58,100
<b>We thought you were
still at the sauna.</b>

199
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,570
<b>So, are you two feeling better now?</b>

200
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,340
<b>Yes, we're in better condition.</b>

201
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,556
<b>I'm loving the warm floors...</b>

202
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:08,149
<b>and the fact that it's not damp.</b>

203
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:09,450
<b>I'm glad then.</b>

204
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:11,210
<b>Here you go.</b>

205
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,720
<b>Hold on a second.</b>

206
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:22,765
<b>Hello, sir.
This is President Song's again.</b>

207
00:09:22,789 --> 00:09:24,469
<b>Our food hasn't been
delivered yet, has it?</b>

208
00:09:24,659 --> 00:09:27,700
<b>Then I'll order two large portions
of jajangmyeon.</b>

209
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:29,730
<b>Can you deliver it
to the rooftop apartment...</b>

210
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:31,070
<b>using the outside stairs?</b>

211
00:09:31,539 --> 00:09:34,139
<b>Yes, please keep it a secret.</b>

212
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,509
<b>Don't forget
the free fried dumplings.</b>

213
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:43,509
<b>- Welcome.
- Hello.</b>

214
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:47,056
<b>This is pretty. Mom would love it.</b>

215
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,096
<b>- How much is this?
- Six dollars.</b>

216
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,789
<b>- I'll take it.
- Sure.</b>

217
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:55,460
<b>Do you perhaps have one more
of the same design?</b>

218
00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:01,929
<b>- The person you have reached...
- They just never answer me.</b>

219
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:04,100
<b>The show must be over by now.</b>

220
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,940
<b>- It's me, Ms. Choi.
- Hi, there.</b>

221
00:10:10,769 --> 00:10:13,216
<b>Goodness. Your hair is wet.</b>

222
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,426
<b>You can catch a cold
if you don't dry this, you know.</b>

223
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:17,985
<b>My entire family
went to the sauna today.</b>

224
00:10:18,009 --> 00:10:20,820
<b>Your whole family?</b>

225
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,549
<b>Isn't that what families
used to do 50 years ago?</b>

226
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:24,995
<b>The whole family goes
sometimes on the weekends.</b>

227
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:26,035
<b>Meanwhile, my mom and aunt...</b>

228
00:10:26,059 --> 00:10:28,429
<b>always go to get rid of
the stench of fried oil.</b>

229
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:29,730
<b>I see.</b>

230
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,799
<b>This is for you.</b>

231
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:35,629
<b>What's this?</b>

232
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:38,576
<b>You grilled me that steak
the other day, remember?</b>

233
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,509
<b>It's nothing expensive though.
I just bought it on the street.</b>

234
00:10:41,769 --> 00:10:43,309
<b>Is it a gift?</b>

235
00:10:44,309 --> 00:10:46,309
<b>Gosh, it's pretty.</b>

236
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:50,509
<b>Maybe it's because
I have such an elegant look.</b>

237
00:10:50,779 --> 00:10:52,495
<b>It must be because you look lovely.</b>

238
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:54,620
<b>It's like one
from a department store.</b>

239
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,360
<b>I'm only kidding.
Anyway, thank you so much.</b>

240
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:03,929
<b>So this is what it's like
to raise a daughter.</b>

241
00:11:05,129 --> 00:11:07,576
<b>Well, I'll take my break now.
Good luck down here.</b>

242
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,529
<b>Sure, go ahead.</b>

243
00:11:16,169 --> 00:11:17,785
<b>Welcome.</b>

244
00:11:17,809 --> 00:11:19,255
<b>Is there a seat with a plug here?</b>

245
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,909
<b>Yes, over there.</b>

246
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:23,649
<b>So what can I get you?</b>

247
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:26,779
<b>My mom is the lady
with the long hair!</b>

248
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:31,596
<b>My mom's hair is so long
that it drags on the ground.</b>

249
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:33,289
<b>Her hair...</b>

250
00:11:34,659 --> 00:11:36,436
<b>- is over 2m long...
- Excuse me.</b>

251
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:38,399
<b>- Yes?
- Can I get a glass of cold water?</b>

252
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:40,129
<b>Well, it's self-served...</b>

253
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:42,476
<b>- Her hair...
- Sure thing.</b>

254
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,806
<b>For 23 years...</b>

255
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:45,799
<b>I told you
I have an operation tomorrow.</b>

256
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:50,169
<b>Well, don't drink so much.
We'll talk again soon.</b>

257
00:11:53,909 --> 00:11:56,750
<b>Is she working part-time
on the weekends too?</b>

258
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:01,789
<b>Here you go. My gosh!</b>

259
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:03,125
<b>- Are you all right?
- Seriously?</b>

260
00:12:03,149 --> 00:12:04,566
<b>- Are you all right?
- Unbelievable.</b>

261
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:05,820
<b>Move it!</b>

262
00:12:06,019 --> 00:12:08,960
<b>Who serves water like that?
You should've come from the front.</b>

263
00:12:09,289 --> 00:12:11,166
<b>How can I see you
if you come from the side?</b>

264
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:12,799
<b>I don't have eyes
on the side of my face.</b>

265
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:16,200
<b>I'm terribly sorry.
I didn't think of that.</b>

266
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:18,100
<b>So what are you
going to do about this?</b>

267
00:12:18,169 --> 00:12:19,840
<b>Do you know how expensive this is?</b>

268
00:12:20,169 --> 00:12:22,885
<b>Suede should never
be drenched in water.</b>

269
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:24,769
<b>Are you kidding me?</b>

270
00:12:25,379 --> 00:12:27,379
<b>Whatever. You'll just have
to get me a new one.</b>

271
00:12:27,809 --> 00:12:28,786
<b>What?</b>

272
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:31,620
<b>This is your mistake, so of course.</b>

273
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:33,950
<b>It's already losing its color.</b>

274
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:35,419
<b>Hold on a second.</b>

275
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,735
<b>This looks like a fake to me.</b>

276
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,806
<b>Real suede wouldn't
lose color like this.</b>

277
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:43,265
<b>Who are you to butt in like this?</b>

278
00:12:43,289 --> 00:12:44,360
<b>Mr. Yoon...</b>

279
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:48,076
<b>I'm someone who can represent
the owner of this cafe.</b>

280
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,046
<b>From what I saw,</b>

281
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:52,370
<b>you're the one who
knocked over the cup.</b>

282
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:54,275
<b>So why must she take responsibility?</b>

283
00:12:54,299 --> 00:12:55,515
<b>That's absurd!</b>

284
00:12:55,539 --> 00:12:56,639
<b>Unbelievable.</b>

285
00:12:57,470 --> 00:13:00,179
<b>You have a bad memory
for someone your age.</b>

286
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,879
<b>Let's check
the security camera then.</b>

287
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:05,056
<b>If you really did
knock over the cup,</b>

288
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,096
<b>you'll have to pay
for the dry cleaning...</b>

289
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,350
<b>and compensate her
for emotional injury.</b>

290
00:13:09,649 --> 00:13:12,666
<b>It's not like I caused her any harm.</b>

291
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:15,289
<b>You tried to blame
an innocent person just now.</b>

292
00:13:15,429 --> 00:13:17,659
<b>I heard you yell
and shoot impolite comments.</b>

293
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:20,806
<b>Look at how pale your skin is.</b>

294
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:22,076
<b>You must be in shock.</b>

295
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,899
<b>What? That's right.</b>

296
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:26,370
<b>I can't believe you people.</b>

297
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,169
<b>Whatever. Just forget about it.</b>

298
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:32,080
<b>We won't see you out.
Have a good day.</b>

299
00:13:33,409 --> 00:13:35,950
<b>I'm sorry, ma'am. Take care.</b>

300
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,149
<b>Ms. Song,</b>

301
00:13:42,389 --> 00:13:44,625
<b>are you too nice or foolishly naive?</b>

<b>The kimbap was just terrible.</b>

462

<b>It's unbelievable.</b>

463
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,755
<b>But the owner didn't seem to agree.</b>

464
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:02,886
<b>She says it tastes just right.</b>

465
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:03,956
<b>Really?</b>

466
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:05,795
<b>Is it that bad?</b>

467
00:23:05,819 --> 00:23:07,595
<b>Yes. It does taste bad.</b>

<b>Really?</b>

479
00:23:29,769 --> 00:23:32,956
<b>I wonder whose idea it was.</b>

480
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:34,440
<b>There you go again.</b>

481
00:23:34,509 --> 00:23:36,926
<b>You just demean yourself

482
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:39,150
<b>You look quite stoic though.</b>

483
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:42,966
<b>Look who's talking.
You just never stop talking.</b>

<b>Sure. I asked him to do it.</b>

525
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:39,700

<b>Thank you

<b>my husband is abroad.</b>

535
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:46,960
<b>He will come back soon,</b>

536
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,700

537

<b>There are things

538

<b>I understand.</b>

539
00:27:56,369 --> 00:27:58,740
<b>I had no idea.</b>

540
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:00,380
<b>Yes.</b>

541
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:04,555
<b>Tell me whenever
something like this comes up.</b>

542
00:28:04,579 --> 00:28:05,950
<b>I can do this much.</b>

543
00:28:06,549 --> 00:28:09,226
<b>No way.
That would be insulting to Dr. Song.</b>

544
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:11,890
<b>It's okay. This is nothing.</b>

545

<b>Right?</b>

546
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,386
<b>I put up the closed sign.</b>

553
00:28:47,890 --> 00:28:49,835
<b>What? Okay, you do that.</b>

554
00:28:49,859 --> 00:28:51,936
<b>I'll drop by
the association's office.</b>

555
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,505
<b>I have to update

556
00:28:53,529 --> 00:28:55,206
<b>Okay, then. Let's all split up.</b>

557
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:57,369
<b>We need days like this too.
This is great.</b>

<b>My gosh. My poor shoulder.</b>

559
00:29:00,539 --> 00:29:02,240
<b>Yes, of course.</b>

560
00:29:02,609 --> 00:29:04,845
<b>I mixed three-and-a-half vats
of batter.</b>

561
00:29:04,869 --> 00:29:06,210
<b>No wonder it hurts.</b>

562
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:13,019
<b>Still, I wish we got more sales,
even if my arm falls off.</b>

563
00:29:14,019 --> 00:29:18,065
<b>I'll make lots of money
and invest in my son's business.</b>

564
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:20,259
<b>I'll buy Ga Hee a home,</b>

565
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:23,690
<b>and send my youngest abroad
to study a foreign language.</b>

566

567
00:29:26,329 --> 00:29:29,376

568
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,069
<b>How lovely. Let me see.</b>

569
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:35,500
<b>Oh, they smell great too.</b>

570
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:38,686
<b>You're wearing the pin too.</b>

571

572
00:29:41,309 --> 00:29:43,609
<b>It suits you so well too.</b>

573
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:45,809
<b>Of course it does.</b>

574
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:50,095
<b>The kids.
How do you think the shoot went?</b>

575
00:29:50,119 --> 00:29:52,025
<b>I can't believe they'll be on TV.</b>

576

<b>Hey.</b>

577
00:29:54,619 --> 00:29:57,390
<b>I'm a bit busy. Bye.</b>

578
00:30:01,529 --> 00:30:04,869
<b>My goodness.
What got her in a bad mood now?</b>

579
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:08,440
<b>She just has two extremes.
I can't stand her.</b>

580
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:13,680
<b>I think your biggest problem
is your attitude.</b>

581
00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:15,680
<b>You act like
you're beneath everyone.</b>

582
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:19,495
<b>You have a submissive attitude
that makes everyone think...</b>

583
00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:22,380
<b>there's nothing wrong with
making excessive demands.</b>

584
00:30:22,849 --> 00:30:24,789
<b>You act submissive.</b>

585
00:30:24,819 --> 00:30:27,495
<b>This is the biggest problem.
Do you get what I mean?</b>

586
00:30:27,519 --> 00:30:29,436
<b>Yes. Submissive attitude.</b>

587
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:31,866
<b>You don't have to write it down.
Just change how you act.</b>

588
00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:33,505
<b>Okay, how I act.</b>

589
00:30:33,529 --> 00:30:36,146
<b>If we go into detail,
your attitude is expressed by...</b>

590
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:40,075
<b>the look in your eyes
and the tone of your voice.</b>

591
00:30:40,099 --> 00:30:41,200
<b>First.</b>

592
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:45,470
<b>The look in your eyes.
You need a strong gaze.</b>

593
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:48,255
<b>If your gaze wavers
or you act unsure,</b>

594
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:50,309
<b>the other person is bound to
look down on you.</b>

595
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:51,950
<b>Now,</b>

596
00:30:53,349 --> 00:30:54,380
<b>glare at me.</b>

597
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:01,920
<b>Glare. Ms. Song. Harder.</b>

598
00:31:02,619 --> 00:31:04,930
<b>As if you want to crush me.</b>

599
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:07,035
<b>That's it. Yes, not bad.</b>

600
00:31:07,059 --> 00:31:09,160
<b>More, more. More.</b>

601
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:12,470
<b>More, more. Well done.</b>

602
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:13,815
<b>That was great.</b>

603
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:16,970
<b>Don't forget that tip.
You can stop glaring now.</b>

604
00:31:17,109 --> 00:31:19,140
<b>The second part is
about how you speak.</b>

605
00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:21,180
<b>You must always be firm.</b>

606
00:31:21,539 --> 00:31:25,279
<b>If you don't sound like you mean it,
you will lose every argument.</b>

<b>Okay.</b>

760
00:39:34,569 --> 00:39:36,539
<b>I'll first upload them onto...</b>

761
00:39:36,599 --> 00:39:38,159
<b>the second-hand
designer outlet website.</b>

762
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:41,950
<b>How much should I ask for them?</b>

763
00:39:43,539 --> 00:39:45,539
<b>Normally, I'd ask for more
than its original price.</b>

764
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:48,009
<b>Since I'm urgent though...</b>

765
00:39:48,310 --> 00:39:51,649
<b>(Second-hand Designer Outlet,
Price: 3,000 dollars)</b>

766
00:40:02,730 --> 00:40:03,899
<b>Ok Ja, you're here.</b>

767
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:06,500
<b>You're here early today.</b>

768
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:10,569
<b>That's odd.</b>

769
00:40:10,870 --> 00:40:12,386
<b>What do you mean?</b>

770
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,139
<b>Before I went home yesterday,</b>

771
00:40:15,569 --> 00:40:19,449
<b>I neatly sorted out the chairs.</b>

772
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:23,050
<b>They're a mess right now though
and a used cup is out here.</b>

773
00:40:23,149 --> 00:40:25,326
<b>You probably didn't
clean up properly.</b>

774
00:40:25,350 --> 00:40:27,026
<b>It's not like
those chairs have feet.</b>

775
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:28,826
<b>That's not it.</b>

776
00:40:28,850 --> 00:40:30,865
<b>I'm sure of it, you know.</b>

777
00:40:30,889 --> 00:40:33,206
<b>I stacked the chairs properly,</b>

778
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:35,336
<b>cleaned the surface,
turned off the light,</b>

779
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,476
<b>and then went home.</b>

780
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:39,146
<b>You know how I remember
even the frivolous details.</b>

781
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:42,800
<b>No theft was committed, okay?
Not that there's anything to take.</b>

782
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:46,586
<b>Good morning, everyone. Morning.</b>

783
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:48,745
<b>What brings you to work so early?</b>

784
00:40:48,769 --> 00:40:50,255
<b>Don't you get here around noon?</b>

785
00:40:50,279 --> 00:40:53,485
<b>I was bored, that's all.
I'll sort out the storefront first.</b>

786
00:40:53,509 --> 00:40:54,649
<b>Sure thing.</b>

787
00:40:55,350 --> 00:40:57,449
<b>How diligent of him.</b>

788
00:40:57,980 --> 00:41:02,026
<b>I doubt many young people his age
find their own work to do...</b>

789
00:41:02,050 --> 00:41:03,490
<b>like our Hyo Sin does.</b>

790
00:41:04,290 --> 00:41:08,060
<b>It's uncanny how he's my type
from head to toe.</b>

791
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:11,636
<b>Didn't you say your dream guy
was Park Bo Gum?</b>

792
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:13,829
<b>It's as if every man is your type.</b>

793
00:41:14,129 --> 00:41:15,529
<b>Actually, that's not true.</b>

794
00:41:15,629 --> 00:41:18,040
<b>Someone like Yang Chi Su
is definitely not my type.</b>

795
00:41:18,139 --> 00:41:20,615
<b>Don't be like that.
Hate can easily turn into love.</b>

796
00:41:20,639 --> 00:41:22,915
<b>Young Dal, I'd rather
you throw profanities my way.</b>

797
00:41:22,939 --> 00:41:25,315
<b>How could you say
such an evil thing?</b>

798
00:41:25,339 --> 00:41:26,985
<b>How is that a curse?</b>

799
00:41:27,009 --> 00:41:29,480
<b>Mr. Yang is a decent man, you know.</b>

800
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,795
<b>Unlike someone I know,
he's affectionate...</b>

801
00:41:31,819 --> 00:41:34,589
<b>and spends money when he needs to.</b>

802
00:41:37,490 --> 00:41:38,935
<b>Didn't it say it was going to rain?</b>

803
00:41:38,959 --> 00:41:41,389
<b>I guess I brought my umbrella
for nothing.</b>

804
00:41:47,829 --> 00:41:49,315
<b>- Jeong Bong.
- Yes?</b>

805
00:41:49,339 --> 00:41:50,600
<b>Focus!</b>

806
00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:52,485
<b>How can you hold your ground
when someone comes at you...</b>

807
00:41:52,509 --> 00:41:54,139
<b>if you let a sandbag push you back?</b>

808
00:41:54,310 --> 00:41:55,886
<b>Plant your feet on the ground...</b>

809
00:41:55,910 --> 00:41:57,855
<b>and absorb the force.</b>

810
00:41:57,879 --> 00:41:59,226
<b>- Got it.
- Again.</b>

811
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:00,310
<b>Sure thing.</b>

812
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,689
<b>What's wrong with you two?</b>

813
00:42:12,019 --> 00:42:13,735
<b>Are you still not feeling well?</b>

814
00:42:13,759 --> 00:42:15,305
<b>We're not exactly
back to full strength.</b>

815
00:42:15,329 --> 00:42:16,329
<b>Joon Seon,</b>

816
00:42:16,629 --> 00:42:18,060
<b>I thought we were fine,</b>

817
00:42:18,430 --> 00:42:21,000
<b>but we've been lacking strength
in our legs.</b>

818
00:42:22,839 --> 00:42:26,069
<b>I guess you're not ready
to go back to training.</b>

819
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:28,716
<b>Taking too much time off
will be worse though.</b>

820
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:30,956
<b>Still, your health comes first.</b>

821
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:33,949
<b>You won't be able to train anyway
if you hurt yourselves.</b>

822
00:42:35,350 --> 00:42:37,920
<b>Let's get a bowl of seolleongtang
and go home...</b>

823
00:42:37,949 --> 00:42:40,326
<b>to review the movie we filmed.
That sounds better.</b>

824
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:42,420
<b>- Seolleongtang?
- It's okay.</b>

825
00:42:42,689 --> 00:42:44,189
<b>We don't deserve
something as fancy.</b>

826
00:42:44,589 --> 00:42:46,660
<b>Seolleongtang-flavored cup noodles
will do.</b>

827
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:48,259
<b>Don't be ridiculous.</b>

828
00:42:48,459 --> 00:42:50,399
<b>I may not be much of a boss,</b>

829
00:42:50,430 --> 00:42:51,930
<b>but I can still
buy you seolleongtang.</b>

830
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:55,170
<b>You can have two bowls each today.</b>

831
00:42:55,899 --> 00:42:57,639
<b>- Let's go.
- Two bowls?</b>

832
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:00,269
<b>It's all right.</b>

833
00:43:00,439 --> 00:43:01,839
<b>One bowl is fine enough.</b>

834
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:04,240
<b>Yes, I'm on my way.</b>

835
00:43:05,610 --> 00:43:08,579
<b>Of course, it's the real deal.
You'll know once you see it.</b>

836
00:43:09,879 --> 00:43:12,920
<b>Sure. I'll see you soon. Got it.</b>

837
00:43:14,649 --> 00:43:16,319
<b>Suspicious cow.</b>

838
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:22,899
<b>I didn't know I'd be parting ways
with you so soon.</b>

839
00:43:23,930 --> 00:43:25,800
<b>I hope your new owner cherishes you.</b>

840
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,069
<b>Hold on.</b>

841
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:39,110
<b>It's you, right?</b>

842
00:43:39,579 --> 00:43:42,110
<b>Don't you remember me?
I'm Mr. Song's eldest daughter.</b>

843
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:47,350
<b>I see that we haven't
introduced ourselves yet.</b>

844
00:43:47,490 --> 00:43:49,920
<b>I'm Song Ga Hee,
a divorcee of three years.</b>

845
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:51,759
<b>I see.</b>

846
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:56,160
<b>What I said is at least worth
a name out of you.</b>

847
00:43:56,930 --> 00:43:57,959
<b>Don't you have one?</b>

848
00:43:58,230 --> 00:43:59,430
<b>It's Park Hyo Sin.</b>

849
00:43:59,529 --> 00:44:00,769
<b>Park Hyo Sin?</b>

850
00:44:01,169 --> 00:44:02,740
<b>Like the singer?</b>

851
00:44:03,639 --> 00:44:04,816
<b>How old are you?</b>

852
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:06,940
<b>No, wait. Let me guess.</b>

853
00:44:07,870 --> 00:44:09,610
<b>Mid-20s?</b>

854
00:44:09,679 --> 00:44:12,115
<b>No, late-20s!</b>

855
00:44:12,139 --> 00:44:13,186
<b>Yes.</b>

856
00:44:13,210 --> 00:44:14,379
<b>I knew it.</b>

857
00:44:15,779 --> 00:44:18,149
<b>Is it your first time
making food deliveries?</b>

858
00:44:18,179 --> 00:44:19,850
<b>You don't seem comfortable
on the bike.</b>

859
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:21,889
<b>That's right.</b>

860
00:44:23,389 --> 00:44:24,690
<b>Am I annoying you?</b>

861
00:44:25,090 --> 00:44:26,759
<b>Should I stop talking?</b>

862
00:44:27,090 --> 00:44:28,530
<b>I still have
more deliveries to make.</b>

863
00:44:28,590 --> 00:44:31,000
<b>Deliver them yourself
and I'll be glad to talk.</b>

864
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,280
<b>That's not the case, right?</b>

865
00:44:39,769 --> 00:44:41,340
<b>Prickly jerk.</b>

866
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:43,039
<b>Young but prickly.</b>

867
00:44:43,879 --> 00:44:45,580
<b>You get a pass
because you're handsome!</b>

868
00:44:48,379 --> 00:44:49,620
<b>She's calling again?</b>

869
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:51,750
<b>Yes, what's up?</b>

870
00:44:52,019 --> 00:44:53,320
<b>I'm still on my way...</b>

871
00:44:54,750 --> 00:44:57,190
<b>How can I lower the price
another 100 dollars?</b>

872
00:44:57,860 --> 00:45:00,129
<b>You can buy that one instead then.</b>

873
00:45:01,029 --> 00:45:02,730
<b>Whatever. I'm not selling!</b>

874
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:06,299
<b>She's an outright thief.</b>

875
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:08,700
<b>Selling this bag is already
breaking my heart enough.</b>

876
00:45:09,899 --> 00:45:11,740
<b>Darn it.</b>

877
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:16,539
<b>Guys, come downstairs.
No one's home.</b>

878
00:45:18,909 --> 00:45:20,686
<b>- No one's home?
- Really?</b>

879
00:45:20,710 --> 00:45:22,450
<b>Everyone must be out.</b>

880
00:45:22,580 --> 00:45:25,549
<b>Anyway, it's better to watch a movie
on a bigger screen, right?</b>

881
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:32,966
<b>Look. There I am.</b>

882
00:45:32,990 --> 00:45:34,235
<b>- Where?
- It's over.</b>

883
00:45:34,259 --> 00:45:36,029
<b>There I am. That's me.</b>

884
00:45:36,230 --> 00:45:38,299
<b>- The guy in red?
- No, the one next to him.</b>

885
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:39,799
<b>It's over.</b>

886
00:45:40,899 --> 00:45:43,070
<b>Hey, I told you.</b>

887
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:45,100
<b>You have to stall
as long as you can.</b>

888
00:45:45,139 --> 00:45:47,870
<b>At least your acquaintances
should recognize you.</b>

889
00:45:47,970 --> 00:45:48,970
<b>Watch.</b>

890
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:54,025
<b>When you fall down,
you shouldn't look like this.</b>

891
00:45:54,049 --> 00:45:57,525
<b>Turn your head toward the camera
a little like this.</b>

892
00:45:57,549 --> 00:46:00,395
<b>If you turn it too much,
the director won't like it.</b>

893
00:46:00,419 --> 00:46:04,135
<b>Just turn it a little
at a 35-degree angle.</b>

894
00:46:04,159 --> 00:46:05,360
<b>Do you know what I mean?</b>

895
00:46:06,019 --> 00:46:08,836
<b>It's better to show your face
for two seconds...</b>

896

<b>than the back of your head
for 10 seconds.</b>

897
00:46:10,899 --> 00:46:11,905
<b>At a 35-degree angle.</b>

898
00:46:11,929 --> 00:46:13,145
<b>It's better to show your face

900
00:46:14,399 --> 00:46:17,600
<b>You guys should be shrewder.
You still have a long way to go.</b>

901
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:20,316
<b>Jeong Bong, go to the fridge
and get me some coke.</b>

902
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:22,145
<b>I'm thirsty after the lecture.</b>

903
00:46:22,169 --> 00:46:23,210
<b>Okay.</b>

904
00:46:27,779 --> 00:46:29,409
<b>Who are you?</b>

905
00:46:31,620 --> 00:46:33,220
<b>Ga Hee, you're home.</b>

906
00:46:33,590 --> 00:46:36,320
<b>Did you do something wrong?
Why are you stammering?</b>

907

<b>Who are they?</b>

908
00:46:44,899 --> 00:46:48,169
<b>I see. I must admit
that you're a man of loyalty.</b>

909
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:52,639
<b>But you should think

<b>No. This just isn't right.
I can't keep it a secret.</b>

<b>Gosh, what are you doing?</b>

923
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:26,539
<b>All right. Fine.</b>

924
00:47:26,909 --> 00:47:29,409

- We're pros. Let's not do this.</b>

<b>I'm behind on my credit card

933

941
00:48:12,350 --> 00:48:13,720
<b>I'll go easy on you.</b>

942

<b>Don't get all upset about it.</b>

943

<b>We're on a ship

<b>Yes.</b>

<b>Isn't she beautiful?
She's like a goddess.</b>

<b>Really? I don't like tall women.</b>

958
00:49:09,509 --> 00:49:11,885
<b>And her eyes are too big
that they look a little scary.</b>

959
00:49:11,909 --> 00:49:15,580
<b>Right. She's a goddess

<b>Joon Seon, did it go well?</b>

<b>Okay?</b>

968
00:49:40,970 --> 00:49:44,580

978
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:30,789
<b>There's your uncle.</b>

<b>I know.</b>

992
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:14,929
<b>The rain reminds me of the old days.</b>

993
00:51:15,230 --> 00:51:18,899
<b>My first love liked
getting caught in the rain.</b>

994

<b>Which one? The guy who ran away
with your money?</b>

995
00:51:22,570 --> 00:51:25,639
<b>Gosh, he was nice at heart.
He was just in a tough situation.</b>

996
00:51:25,909 --> 00:51:27,426
<b>Look at you getting angry again.</b>

997
00:51:27,450 --> 00:51:30,379
<b>A naive girl like you always
ends up with a bad guy.</b>

998

<b>He had a good heart though.</b>

999
00:51:32,980 --> 00:51:36,460
<b>Right. They say to condemn the sin,
but not the sinner.</b>

1000
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:40,035
<b>Isn't that from the Bible?
You're Buddhist.</b>

1001

<b>It doesn't matter whether it's from
the Bible or Buddhist scriptures.</b>

1002

<b>We just need to heed
all good sayings.</b>

1003

<b>The coffee tastes so good.</b>

<b>The guy from the hardware store
bought 10 to go.</b>

<b>He's been here quite a lot lately.
He might be a frequent customer.</b>

1008

<b>It's nice to have a regular.</b>

1009
00:51:59,980 --> 00:52:03,226
<b>Since we're running a diner

<b>we should have more regulars.</b>

<b>Okay.</b>

1013

<b>Don't worry about it.</b>

<b>Well done.</b>

<b>The spring rain is pouring

1017
00:52:22,799 --> 00:52:24,399
<b>I like the sound of rain though.</b>

1018

<b>Spring rain</b>

<b>Spring rain that makes me cry</b>

<b>Ma'am, I knew you'd be doing this.</b>

1025

<b>You should've brought an umbrella.
Did you not see the news?</b>

1026
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:57,745
<b>I had no time.</b>

1027
00:52:57,769 --> 00:52:59,500
<b>- Here.
- Gosh.</b>

1028
00:52:59,740 --> 00:53:02,446
<b>If it rains a lot,
just go home early.</b>

1029

<b>It's a loss if you get sick.</b>

1030
00:53:04,910 --> 00:53:06,825
<b>I should get going then. Bye.</b>

1031
00:53:06,849 --> 00:53:09,210
<b>Gosh, thank you.</b>

1032
00:53:09,750 --> 00:53:11,555
<b>Do you want some cucumbers?</b>

1033
00:53:11,579 --> 00:53:12,656
<b>No, it's okay.</b>

1034
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:14,896
<b>Cucumbers are expensive these days.
You should sell them.</b>

1035

<b>Bye.</b>

1036
00:53:17,289 --> 00:53:18,289
<b>My gosh.</b>

1037
00:53:18,890 --> 00:53:20,460
<b>What do I do with them?</b>

1038
00:53:25,230 --> 00:53:28,599
<b>I guess she brought
an umbrella today.</b>

1039
00:53:29,230 --> 00:53:30,670
<b>She always forgets to bring one.</b>

1040
00:53:35,039 --> 00:53:36,680
<b>I hope she won't catch a cold.</b>

1041
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:38,956
<b>My gosh.</b>

1042
00:53:38,980 --> 00:53:40,426
<b>Why are you back?</b>

1043
00:53:40,450 --> 00:53:42,530
<b>Didn't you go to take
the vegetable lady an umbrella?</b>

1044
00:53:42,779 --> 00:53:44,279
<b>She has one already.</b>

1045
00:53:45,220 --> 00:53:48,666
<b>What's up with her?
She always forgets to bring it.</b>

1046
00:53:48,690 --> 00:53:51,595
<b>She would rather bring more carrots
instead of an umbrella.</b>

1047
00:53:51,619 --> 00:53:53,966
<b>So she always gets caught
in the rain.</b>

1048
00:53:53,990 --> 00:53:55,160
<b>I know.</b>

1049
00:53:55,759 --> 00:53:57,176
<b>Where's Hyo Sin?
Is he out for delivery?</b>

1050
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:00,900
<b>Yes. We are getting a lot of
delivery orders because of the rain.</b>

1051
00:54:01,099 --> 00:54:04,376
<b>He's quite nimble and taciturn.</b>

1052
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:06,376
<b>I'm glad that we started delivery.</b>

1053
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:08,245
<b>It's good enough to offset his pay.</b>

1054
00:54:08,269 --> 00:54:11,240
<b>It's good that our sales are rising,</b>

1055
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:14,079
<b>but it's a serious problem
that people are growing lazy.</b>

1056
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:16,595
<b>They should do some legwork.</b>

1057
00:54:16,619 --> 00:54:18,819
<b>All they do is
just move some fingers.</b>

1058
00:54:19,049 --> 00:54:23,519
<b>Then they would pay money
and join a gym to lose weight.</b>

1059
00:54:23,759 --> 00:54:25,535
<b>Why would they spend
double the money?</b>

1060
00:54:25,559 --> 00:54:27,166
<b>Walking around is good exercise.</b>

1061
00:54:27,190 --> 00:54:30,005
<b>It's just how the world changes.</b>

1062
00:54:30,029 --> 00:54:32,706
<b>Stop worrying about someone
else's money and fry chickens.</b>

1063
00:54:32,730 --> 00:54:34,329
<b>We're running out already.</b>

1064
00:54:35,099 --> 00:54:36,106
<b>Where's Ok Ja?</b>

1065
00:54:36,130 --> 00:54:38,376
<b>I don't know.
She was feeling sleepy,</b>

1066
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:40,745
<b>so she went out for vitamin drinks,
but she hasn't come back.</b>

1067
00:54:40,769 --> 00:54:44,315
<b>She's just busy
meddling in everything.</b>

1068
00:54:44,339 --> 00:54:46,710
<b>That's because she's healthy.</b>

1069
00:54:46,849 --> 00:54:49,609
<b>If she was healthier,
she would never come back.</b>

1070
00:54:49,950 --> 00:54:53,055
<b>She always chatters away
without getting married.</b>

1071
00:54:53,079 --> 00:54:56,735
<b>I just hope she gets a crush
on someone and marries him.</b>

1072
00:54:56,759 --> 00:54:59,095
<b>Gosh. She's waited
for such a long time.</b>

1073
00:54:59,119 --> 00:55:01,230
<b>She can't just marry anyone.</b>

1074
00:55:01,359 --> 00:55:03,106
<b>Actually, she is
quite picky about men.</b>

1075
00:55:03,130 --> 00:55:06,500
<b>I know.
I mean she can't afford to be picky.</b>

1076
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:09,230
<b>Why would she care about looks?
It's just useless.</b>

1077
00:55:09,369 --> 00:55:12,146
<b>And she doesn't like older guys
because they look old.</b>

1078
00:55:12,170 --> 00:55:15,940
<b>She's so immature and childish.
Gosh, she's unbelievable.</b>

1079
00:55:19,839 --> 00:55:21,009
<b>My ears are burning.</b>

1080
00:55:22,779 --> 00:55:25,680
<b>Is someone talking about me?
Why is it so itchy?</b>

1081
00:55:27,450 --> 00:55:30,789
<b>It's Ok Ja. Ok Ja!</b>

1082
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:54,680
<b>You saved me.</b>

1083
00:55:55,250 --> 00:55:57,849
<b>If not for you,
I'd be completely drenched.</b>

1084
00:55:58,180 --> 00:56:00,349
<b>That would look bad.
Where are you headed?</b>

1085
00:56:01,089 --> 00:56:04,190
<b>- What?
- Where are you headed?</b>

1086
00:56:07,430 --> 00:56:10,176
<b>I'm going to the supermarket.</b>

1087
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:12,735
<b>Then drop me off at my store.</b>

1088
00:56:12,759 --> 00:56:14,470
<b>I'll buy you coffee later.</b>

1089
00:56:15,269 --> 00:56:16,606
<b>Okay. Why not?</b>

1090
00:56:16,630 --> 00:56:18,676
<b>Thank you so very much.</b>

1091
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:20,140
<b>Let's go!</b>

1092
00:56:54,609 --> 00:56:55,609
<b>Do you feel cold?</b>

1093
00:56:55,740 --> 00:56:58,640
<b>Then drink some hot water
at my store.</b>

1094
00:57:01,750 --> 00:57:03,880
<b>No. I'm okay.</b>

1095
00:57:04,750 --> 00:57:05,819
<b>I'm fine.</b>

1096
00:57:11,589 --> 00:57:14,660
<b>Jeong Bong.
You should go to a pharmacy.</b>

1097
00:57:14,829 --> 00:57:16,230
<b>Why won't your hiccups stop?</b>

1098
00:57:18,329 --> 00:57:21,000
<b>No. I'm okay.</b>

1099
00:57:22,630 --> 00:57:23,970
<b>Let's get along.</b>

1100
00:57:25,970 --> 00:57:26,970
<b>Okay.</b>

1101
00:57:33,009 --> 00:57:35,049
<b>(Hiccup)</b>

1102
00:57:35,809 --> 00:57:38,119
<b>(Hiccup)</b>

1103
00:57:40,390 --> 00:57:41,490
<b>Welcome...</b>

1104
00:57:43,019 --> 00:57:44,859
<b>Welcome.</b>

1105
00:57:49,230 --> 00:57:51,059
<b>One iced americano.</b>

1106
00:57:51,259 --> 00:57:54,170
<b>One iced americano.
You're paying by card.</b>

1107
00:57:54,799 --> 00:57:56,769
<b>You said "for one day".</b>

1108
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:59,345
<b>Here's your iced americano.</b>

1109
00:57:59,369 --> 00:58:01,245
<b>You don't eat for 16 hours.</b>

1110
00:58:01,269 --> 00:58:02,315
<b>16 hours, 8 hours.</b>

1111
00:58:02,339 --> 00:58:04,315
<b>You divide the day
into 16 hours and 8 hours.</b>

1112
00:58:04,339 --> 00:58:06,309
<b>- Give me some cold water.
- Pardon?</b>

1113
00:58:06,950 --> 00:58:08,156
<b>Oh, okay.</b>

1114
00:58:08,180 --> 00:58:10,025
<b>For 20 hours...</b>

1115
00:58:10,049 --> 00:58:12,055
<b>First. The look in your eyes.</b>

1116
00:58:12,079 --> 00:58:13,990
<b>The second part is
about how you speak.</b>

1117
00:58:14,119 --> 00:58:16,349
<b>You must always be firm.</b>

1118
00:58:19,119 --> 00:58:20,660
<b>A firm tone.</b>

1119
00:58:22,660 --> 00:58:23,829
<b>Excuse me?</b>

1120
00:58:24,329 --> 00:58:25,400
<b>What?</b>

1121
00:58:25,599 --> 00:58:29,029
<b>As that sign says,
you must get your own water.</b>

1122
00:58:29,299 --> 00:58:32,176
<b>I'd be grateful
if you got it yourself.</b>

1123
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:33,200
<b>What?</b>

1124
00:58:34,539 --> 00:58:36,210
<b>That's our rule.</b>

1125
00:58:36,410 --> 00:58:37,710
<b>And also,</b>

1126
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:41,085
<b>you could inconvenience
other customers.</b>

1127
00:58:41,109 --> 00:58:43,049
<b>Please use earphones.</b>

1128
00:58:44,980 --> 00:58:46,279
<b>Okay.</b>

1129
00:58:47,220 --> 00:58:49,220
<b>I had to get my own water?</b>

1130
00:58:49,589 --> 00:58:51,160
<b>You should've said so.</b>

1131
00:59:12,140 --> 00:59:13,710
<b>Thank you.</b>

1132
00:59:17,750 --> 00:59:19,579
<b>Hey. I'm outside my place.</b>

1133
00:59:20,150 --> 00:59:22,720
<b>Tripe? What's the occasion?</b>

1134
00:59:23,150 --> 00:59:24,619
<b>You got a bonus?</b>

1135
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:26,936
<b>Then I must come and eat.</b>

1136
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:28,329
<b>I'll be right there.</b>

1137
00:59:30,190 --> 00:59:31,636
<b>- Mr. Yoon!
- My gosh.</b>

1138
00:59:31,660 --> 00:59:33,630
<b>- You startled me.
- Congratulate me.</b>

1139
00:59:33,829 --> 00:59:35,545
<b>How did you know I was here?</b>

1140
00:59:35,569 --> 00:59:36,976
<b>I was watching from inside.</b>

1141
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,116
<b>- Mr. Yoon. I did it.
- Do what?</b>

1142
00:59:39,140 --> 00:59:41,116
<b>That customer, the suede bag woman.</b>

1143
00:59:41,140 --> 00:59:42,245
<b>She came back.</b>

1144
00:59:42,269 --> 00:59:44,686
<b>And she asked me to bring her water.</b>

1145
00:59:44,710 --> 00:59:47,349
<b>So I glared at her and firmly said,</b>

1146
00:59:47,549 --> 00:59:49,549
<b>"Get your own water."</b>

1147
00:59:50,210 --> 00:59:53,495
<b>She went and got the water
and she didn't complain either!</b>

1148
00:59:53,519 --> 00:59:55,196
<b>You did great.</b>

1149
00:59:55,220 --> 00:59:57,619
<b>See? It works if you try.</b>

1150
00:59:59,490 --> 01:00:01,136
<b>Mr. Yoon, are you off work?</b>

1151
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:03,359
<b>To thank you, I'll buy you a drink.</b>

1152
01:00:07,369 --> 01:00:10,740
<b>Okay. We must celebrate. Let's go.</b>

1153
01:00:13,470 --> 01:00:15,416
<b>- Here you go.
- Thank you.</b>

1154
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:17,279
<b>- Goodbye.
- Thank you.</b>

1155
01:00:17,579 --> 01:00:18,809
<b>Gyu Jin.</b>

1156
01:00:19,609 --> 01:00:20,650
<b>Bo Young.</b>

1157
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:22,609
<b>Are you leaving work?</b>

1158
01:00:22,980 --> 01:00:24,456
<b>I almost missed you.</b>

1159
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:25,956
<b>I was going to call.</b>

1160
01:00:25,980 --> 01:00:27,650
<b>I'm meeting someone.</b>

1161
01:00:28,950 --> 01:00:32,759
<b>Oh, is he getting discharged?
I had no idea.</b>

1162
01:00:33,460 --> 01:00:35,230
<b>I thought it would be
a few more days,</b>

1163
01:00:35,329 --> 01:00:38,029
<b>but Dr. Song said she thinks
he can go home today.</b>

1164
01:00:38,559 --> 01:00:41,106
<b>He got better much quicker here
than at the other hospital.</b>

1165
01:00:41,130 --> 01:00:43,269
<b>Your wife's a great doctor.</b>

1166
01:00:43,769 --> 01:00:44,799
<b>Yes.</b>

1167
01:00:45,799 --> 01:00:48,339
<b>- Where's Si Hoo?
- With the nurses.</b>

1168
01:00:49,369 --> 01:00:52,315
<b>They finally became friends
and now they must part.</b>

1169
01:00:52,339 --> 01:00:53,710
<b>It's a good thing.</b>

1170
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:56,009
<b>The shorter you stay here,
the better.</b>

1171
01:00:56,180 --> 01:00:57,380
<b>I guess so.</b>

1172
01:00:58,380 --> 01:01:00,095
<b>Still, it's a bit upsetting.</b>

1173
01:01:00,119 --> 01:01:01,825
<b>We met after a long time.</b>

1174
01:01:01,849 --> 01:01:03,936
<b>We can always meet up again.</b>

1175
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:07,305
<b>Let's meet elsewhere next time.
With people from the church.</b>

1176
01:01:07,329 --> 01:01:08,829
<b>Okay, let's do that.</b>

1177
01:01:13,329 --> 01:01:15,000
<b>- Gyu Jin?
- What?</b>

1178
01:01:18,069 --> 01:01:19,599
<b>I want to thank you.</b>

1179
01:01:21,069 --> 01:01:22,170
<b>I'll call.</b>

1180
01:01:22,470 --> 01:01:23,539
<b>Okay.</b>

1181
01:01:23,980 --> 01:01:25,309
<b>Say bye to Si Hoo for me.</b>

1182
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:26,839
<b>I will.</b>

1183
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:34,849
<b>Wait, Gyu Jin.</b>

1184
01:01:41,130 --> 01:01:42,160
<b>Ms. Song.</b>

1185
01:01:42,789 --> 01:01:44,730
<b>Cheers.</b>

1186
01:01:50,130 --> 01:01:52,916
<b>On a day like this,
we must drink outside.</b>

1187
01:01:52,940 --> 01:01:55,839
<b>Yes. The weather is just amazing.</b>

1188
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:57,710
<b>It's strange.</b>

1189
01:01:57,910 --> 01:02:00,386
<b>I thought that
if I talked to a customer like that,</b>

1190
01:02:00,410 --> 01:02:03,720
<b>I'd feel uncomfortable,
but I felt so good.</b>

1191
01:02:04,680 --> 01:02:07,025
<b>It's oddly cathartic.</b>

1192
01:02:07,049 --> 01:02:08,525
<b>Now I'm worried.</b>

1193
01:02:08,549 --> 01:02:11,589
<b>What if this catches on
and you become outspoken and snarky?</b>

1194
01:02:12,490 --> 01:02:13,660
<b>Like Na Hee?</b>

1195
01:02:13,789 --> 01:02:15,789
<b>Yes. Like Na Hee.</b>

1196
01:02:18,529 --> 01:02:21,369
<b>Well, I like Na Hee,</b>

1197
01:02:21,470 --> 01:02:25,116
<b>but you should be yourself.
It's boring if you're like her.</b>

1198
01:02:25,140 --> 01:02:27,109
<b>You can change just a bit.</b>

1199
01:02:27,269 --> 01:02:29,039
<b>Just say what you must.</b>

1200
01:02:29,069 --> 01:02:31,279
<b>Anyway, thank you so much.</b>

1201
01:02:31,339 --> 01:02:33,680
<b>It'll be a great help in life.</b>

1202
01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:35,150
<b>You're welcome.</b>

1203
01:02:35,349 --> 01:02:36,349
<b>Cheers.</b>

1204
01:02:45,619 --> 01:02:48,466
<b>I get this impression
whenever we meet,</b>

1205
01:02:48,490 --> 01:02:51,460
<b>but you have a great personality.
I'm envious.</b>

1206
01:02:51,529 --> 01:02:54,069
<b>I turned out this way
despite having the mom that I have,</b>

1207
01:02:54,130 --> 01:02:56,400
<b>so I guess I am a great guy.</b>

1208
01:02:57,400 --> 01:03:00,269
<b>Why? I like Ms. Choi.</b>

1209
01:03:00,369 --> 01:03:02,069
<b>She's very sensitive.</b>

1210
01:03:03,039 --> 01:03:04,039
<b>Sensitive?</b>

1211
01:03:04,779 --> 01:03:07,009
<b>That's a good way of putting it.</b>

1212
01:03:08,410 --> 01:03:10,079
<b>She's too moody.</b>

1213
01:03:10,950 --> 01:03:13,025
<b>She's really nice when she's happy,</b>

1214
01:03:13,049 --> 01:03:15,196
<b>but if something upsets her
even a little bit,</b>

1215
01:03:15,220 --> 01:03:17,049
<b>she throws punches.</b>

1216
01:03:18,359 --> 01:03:19,390
<b>You're right.</b>

1217
01:03:19,859 --> 01:03:21,990
<b>She was in a bad mood all day today.</b>

1218
01:03:22,029 --> 01:03:25,460
<b>Yesterday, she was happy,
and she talked a lot,</b>

1219
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:28,446
<b>and even suggested we share a cake.</b>

1220
01:03:28,470 --> 01:03:29,500
<b>See?</b>

1221
01:03:30,230 --> 01:03:31,670
<b>That's why...</b>

1222
01:03:32,140 --> 01:03:34,069
<b>I fled to Turkey.</b>

1223
01:03:34,740 --> 01:03:38,180
<b>She smothers you with love,
and then with anger.</b>

1224
01:03:39,539 --> 01:03:42,279
<b>Gyu Jin is sweeter than me,</b>

1225
01:03:42,309 --> 01:03:44,019
<b>so he goes along with it.</b>

1226
01:03:45,019 --> 01:03:46,480
<b>It's too much for me.</b>

1227
01:03:47,190 --> 01:03:49,950
<b>It's because she's too lonely.</b>

1228
01:03:50,049 --> 01:03:51,890
<b>Be a little nicer to her.</b>

1229
01:03:52,589 --> 01:03:56,059
<b>I want to, but it's hard.</b>

1230
01:03:56,460 --> 01:03:58,059
<b>I keep wanting to run away.</b>

1231
01:03:59,029 --> 01:04:01,769
<b>If you don't get along,
you can just live apart.</b>

1232
01:04:02,329 --> 01:04:06,400
<b>I read somewhere that even parents
and kids have a compatibility count.</b>

1233
01:04:06,539 --> 01:04:09,116
<b>If that count is low,
it's much better to live apart.</b>

1234
01:04:09,140 --> 01:04:10,656
<b>I want to live apart.</b>

1235
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:12,309
<b>She dragged me home.</b>

1236
01:04:13,009 --> 01:04:16,710
<b>It's all because I helped keep
Gyu Jin and Na Hee's divorce secret.</b>

1237
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:18,750
<b>What?</b>

1238
01:04:19,119 --> 01:04:20,349
<b>What?</b>

1239
01:04:22,349 --> 01:04:23,349
<b>What?</b>

1240
01:04:24,119 --> 01:04:25,359
<b>What did you say?</b>

1241
01:04:26,119 --> 01:04:28,065
<b>Gyu Jin and Na Hee did what?</b>

1242
01:04:28,089 --> 01:04:31,275
<b>Oh, I don't know.
What did I just say?</b>

1243
01:04:31,299 --> 01:04:33,976
<b>I'm so tired that I spoke nonsense.</b>

1244
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:37,269
<b>Gyu Jin and Na Hee are divorced?</b>

1245
01:04:43,210 --> 01:04:44,279
<b>I...</b>

1246
01:04:45,339 --> 01:04:46,980
<b>lied to you.</b>

1247
01:04:49,809 --> 01:04:50,880
<b>The truth is,</b>

1248
01:04:51,880 --> 01:04:53,319
<b>Si Hoo has no dad.</b>

1249
01:04:54,190 --> 01:04:55,650
<b>I had him alone.</b>

1250
01:05:00,289 --> 01:05:02,789
<b>I never found that shameful,</b>

1251
01:05:03,490 --> 01:05:05,730
<b>but I just couldn't tell you.</b>

1252
01:05:06,460 --> 01:05:08,069
<b>I don't know why.</b>

1253
01:05:08,869 --> 01:05:11,216
<b>You became a doctor...</b>

1254
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:13,099
<b>and have a beautiful wife.</b>

1255
01:05:14,869 --> 01:05:16,839
<b>I felt so shabby.</b>

1256
01:05:17,740 --> 01:05:19,539
<b>Maybe that's why.</b>

1257
01:05:20,650 --> 01:05:22,809
<b>To be honest, even right now,</b>

1258
01:05:23,380 --> 01:05:24,950
<b>I feel embarrassed.</b>

1259
01:05:25,980 --> 01:05:28,950
<b>This is unbelievable.
Are they in a romance movie?</b>

1260
01:05:30,019 --> 01:05:31,059
<b>For what reason?</b>

1261
01:05:31,890 --> 01:05:33,160
<b>You really shouldn't be.</b>

1262
01:05:35,589 --> 01:05:36,759
<b>It's not like...</b>

1263
01:05:37,799 --> 01:05:39,829
<b>my life is any better.</b>

1264
01:05:44,500 --> 01:05:45,740
<b>Actually, I...</b>

1265
01:05:50,609 --> 01:05:51,609
<b>Na Hee!</b>

1266
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:12,805
<b>Jae Hyung, are you all right?</b>

1267
01:06:12,829 --> 01:06:13,970
<b>(Epilogue)</b>

1268
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:16,676
<b>Does anyone have a handkerchief?</b>

1269
01:06:16,700 --> 01:06:19,470
<b>He's bleeding too much.
We should take him to the infirmary.</b>

1270
01:06:21,309 --> 01:06:23,240
<b>Here. Let me.</b>

1271
01:06:24,539 --> 01:06:25,579
<b>I'll take that.</b>

1272
01:06:25,980 --> 01:06:27,279
<b>Are you all right?</b>

1273
01:06:27,750 --> 01:06:28,980
<b>I need dressing...</b>

1274
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:30,880
<b>Well...</b>

1275
01:06:31,549 --> 01:06:32,749
<b>Doesn't anyone have a bandage?</b>

1276
01:06:46,329 --> 01:06:48,369
<b>Could someone
please call an ambulance?</b>

1277
01:06:52,769 --> 01:06:55,686
<b>Seong Gyun,
is Gyu Jin perhaps inside?</b>

1278
01:06:55,710 --> 01:06:57,146
<b>He said he'd meet me here.</b>

1279
01:06:57,170 --> 01:06:59,509
<b>No, he's not.
Maybe you should call him.</b>

1280
01:07:00,079 --> 01:07:01,079
<b>Right.</b>

1281
01:07:07,990 --> 01:07:10,966
<b>Bo Young, practice will begin soon.
You should come inside.</b>

1282
01:07:10,990 --> 01:07:12,059
<b>Sure.</b>

1283
01:07:26,369 --> 01:07:27,869
<b>You did well, Na Hee.</b>

1284
01:07:28,109 --> 01:07:29,545
<b>You were quite calm yourself.</b>

1285
01:07:29,569 --> 01:07:31,369
<b>It wasn't as impressive
as your fast-thinking.</b>

1286
01:07:32,009 --> 01:07:34,085
<b>Are you okay though?
The skirt looks expensive.</b>

1287
01:07:34,109 --> 01:07:35,186
<b>It's cheap.</b>

1288
01:07:35,210 --> 01:07:37,250
<b>If it weren't, I would've ripped
your shirt instead.</b>

1289
01:07:39,079 --> 01:07:40,950
<b>Since I sacrificed my skirt,</b>

1290
01:07:41,519 --> 01:07:44,359
<b>you should buy me a meal.
I'm hungry, you know.</b>

1291
01:08:19,420 --> 01:08:21,829
<b>(Once Again)</b>

1292
01:08:22,430 --> 01:08:25,735
<b>This is absolutely insane!
How are they going to explain this?</b>

1293
01:08:25,759 --> 01:08:28,106
<b>I'm dead
if they find out I told you.</b>

1294
01:08:28,130 --> 01:08:29,946
<b>My brother is super scary
when he's angry.</b>

1295
01:08:29,970 --> 01:08:30,976
<b>The real doctors argue about...</b>

1296
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:32,575
<b>which treatments are the best.</b>

1297
01:08:32,599 --> 01:08:35,045
<b>Let us introduce you
to our new panel of doctors.</b>

1298
01:08:35,069 --> 01:08:37,555
<b>That's right.
They're on "Doctors".</b>

1299
01:08:37,579 --> 01:08:39,315
<b>He's my son
and she's my daughter-in-law.</b>

1300
01:08:39,339 --> 01:08:40,609
<b>- Goodness.
- How nice.</b>

1301
01:08:41,049 --> 01:08:43,180
<b>No, this can't be true.</b>

1302
01:08:43,650 --> 01:08:46,349
<b>Calm down, my beating heart.</b>

1303
01:08:48,720 --> 01:08:50,795
<b>Is this the dance sports class?</b>

1304
01:08:50,819 --> 01:08:53,220
<b>I'm here to take lessons too.</b>
