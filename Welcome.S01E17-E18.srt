67
00:04:31,389 --> 00:04:33,966
<b>You're right. I thought she quit...</b>

68
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:35,950
<b>because we said we didn't like
her work last time.</b>

69

<b>You guys should take a look.
It's a lot better.</b>

70

<b>I gave her some tips

<b>You've been writing about

79

<b>Why did I say that to her?</b>

80

<b>You've traveled a lot,

<b>I guess you haven't been
to a lot of places in Korea.</b>

83
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,200
<b>The place we're going
is near the sea.</b>

84
00:05:39,259 --> 00:05:40,290
<b>- "The sea"?
- Yes.</b>

85
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,259
<b>I love watching the sunset

86
00:05:43,529 --> 00:05:44,860
<b>It reminds me of a peach.</b>

87
00:05:46,459 --> 00:05:49,300
<b>- Do you want to go with me?
- Sure. Sounds nice.</b>

88
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:07,620
<b>How far are you going to go?</b>

89
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:09,220
<b>She won't believe me.</b>

90
00:06:11,889 --> 00:06:13,849
<b>I want you to get off with me
at the next station.</b>

91
00:06:14,189 --> 00:06:15,466
<b>You want me to send her there
on her own?</b>

92
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:16,706
<b>You promised to leave.</b>

93
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:19,060
<b>I don't want to run away
just because I know it'll end.</b>

94
00:06:19,899 --> 00:06:21,779
<b>That's exactly what
you've been doing until now.</b>

95
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:25,000
<b>- What?
- I don't want to run away.</b>

96
00:06:27,069 --> 00:06:28,269
<b>What if Sol Ah runs away?</b>

97
00:06:30,209 --> 00:06:31,870
<b>Why do you think
she can't believe you?</b>

98
00:06:33,339 --> 00:06:35,339
<b>Maybe it's because she doesn't
want to believe you.</b>

99
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:40,050
<b>If I get abandoned, then so be it.</b>

100
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:42,990
<b>I have no control over that.</b>

101
00:06:44,019 --> 00:06:45,089
<b>But...</b>

102
00:06:46,589 --> 00:06:47,819
<b>I won't abandon her first...</b>

103
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:50,329
<b>just so I could avoid
being abandoned.</b>

104
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,699
<b>I won't be like you.</b>

105
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:12,949
<b>Look at that.</b>

106
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,430

108
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,036
<b>That will look good on you.</b>

109
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,037
<b>- Really?
- Yes.</b>

110
00:07:28,061 --> 00:07:29,230
<b>I want to see it up close.</b>

111
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,230
<b>It's pretty.</b>

112
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:34,070

- Yes, it does.</b>

113
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:40,009
<b>- What are you doing?
- We're getting a birthday gift.</b>

114
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:41,660
<b>You're even going to meet
her parents?</b>

115
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:43,726
<b>Sol Ah's father has a weak heart.</b>

116
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:44,850
<b>I know.</b>

117
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:48,120
<b>Don't make things worse.</b>

118
00:07:49,019 --> 00:07:50,889
<b>- You can't go there.
- I know.</b>

119
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,720
<b>Guk Bong, what about this?

- Okay.</b>

121
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:58,029

122
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:00,399

123

<b>Really?</b>

124
00:08:04,569 --> 00:08:05,699
<b>Give me some money.</b>

125
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:09,209
<b>- What?
- I worked part-time. I want my pay.</b>

126
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,250
<b>- Ma'am, here you go.
- Thank you.</b>

127

128

<b>Wouldn't it be uncomfortable?</b>

129
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,089
<b>Why? Can't I go?</b>

130

<b>You're shy around people.</b>

131

<b>I also want to celebrate

<b>It's been a while,

134
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,840
<b>I'd like some premium Korean beef.</b>

135

139

<b>Hello, can I ask you something?</b>

140

<b>You can't go any further than this.</b>

141

<b>Yes, I know where they live.</b>

146

<b>Keep going up this way.</b>

147
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:43,269
<b>Then turn right.</b>

148
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:46,370
<b>Then keep walking straight.</b>

149
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:48,576

150
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,309
<b>Hey, don't ask her stuff.</b>

151

<b>- She's senile.
- My goodness.</b>

152
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,385
<b>I'm not senile.
You're the one who's senile.</b>

00:10:08,259 --> 00:10:09,860
<b>Oh, hello.</b>

156
00:10:11,389 --> 00:10:13,259
<b>By the way,</b>

157
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:16,129
<b>I brought someone with me.</b>

158
00:10:17,629 --> 00:10:18,830
<b>Who?</b>

159
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:24,269
<b>That handsome young man?</b>

160
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,610
<b>You brought your boyfriend.</b>

161
00:10:31,649 --> 00:10:32,779
<b>Where's Bang Guk Bong?</b>

162
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:33,995
<b>Guk Bong?</b>

163
00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:36,490
<b>Guk Bong left to take photos.</b>

164
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:38,789
<b>Oh, did he?</b>

165
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:44,159
<b>Why did he leave
without a word to me?</b>

166
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:48,529
<b>We should go. Get in.</b>

167
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:50,100
<b>Okay.</b>

168
00:10:51,299 --> 00:10:53,515
<b>Hey, did you just see that?</b>

169
00:10:53,539 --> 00:10:55,669
<b>A person turned into a cat.</b>

170
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:58,446
<b>I told you.</b>

171
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:00,216
<b>You are senile.</b>

172
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,940
<b>Hang on. Am I really?</b>

173
00:11:03,009 --> 00:11:05,409
<b>You really are out of your mind.</b>

174
00:11:05,509 --> 00:11:07,320
<b>I don't know what to do with you.</b>

175
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:16,929
<b>Thank you.</b>

176
00:11:19,129 --> 00:11:21,275
<b>You're so polite.</b>

177
00:11:21,299 --> 00:11:23,306
<b>You run a cafe?</b>

178
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:24,500
<b>Yes.</b>

179
00:11:26,299 --> 00:11:27,470
<b>Drink your tea.</b>

180
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:31,139
<b>Do you come by often
if you live opposite?</b>

181
00:11:31,909 --> 00:11:34,139
<b>Pardon? No, sir.</b>

182
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:35,440
<b>Why not?</b>

183
00:11:37,309 --> 00:11:39,279
<b>You should look in on my daughter.</b>

184
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:42,990
<b>Oh. I will.</b>

185
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:47,860
<b>Do you still give her a hard time?</b>

186
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:49,259
<b>Pardon?</b>

187
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:54,100
<b>I didn't say anything.</b>

188
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,330
<b>This is what he's like.</b>

189
00:11:56,929 --> 00:11:58,806
<b>He sees but pretends not to.</b>

190
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:00,500
<b>He knows but pretends not to.</b>

191
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,870
<b>You should date someone
who makes you feel comfortable.</b>

192
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,885
<b>Mr. Kim.</b>

193
00:12:06,909 --> 00:12:11,049
<b>Daughters fall for a man
who is just like her father.</b>

194
00:12:11,649 --> 00:12:14,395
<b>Jae Seon may seem cold
on the outside,</b>

195
00:12:14,419 --> 00:12:17,690
<b>but I'm sure he has
a warm heart on the inside.</b>

196
00:12:18,019 --> 00:12:19,320
<b>Right, Sol Ah?</b>

197
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:21,519
<b>I guess.</b>

198
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:26,259
<b>But...</b>

199
00:12:27,029 --> 00:12:28,529
<b>not anymore.</b>

200
00:12:28,929 --> 00:12:29,929
<b>What?</b>

201
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:39,710
<b>You're trying to flag down
a bus that already left.</b>

202
00:12:41,539 --> 00:12:44,809
<b>I'll explain when
Bang Guk Bong comes back.</b>

203
00:12:59,129 --> 00:13:00,600
<b>The long-haired guy.</b>

204
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:04,700
<b>It's my personal preference.</b>

205
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:06,570
<b>Come and sit down.</b>

206
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:17,049
<b>Sol Ah.</b>

207
00:13:17,309 --> 00:13:20,149
<b>You said you'd explain
when Guk Bong's here.</b>

208
00:13:22,419 --> 00:13:24,190
<b>You wanted to talk to me?</b>

209
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:26,259
<b>What?</b>

210
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:32,830
<b>- But...
- What's going on?</b>

211
00:13:33,929 --> 00:13:35,429
<b>My goodness.</b>

212
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:38,605
<b>Why are you acting like
you saw a ghost?</b>

213
00:13:38,629 --> 00:13:41,240
<b>No, it's... It's just...</b>

214
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:44,809
<b>I'm... I'm sorry, excuse me.</b>

215
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:46,409
<b>What...</b>

216
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,049
<b>I'm sorry. Excuse me.</b>

217
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:52,480
<b>Sol Ah.</b>

218
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:54,850
<b>Kim Sol Ah.</b>

219
00:13:57,049 --> 00:13:58,190
<b>What's going on?</b>

220
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:59,865
<b>Why is he Bang Guk Bong?</b>

221
00:13:59,889 --> 00:14:02,159
<b>He's not. You know he's not.</b>

222
00:14:04,429 --> 00:14:06,700
<b>The person you think
is Bang Guk Bong...</b>

223
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:10,200
<b>actually isn't.</b>

224
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:13,070
<b>Then what? Who is he?</b>

225
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,440
<b>Hong Jo.</b>

226
00:14:18,009 --> 00:14:20,655
<b>What... Why are you
acting weird too?</b>

227
00:14:20,679 --> 00:14:22,409
<b>Sol Ah. Hear me out.</b>

228
00:14:22,539 --> 00:14:25,009
<b>My head's about to split in two.</b>

229
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:27,580
<b>I need to think on my own.</b>

230
00:14:34,519 --> 00:14:35,559
<b>(Bus Stop)</b>

231
00:14:40,429 --> 00:14:41,460
<b>Where's Sol Ah?</b>

232
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:44,029
<b>She met the real Bang Guk Bong...</b>

233
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:46,105
<b>and freaked out.</b>

234
00:14:46,129 --> 00:14:47,340
<b>Where is she now?</b>

235
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:49,546
<b>She left to be alone.</b>

236
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:51,346
<b>So you just let her go?</b>

237
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:53,340
<b>Didn't you come here
to be at her side?</b>

238
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:57,480
<b>Where are you going?</b>

239
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:01,080
<b>To be at her side.</b>

240
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:25,669
<b>My mom told me to check on you.</b>

241
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:33,580
<b>Sol Ah!</b>

242
00:15:34,779 --> 00:15:36,149
<b>- Sol Ah.
- Sol Ah!</b>

243
00:15:36,889 --> 00:15:38,049
<b>Darn it.</b>

244
00:15:40,419 --> 00:15:41,620
<b>Sol Ah!</b>

245
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,529
<b>Kim Sol Ah.</b>

246
00:15:45,159 --> 00:15:46,500
<b>Sol Ah!</b>

247
00:15:47,159 --> 00:15:48,360
<b>Sol Ah!</b>

248
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:50,730
<b>Sol Ah...</b>

249
00:15:53,299 --> 00:15:56,100
<b>Is that the sea?</b>

250
00:15:57,539 --> 00:15:58,669
<b>You've never seen it before?</b>

251
00:15:59,539 --> 00:16:01,009
<b>Not in person.</b>

252
00:16:04,809 --> 00:16:06,779
<b>I promised to see it with Sol Ah.</b>

253
00:16:12,289 --> 00:16:13,559
<b>It's my fault.</b>

254
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:17,389
<b>I shouldn't have just watched.</b>

255
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:19,330
<b>Like you said.</b>

256
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:23,529
<b>Instead of just thinking,</b>

257
00:16:24,629 --> 00:16:26,070
<b>I should've taken action.</b>

258
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:45,019
<b>Should I have done this sooner?</b>

259
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:47,460
<b>What are you doing?</b>

260
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:01,840
<b>Are you...</b>

261
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,940
<b>the real Bang Guk Bong?</b>

262
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:08,210
<b>What?</b>

263
00:17:11,049 --> 00:17:12,049
<b>Yes.</b>

264
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:17,950
<b>I see.</b>

265
00:17:23,289 --> 00:17:25,529
<b>You're the real Bang Guk Bong.</b>

266
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:30,599
<b>Then...</b>

267
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:35,799
<b>who do you think he was?</b>

268
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:38,710
<b>Who do you mean?</b>

269
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:43,049
<b>I don't know...</b>

270
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:45,809
<b>who he is.</b>

271
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,289
<b>Until now,</b>

272
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:52,849
<b>we lived in the same house...</b>

273
00:17:54,519 --> 00:17:57,029
<b>and we ate together.</b>

274
00:17:58,329 --> 00:18:00,329
<b>We talked together.</b>

275
00:18:02,299 --> 00:18:03,470
<b>We even...</b>

276
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:12,809
<b>If I throw this down there,</b>

277
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:14,579
<b>what will happen?</b>

278
00:18:15,539 --> 00:18:16,710
<b>After that,</b>

279
00:18:17,309 --> 00:18:19,349
<b>I could just leave you here.</b>

280
00:18:20,819 --> 00:18:23,089
<b>Then you'll never
get to see Sol Ah again.</b>

281
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:26,490
<b>You'll live like an ordinary cat.</b>

282
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:31,329
<b>I had this perfect option.</b>

283
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,670
<b>When one abandons a pet,</b>

284
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:41,170
<b>I heard they take it as far away
from home as possible.</b>

285
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,170
<b>So they can't come back.</b>

286
00:18:49,079 --> 00:18:50,210
<b>Do it.</b>

287
00:18:52,279 --> 00:18:56,019
<b>I met Sol Ah and got to
spend time with her.</b>

288
00:18:56,079 --> 00:18:57,319
<b>I owe that to you.</b>

289
00:18:58,349 --> 00:19:00,220
<b>If you hadn't taken me in,</b>

290
00:19:00,819 --> 00:19:02,589
<b>I might be dead already.</b>

291
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,230
<b>Toss it.</b>

292
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,430
<b>You deserve to.</b>

293
00:19:11,829 --> 00:19:13,900
<b>Don't just stand there. Toss it.</b>

294
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,440
<b>Shall I?</b>

295
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,970
<b>If I throw it away,</b>

296
00:19:20,079 --> 00:19:21,579
<b>can I turn things back?</b>

297
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,119
<b>Will Sol Ah...</b>

298
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:33,859
<b>come back to me?</b>

299
00:19:36,359 --> 00:19:37,630
<b>If she does,</b>

300
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:40,099
<b>don't run away this time.</b>

301
00:19:40,529 --> 00:19:42,529
<b>And don't fear abandonment.</b>

302
00:19:43,029 --> 00:19:44,329
<b>Aren't you afraid?</b>

303
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:48,569
<b>You should fear being abandoned.</b>

304
00:19:50,269 --> 00:19:51,740
<b>You could die.</b>

305
00:19:52,569 --> 00:19:54,609
<b>Will you throw that or not?</b>

306
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,500
<b>Take it back.</b>

307
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,750
<b>Here. Take it back.</b>

308
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:43,730
<b>Are you kidding me?</b>

309
00:20:53,369 --> 00:20:54,500
<b>Are you done crying?</b>

310
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:57,470
<b>We're almost out of tissue paper.</b>

311
00:20:57,869 --> 00:20:59,710
<b>Can I just have one more?</b>

312
00:21:01,109 --> 00:21:02,549
<b>Do you still need to cry a bit more?</b>

313
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:04,250
<b>No.</b>

314
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:06,950
<b>I need to wipe my nose.</b>

315
00:21:12,019 --> 00:21:13,359
<b>Thank you.</b>

316
00:21:17,289 --> 00:21:19,430
<b>I don't know what's going on.</b>

317
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:22,630
<b>But...</b>

318
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,470
<b>is it because of Hong Jo?</b>

319
00:21:27,339 --> 00:21:29,940
<b>Do you know Hong Jo?</b>

320
00:21:31,269 --> 00:21:32,809
<b>I met him
when I went home last time.</b>

321
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:38,450
<b>Well...</b>

322
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:40,720
<b>Which one?</b>

323
00:21:42,119 --> 00:21:43,150
<b>Human?</b>

324
00:21:44,589 --> 00:21:45,650
<b>Or...</b>

325
00:21:46,759 --> 00:21:47,819
<b>a cat?</b>

326
00:21:48,289 --> 00:21:49,690
<b>What do you mean?</b>

327
00:21:50,829 --> 00:21:51,930
<b>Hong Jo...</b>

328
00:21:53,059 --> 00:21:54,730
<b>is the name of my cat.</b>

329
00:21:56,970 --> 00:21:59,069
<b>The Hong Jo I met was a guy.</b>

330
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:02,640
<b>And he told me his name is Hong Jo.</b>

331
00:22:03,869 --> 00:22:04,970
<b>I've been...</b>

332
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:09,809
<b>calling him by a different name.</b>

333
00:22:14,119 --> 00:22:15,279
<b>But...</b>

334
00:22:16,619 --> 00:22:20,890
<b>it turns out that wasn't his name.</b>

335
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:24,730
<b>I mean,</b>

336
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:28,930
<b>that's already absurd as it is.</b>

337
00:22:31,769 --> 00:22:32,829
<b>But...</b>

338
00:22:36,039 --> 00:22:37,609
<b>it even turns out...</b>

339
00:22:40,509 --> 00:22:42,180
<b>that he's actually a cat.</b>

340
00:22:44,849 --> 00:22:46,049
<b>Do you think that makes sense?</b>

341
00:22:51,049 --> 00:22:52,250
<b>Why aren't you startled?</b>

342
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:54,720
<b>You don't believe me, do you?</b>

343
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:57,329
<b>I do.</b>

344
00:22:58,259 --> 00:23:01,099
<b>When you travel around the world,
you see and hear so many things.</b>

345
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:03,630
<b>I've heard...</b>

346
00:23:04,529 --> 00:23:06,369
<b>of something similar.</b>

347
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,940
<b>This also happened to someone else?</b>

348
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,216
<b>A cat fell in love and...</b>

349
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,809
<b>Did it turn into a person?</b>

350
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:16,539
<b>It fell in love with a mouse.</b>

351
00:23:17,579 --> 00:23:18,650
<b>"A mouse"?</b>

352
00:23:19,049 --> 00:23:21,549
<b>Yes, a cat and a mouse.</b>

353
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,119
<b>It's nonsense, isn't it?</b>

354
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:28,359
<b>What does that have
anything to do with this?</b>

355
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:33,500
<b>Love is...</b>

356
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:36,160
<b>a miracle.</b>

357
00:23:50,779 --> 00:23:52,880
<b>It's not here. We can't find it.
Let's just go.</b>

358
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:57,349
<b>What's with that look?
Don't give me those eyes.</b>

359
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:00,920
<b>I'm not the one who threw it here.
You just failed to catch it.</b>

360
00:24:02,759 --> 00:24:04,230
<b>Just take something else.</b>

361
00:24:04,789 --> 00:24:06,029
<b>Does it have to be that ring?</b>

362
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:10,700
<b>Then why don't you
help me look for it?</b>

363
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:15,500
<b>I told you not to give me that look.</b>

364
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:52,440
<b>I found it. Hey, are we good now?</b>

365
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:56,440
<b>What?</b>

366
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,029
<b>Sol Ah.</b>

367
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:23,609
<b>I've been looking for you.</b>

368
00:25:26,609 --> 00:25:28,440
<b>How long have you known?</b>

369
00:25:31,009 --> 00:25:32,680
<b>I was closer to him than you.</b>

370
00:25:33,349 --> 00:25:34,880
<b>Maybe you were too close.</b>

371
00:25:39,089 --> 00:25:41,119
<b>I must've seemed pathetic.</b>

372
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:43,789
<b>I knew nothing.</b>

373
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:46,359
<b>No.</b>

374
00:25:47,599 --> 00:25:49,230
<b>I still don't get it.</b>

375
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:55,069
<b>I get that he isn't Bang Guk Bong.</b>

376
00:25:57,839 --> 00:25:59,109
<b>But I can't believe...</b>

377
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:02,910
<b>he's Hong Jo.</b>

378
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:08,049
<b>I just can't believe it.</b>

379
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,220
<b>Here.</b>

380
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:18,230
<b>That's Hong Jo's collar.</b>

381
00:26:20,059 --> 00:26:21,630
<b>How is this here?</b>

382
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:23,700
<b>Because Hong Jo came here, too.</b>

383
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:28,539
<b>He normally keeps it
underneath his shirt.</b>

384
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:33,839
<b>I was going to throw it
far away but..</b>

385
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:35,790
<b>You were going to throw it?</b>

386
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:37,950
<b>- Why?
- No.</b>

387
00:26:38,849 --> 00:26:40,079
<b>I didn't throw it.</b>

388
00:26:41,779 --> 00:26:43,890
<b>I mean, I did throw it.</b>

389
00:26:44,349 --> 00:26:46,789
<b>- But I didn't mean to.
- What are you saying?</b>

390
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:51,130
<b>Anyway, he's a cat right now.</b>

391
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,606
<b>He's probably lost somewhere.</b>

392
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:55,160
<b>But he's able to turn into a person.</b>

393
00:26:57,099 --> 00:26:59,799
<b>He can't do that anymore.
He doesn't have this.</b>

394
00:27:00,369 --> 00:27:01,470
<b>What about that?</b>

395
00:27:02,839 --> 00:27:05,170
<b>Is it a magic ring or something?</b>

396
00:27:06,170 --> 00:27:07,710
<b>It's not the ring. It's you.</b>

397
00:27:09,579 --> 00:27:10,779
<b>It's because this is yours.</b>

398
00:27:14,779 --> 00:27:15,980
<b>He needs you...</b>

399
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:18,759
<b>in order to turn into a person.</b>

400
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:22,190
<b>Why does he need me?</b>

401
00:27:23,119 --> 00:27:24,430
<b>No one knows why.</b>

402
00:27:25,789 --> 00:27:29,559
<b>Maybe it's magic or fate.
Or something similar.</b>

403
00:27:32,029 --> 00:27:33,329
<b>Love is...</b>

404
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:36,099
<b>a miracle.</b>

405
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:40,740
<b>Anyway, we need to find him.</b>

406
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:43,339
<b>It'll turn dark soon.</b>

407
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:45,609
<b>I think I know...</b>

408
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:48,450
<b>where he is.</b>

409
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:02,519
<b>I see it now.
Hong Jo, he has your eyes.</b>

410
00:29:35,059 --> 00:29:36,359
<b>I'm not Bang Guk Bong.</b>

411
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:39,789
<b>- Then who are you?
- Hong Jo.</b>

412
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:50,470
<b>It's colder than I expected.</b>

413
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:53,170
<b>I thought it'd be warm
like the color of a peach.</b>

414
00:30:58,369 --> 00:31:00,839
<b>How can there be any fishes
in the water when it's so cold?</b>

415
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,579
<b>They must be freezing.</b>

416
00:31:09,549 --> 00:31:11,019
<b>I didn't know you'd come.</b>

417
00:31:12,549 --> 00:31:14,309
<b>I thought I should at least
see it on my own.</b>

418
00:31:16,759 --> 00:31:18,589
<b>I wanted to see the sunset
by the sea.</b>

419
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:24,130
<b>You really changed into a person...</b>

420
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,299
<b>because I came here?</b>

421
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:41,250
<b>So it's true.</b>

422
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:49,720
<b>You're...</b>

423
00:31:54,059 --> 00:31:55,799
<b>You're really Hong Jo.</b>

<b>(Seolleung Station)</b>

426
00:33:46,010 --> 00:33:47,010
<b>What are you doing?</b>

427
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:50,709
<b>I was...</b>

428
00:33:53,049 --> 00:33:54,180
<b>The bus is here.</b>

429
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:55,750
<b>Two, please.</b>

430
00:33:57,250 --> 00:33:58,390
<b>Thank you.</b>

431
00:34:02,489 --> 00:34:03,659
<b>Sit over...</b>

432
00:34:18,769 --> 00:34:20,879
<b>You love to stare at my back.</b>

433
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:22,939
<b>Will this do?</b>

434
00:34:25,650 --> 00:34:27,519
<b>Just because we go in
the same direction...</b>

435
00:34:28,050 --> 00:34:30,490
<b>doesn't mean we must go together.</b>

436
00:34:30,689 --> 00:34:31,819
<b>I never said...</b>

437
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:34,319
<b>we should go together.</b>

438
00:34:38,430 --> 00:34:39,629
<b>Do you want to?</b>

439
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:44,330
<b>I don't want to bother you.</b>

440
00:34:47,039 --> 00:34:49,039
<b>Did Ms. Park say anything?</b>

441
00:34:51,669 --> 00:34:54,556
<b>It's dangerous.
You should face the front.</b>

442
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:55,580
<b>Okay.</b>

443
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:03,650
<b>Why did you sit behind me?</b>

444
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:07,259
<b>All this turning around
is giving me motion sickness.</b>

445

<b>I feel nauseous.</b>

446
00:35:11,490 --> 00:35:14,229
<b>That's why you should
face the front.</b>

447
00:35:15,759 --> 00:35:17,669
<b>I didn't eat anything
and I feel nauseous.</b>

448
00:35:18,469 --> 00:35:20,340
<b>Just face the front.</b>

449

<b>Shall we eat dinner?</b>

450

<b>Mister. Two meals, please.</b>

<b>Who is it?</b>

<b>Who is it?</b>

457
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:47,960
<b>Who should I say this is?</b>

458
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:53,316
<b>Should I say you're Doo Sik's
high school art club friend?</b>

459
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:54,840
<b>Or workplace senior?</b>

460
00:35:55,139 --> 00:35:58,639
<b>A neighborhood friend

<b>Why don't you just let them...</b>

<b>My gosh.</b>

<b>Why is she the wilting girl?</b>

466
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,126
<b>I have a wilting plant.</b>

467

<b>- What's wrong with it?
- Go on inside.</b>

<b>- Go inside.
- Come inside.</b>

469
00:36:29,639 --> 00:36:33,415
<b>Don't stare at her
while she's eating.</b>

470
00:36:33,439 --> 00:36:37,079
<b>We're just checking to make sure
she doesn't need anything.</b>

471
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:40,120
<b>Where are your parents?
Why do you live alone?</b>

472
00:36:40,449 --> 00:36:42,855
<b>They live in the country.</b>

473
00:36:42,879 --> 00:36:45,226
<b>- Oh, I see.
- I see.</b>

474
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:47,136
<b>You can't ask things like that.</b>

475
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:50,990
<b>He's right. Young people
these days hate things like that.</b>

476
00:36:51,389 --> 00:36:54,430
<b>Sensitivity is key when
communicating with youngsters.</b>

477
00:36:55,759 --> 00:36:59,100
<b>So, when did you move out?</b>

478
00:36:59,370 --> 00:37:02,915
<b>Oh, after graduating from
high school.</b>

479
00:37:02,939 --> 00:37:05,870
<b>Until then, I lived with my mom.</b>

480
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:07,509
<b>- And your father?
- Yes.</b>

481
00:37:07,779 --> 00:37:09,610
<b>He's not at home.</b>

482
00:37:13,879 --> 00:37:14,949
<b>Darn it.</b>

483
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:17,819
<b>I told you not to ask.</b>

484
00:37:18,050 --> 00:37:19,226
<b>What's wrong?</b>

485
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:22,120
<b>What's the matter? It's fine.</b>

486
00:37:22,519 --> 00:37:25,665
<b>Single-parent families are common.
It's not an issue.</b>

487
00:37:25,689 --> 00:37:27,476
<b>Yes. Who cares?</b>

488
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,735
<b>Oh, that's not what I meant.</b>

489
00:37:29,759 --> 00:37:32,370
<b>He works on a ship.</b>

490
00:37:32,769 --> 00:37:35,016
<b>Oh, he works on a ship.</b>

491
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,216
<b>That's nice. He's a captain.</b>

492
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:38,639
<b>It's not his ship.</b>

493
00:37:41,779 --> 00:37:43,826
<b>Who cares if it's not his ship?</b>

494
00:37:43,850 --> 00:37:45,925
<b>It's cool to be a sailor.</b>

495
00:37:45,949 --> 00:37:49,295
<b>He must have bronze skin.</b>

496
00:37:49,319 --> 00:37:52,826
<b>I always dreamed of
marrying a strong man.</b>

497
00:37:52,850 --> 00:37:53,836
<b>Yes.</b>

498
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:57,766
<b>He doesn't work right now.
His health deteriorated.</b>

499
00:37:57,790 --> 00:37:59,029
<b>Oh, dear.</b>

500
00:37:59,889 --> 00:38:02,636
<b>Oh, dear, he must be terribly sick.</b>

501
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:04,670
<b>The sailing took its toll.</b>

502
00:38:06,029 --> 00:38:07,740
<b>He's an alcoholic.</b>

503
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:10,610
<b>Alcohol...</b>

504
00:38:15,639 --> 00:38:17,279
<b>It was a joke.</b>

505
00:38:24,189 --> 00:38:25,649
<b>My goodness.</b>

506
00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:27,259
<b>That was funny.</b>

507
00:38:27,519 --> 00:38:30,829
<b>Your friend is quite witty.</b>

508
00:38:30,889 --> 00:38:32,136
<b>How is that funny?</b>

509
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:35,105
<b>My goodness. Alcoholism...</b>

510
00:38:35,129 --> 00:38:36,576
<b>Did I not get it?</b>

511
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:40,446
<b>Yes, so, she told a joke.</b>

512
00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:41,846
<b>That was funny.</b>

513
00:38:41,870 --> 00:38:43,870
<b>My gosh.</b>

514
00:38:45,769 --> 00:38:47,879
<b>Are you worried for your daughter?</b>

515
00:38:48,639 --> 00:38:50,925
<b>Guk Bong said he talked to her.</b>

516
00:38:50,949 --> 00:38:54,350
<b>I'm not waiting.
I'm getting some fresh air.</b>

517
00:38:54,949 --> 00:38:56,550
<b>It's cold. Go inside.</b>

518
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:57,750
<b>Okay.</b>

519
00:39:00,889 --> 00:39:02,860
<b>Where did you two go...</b>

520
00:39:04,589 --> 00:39:05,730
<b>A cat?</b>

521
00:39:05,959 --> 00:39:08,300
<b>Isn't that your cat, Sol Ah?</b>

522
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:11,000
<b>What happened?
I didn't see it earlier.</b>

523
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:16,670
<b>It was looking at the sea.
It likes to walk about on its own.</b>

524
00:39:17,939 --> 00:39:20,009
<b>You went to look for the cat?</b>

525
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:22,439
<b>Yes, kind of.</b>

526
00:39:38,329 --> 00:39:39,589
<b>Let him sleep.</b>

527
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:51,339
<b>You said he turns human
when he's near me.</b>

528
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:53,269
<b>He's a cat if he falls asleep.</b>

529
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,540
<b>And he can turn into a human again
once he sleeps.</b>

530
00:39:57,350 --> 00:39:59,149
<b>I guess you can say
his time is limited.</b>

531
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:05,850
<b>He said he had
something like narcolepsy.</b>

532
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:08,990
<b>So that's what he meant.</b>

533
00:40:10,959 --> 00:40:14,459
<b>My head is so jumbled up right now.</b>

534
00:40:15,629 --> 00:40:17,669
<b>Like all the pieces of a puzzle
are scattered about.</b>

535
00:40:18,029 --> 00:40:19,230
<b>Can we talk?</b>

536
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,139
<b>Do you know...</b>

537
00:40:24,370 --> 00:40:26,509
<b>when it is you first met Hong Jo?</b>

538
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:29,079
<b>What?</b>

539
00:40:30,709 --> 00:40:31,779
<b>It was...</b>

540
00:40:32,579 --> 00:40:35,079
<b>when your ex-girlfriend brought him
when you opened your cafe.</b>

541
00:40:41,759 --> 00:40:42,990
<b>Come to think of it...</b>

542
00:40:43,930 --> 00:40:45,230
<b>You weren't aware of it,</b>

543
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:48,259
<b>but the kitten you abandoned...</b>

544
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:50,629
<b>was Hong Jo.</b>

545
00:40:50,829 --> 00:40:53,000
<b>You must've seen wrong.</b>

546
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,500
<b>I wrapped this scarf
around a little boy.</b>

547
00:40:56,169 --> 00:40:59,070
<b>I first saw you
somewhere around here.</b>

548
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:01,309
<b>Why aren't you saying anything?</b>

549
00:41:01,610 --> 00:41:04,009
<b>Will you make a sound
if I press a button? Beep.</b>

550
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:05,909
<b>Why aren't you saying anything?</b>

551
00:41:06,450 --> 00:41:08,090
<b>Will you make a sound
if I press a button?</b>

552
00:41:09,049 --> 00:41:10,490
<b>That boy was...</b>

553
00:41:11,789 --> 00:41:13,120
<b>Hong Jo?</b>

554
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:16,720
<b>Yes.</b>

555
00:41:19,029 --> 00:41:20,759
<b>I looked everywhere for him.</b>

556
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:23,100
<b>That's why I misunderstood you.</b>

557
00:41:23,799 --> 00:41:25,629
<b>How could something like this
happen?</b>

558
00:41:31,039 --> 00:41:32,210
<b>I know it's late,</b>

559
00:41:34,210 --> 00:41:35,450
<b>but I want to turn things back.</b>

560
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:42,149
<b>This way.</b>

561
00:41:44,490 --> 00:41:47,320
<b>- Good night.
- Thank you for the meal.</b>

562
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:49,096
<b>- Good night.
- Bye.</b>

563
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:51,190
<b>- Good night.
- Let's go inside.</b>

564
00:41:52,889 --> 00:41:54,860
<b>- You can go in first.
- What about you?</b>

565
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:57,806
<b>What? You'll walk her up
to her home upstairs?</b>

566
00:41:57,830 --> 00:41:59,269
<b>Mind your own business.</b>

567
00:41:59,429 --> 00:42:00,645
<b>- But...
- Just go inside!</b>

568
00:42:00,669 --> 00:42:02,109
<b>Are you going to follow her
upstairs?</b>

569
00:42:03,639 --> 00:42:05,409
<b>- But he's...
- I'm sorry.</b>

570
00:42:05,769 --> 00:42:08,409
<b>They think asking questions
is a way of being friendly.</b>

571
00:42:08,509 --> 00:42:09,586
<b>I know.</b>

572
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:12,480
<b>They're nice people,
but I was too shy.</b>

573
00:42:18,419 --> 00:42:19,590
<b>Do you have an upset stomach?</b>

574
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:24,259
<b>I know a very effective
digestive medicine.</b>

575
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:35,240
<b>We weren't going to the pharmacy?</b>

576
00:42:37,870 --> 00:42:40,480
<b>Don't you know coin karaoke
is the best when you feel sick?</b>

577
00:42:40,639 --> 00:42:42,759
<b>It's way better than
poking your finger with a needle.</b>

578
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:44,926
<b>I just want to go home...</b>

579
00:42:44,950 --> 00:42:47,320
<b>All right. Instead of singing...</b>

580
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:50,279
<b>How about that?</b>

581
00:42:50,419 --> 00:42:52,466
<b>- I just have to kill that thing.
- Really?</b>

582
00:42:52,490 --> 00:42:55,159
<b>Why don't you shout out loud
for a change?</b>

583
00:43:15,509 --> 00:43:17,309
<b>(Bodyguards are up front.
We are outnumbered.)</b>

584
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:30,360
<b>(Stage 1 Score)</b>

585
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:01,690
<b>I just wanted to...</b>

586
00:44:01,990 --> 00:44:03,759
<b>break the wall between us
and become friends.</b>

587
00:44:10,970 --> 00:44:12,570
<b>I heard that often.</b>

588
00:44:14,799 --> 00:44:15,970
<b>"Break the wall."</b>

589
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:19,139
<b>"Come out of your shell."</b>

590
00:44:21,110 --> 00:44:22,509
<b>I was scolded all the time.</b>

591
00:44:25,210 --> 00:44:27,650
<b>Someone asked me if I had
a bad childhood memory or something.</b>

592
00:44:29,279 --> 00:44:31,090
<b>I don't have a particular trauma.</b>

593
00:44:33,250 --> 00:44:34,720
<b>I'm just always like this.</b>

594
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:39,960
<b>This is who I am.</b>

595
00:44:45,269 --> 00:44:46,500
<b>That was inconsiderate of me.</b>

596
00:44:47,870 --> 00:44:51,070
<b>It's just because you barely spoke,</b>

597
00:44:53,070 --> 00:44:54,779
<b>so I wanted to make you
talk to me.</b>

598
00:44:57,409 --> 00:45:00,879
<b>I just did it to hear your voice
at least.</b>

599
00:45:05,950 --> 00:45:07,690
<b>If you want to talk,</b>

600
00:45:09,620 --> 00:45:10,830
<b>let's talk.</b>

601
00:45:13,090 --> 00:45:14,259
<b>Someplace quiet.</b>

602
00:45:14,899 --> 00:45:16,035
<b>I know you wanted to talk,</b>

603
00:45:16,059 --> 00:45:18,405
<b>but how could you bring me
to a library?</b>

604
00:45:18,429 --> 00:45:20,399
<b>There are a lot of other
quiet places.</b>

605
00:45:25,009 --> 00:45:27,240
<b>Who's stupid enough
to make noise at a library?</b>

606
00:45:30,809 --> 00:45:32,210
<b>You don't want to talk with me?</b>

607
00:45:32,779 --> 00:45:33,950
<b>- No...
- Why?</b>

608
00:45:34,250 --> 00:45:35,930
<b>Are you disappointed
now that we've talked?</b>

609
00:45:36,279 --> 00:45:38,359
<b>Because we have different tastes
and I talk too much?</b>

610
00:45:39,519 --> 00:45:42,590
<b>I'm right.
I catch on easily, you know.</b>

611
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:44,029
<b>That's not true.</b>

612
00:45:45,190 --> 00:45:46,289
<b>There...</b>

613
00:45:52,870 --> 00:45:55,539
<b>Ji Eun. I'm usually quick-witted,</b>

614
00:45:55,740 --> 00:45:58,840
<b>but I was so frustrated and
was just venting.</b>

615
00:45:59,409 --> 00:46:00,470
<b>Ji Eun.</b>

616
00:46:02,509 --> 00:46:05,409
<b>I mean it.
I'm really a quick-witted guy.</b>

617
00:46:11,789 --> 00:46:14,490
<b>Doo Sik, you're slow-witted.</b>

618
00:46:16,559 --> 00:46:18,259
<b>No matter how much I stared at you,</b>

619
00:46:19,190 --> 00:46:20,429
<b>you didn't know.</b>

620
00:46:22,659 --> 00:46:23,730
<b>That's...</b>

621
00:46:25,870 --> 00:46:27,399
<b>That's why I like you.</b>

622
00:46:30,539 --> 00:46:32,139
<b>You're slow-witted...</b>

623
00:46:36,039 --> 00:46:37,750
<b>and it makes you seem more sincere.</b>

624
00:46:50,190 --> 00:46:51,830
<b>Hey, what is...</b>

625
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:53,529
<b>What's wrong with this?</b>

626
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:57,470
<b>What's wrong? Is your coin stuck?</b>

627
00:46:58,500 --> 00:46:59,500
<b>Hey.</b>

628
00:47:00,399 --> 00:47:02,370
<b>Spit it out. Come on!</b>

629
00:47:06,539 --> 00:47:07,779
<b>I got one for free.</b>

630
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:31,269
<b>Thank... Thank you.</b>

631
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:41,240
<b>You don't remember, do you?</b>

632
00:47:48,279 --> 00:47:50,450
<b>You probably didn't even know
who I was.</b>

633
00:47:52,590 --> 00:47:54,796
<b>You didn't have to be nice to me,
but you were.</b>

634
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:56,059
<b>So I felt more thankful.</b>

635
00:47:57,389 --> 00:47:59,389
<b>It wasn't because you were
thinking of my feelings,</b>

636
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:02,600
<b>but because you truly meant it.</b>

637
00:48:06,169 --> 00:48:07,230
<b>So...</b>

638
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:12,039
<b>just keep being slow-witted.</b>

639
00:48:17,379 --> 00:48:19,009
<b>There's something I didn't tell you.</b>

640
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:23,450
<b>What is it?</b>

641
00:48:25,750 --> 00:48:27,389
<b>Are you a cat too or something?</b>

642
00:48:31,429 --> 00:48:32,629
<b>I was...</b>

643
00:48:33,659 --> 00:48:36,029
<b>abandoned like a cat too.</b>

644
00:48:50,950 --> 00:48:52,155
<b>(I'm sorry.)</b>

645
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:53,659
<b>This was the only thing
that was left.</b>

646
00:48:57,789 --> 00:48:59,919
<b>Just like when people
abandon their pets,</b>

647
00:49:01,019 --> 00:49:02,459
<b>I was abandoned somewhere
far away...</b>

648
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:04,889
<b>at an unfamiliar place...</b>

649
00:49:06,159 --> 00:49:07,600
<b>so I would never find them.</b>

650
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:13,180
<b>I wanted to find out
who my parents were...</b>

651
00:49:14,539 --> 00:49:15,940
<b>but it was impossible to find them.</b>

652
00:49:17,909 --> 00:49:20,109
<b>They shouldn't have done that
if they were really sorry.</b>

653
00:49:22,340 --> 00:49:23,539
<b>They should've given me...</b>

654
00:49:24,650 --> 00:49:26,579
<b>a chance to do something at least.</b>

655
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:32,250
<b>Whether it's to resent or forgive.</b>

656
00:49:33,589 --> 00:49:35,519
<b>What I really can't forgive...</b>

657
00:49:37,990 --> 00:49:40,329
<b>is that I wasn't given a chance to.</b>

658
00:49:51,069 --> 00:49:53,339
<b>You're giving me
that sad look already?</b>

659
00:49:55,279 --> 00:49:58,950
<b>That was the 1st of 4 stories
of how I was abandoned.</b>

660
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:06,789
<b>My current parents are
my fourth adoptive parents.</b>

661
00:50:07,519 --> 00:50:09,220
<b>I was abandoned once,</b>

662
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:11,529
<b>and it kept happening.</b>

663
00:50:13,789 --> 00:50:15,500
<b>People must think...</b>

664
00:50:16,630 --> 00:50:18,700
<b>because it happened once,
it's okay to do it again.</b>

665
00:50:20,569 --> 00:50:21,799
<b>On a snowy day,</b>

666
00:50:25,069 --> 00:50:28,240
<b>the kitten I found
on a heap of trash...</b>

667
00:50:31,250 --> 00:50:32,680
<b>remained me of myself.</b>

668
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:36,880
<b>I was afraid...</b>

669
00:50:38,650 --> 00:50:41,859
<b>you would abandon me like that.</b>

670
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:45,960
<b>I had no idea.</b>

671
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:50,630
<b>I said it was
your excuse to run away.</b>

672
00:50:53,670 --> 00:50:55,640
<b>I spoke too rashly.</b>

673
00:50:58,470 --> 00:50:59,740
<b>You were right.</b>

674
00:51:02,039 --> 00:51:04,180
<b>I was ashamed to tell you this.</b>

675
00:51:05,009 --> 00:51:06,410
<b>You shouldn't have been.</b>

676
00:51:07,819 --> 00:51:09,579
<b>You were just a child.</b>

677
00:51:11,089 --> 00:51:12,119
<b>Hong Jo...</b>

678
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:15,160
<b>was just a kitten.</b>

679
00:51:16,990 --> 00:51:19,190
<b>He made me feel even worse.</b>

680
00:51:20,190 --> 00:51:22,130
<b>We were both abandoned,</b>

681
00:51:23,930 --> 00:51:26,400
<b>but he chose to stay with you,</b>

682
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:30,039
<b>and I ran away.</b>

683
00:51:31,339 --> 00:51:32,569
<b>Now I look back...</b>

684
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:36,079
<b>and see that...</b>

685
00:51:37,279 --> 00:51:40,109
<b>our warm memories outnumber
my sad ones of being abandoned.</b>

686
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:51,289
<b>That cat...</b>

687
00:51:51,829 --> 00:51:53,789
<b>stayed with me all night.</b>

688
00:51:54,299 --> 00:51:55,859
<b>That's how I survived.</b>

689
00:51:58,569 --> 00:52:00,099
<b>What a sweet thing.</b>

690
00:52:04,970 --> 00:52:06,269
<b>You were the same.</b>

691
00:52:09,779 --> 00:52:10,980
<b>Now...</b>

692
00:52:13,250 --> 00:52:15,049
<b>I'll stay by your side.</b>

693
00:52:19,890 --> 00:52:21,759
<b>I'm not asking you to accept me.</b>

694
00:52:22,289 --> 00:52:23,319
<b>I just...</b>

695
00:52:24,789 --> 00:52:26,559
<b>want you to know that...</b>

696
00:52:27,660 --> 00:52:29,099
<b>I'm by your side.</b>

697
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,369
<b>If that makes you feel
just a little warmer,</b>

698
00:52:36,170 --> 00:52:37,400
<b>that's enough for me.</b>

699
00:52:58,160 --> 00:52:59,160
<b>(Media)</b>

700
00:53:06,930 --> 00:53:08,500
<b>Did I ask you to keep looking at me?</b>

701
00:53:11,609 --> 00:53:14,339
<b>You're around me
at work and at home.</b>

702
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:22,480
<b>If someone keeps looking at me,
of course I'd feel bothered.</b>

703
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:26,396
<b>Okay. I get your point.</b>

704
00:53:26,420 --> 00:53:28,589
<b>I get it. I'll...</b>

705
00:53:34,700 --> 00:53:36,906
<b>(So now I'll look at you as well.)</b>

706
00:53:36,930 --> 00:53:40,106
<b>So now I'll look at you as well.</b>

707
00:53:40,130 --> 00:53:43,775
<b>What... What do you mean?</b>

708
00:53:43,799 --> 00:53:45,569
<b>I'm not checking things out.</b>

709
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:47,839
<b>I'll look because I want to.</b>

710
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:51,880
<b>What?</b>

711
00:53:53,509 --> 00:53:54,519
<b>Why?</b>

712
00:53:54,579 --> 00:53:56,119
<b>I just want to.</b>

713
00:53:56,619 --> 00:53:59,220
<b>I want to see you
chew your mackerel.</b>

714
00:54:00,549 --> 00:54:03,490
<b>And I want to see you
shoot in the gaming arcade.</b>

715
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:06,890
<b>You look like a pill bug
when you slouch on your desk.</b>

716
00:54:08,829 --> 00:54:09,806
<b>It's cute.</b>

717
00:54:09,830 --> 00:54:11,230
<b>No way.</b>

718
00:54:21,140 --> 00:54:24,549
<b>A library is a nice place
to talk in.</b>

719
00:54:25,180 --> 00:54:27,509
<b>Your voice echoes.</b>

720
00:54:31,190 --> 00:54:32,250
<b>Let's go outside.</b>

721
00:54:56,279 --> 00:54:58,255
<b>We don't need to do this.</b>

722
00:54:58,279 --> 00:54:59,380
<b>Come on.</b>

723
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:04,619
<b>It would've been nice
if Guk Bong were here too.</b>

724
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:06,426
<b>Did he go somewhere?</b>

725
00:55:06,450 --> 00:55:08,565
<b>He left again like the wind.</b>

726
00:55:08,589 --> 00:55:11,430
<b>He seems to love
the Uyuni salt flats.</b>

727
00:55:11,490 --> 00:55:13,029
<b>He's going back there again.</b>

728
00:55:14,930 --> 00:55:16,900
<b>He really is going there.</b>

729
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:20,845
<b>He left a huge birthday gift.</b>

730
00:55:20,869 --> 00:55:23,245
<b>Did you see the computer
in your room?</b>

731
00:55:23,269 --> 00:55:24,299
<b>Yes.</b>

732
00:55:24,670 --> 00:55:27,710
<b>So your father can see
your webtoon on a large monitor.</b>

733
00:55:28,410 --> 00:55:30,315
<b>My webtoon?</b>

734
00:55:30,339 --> 00:55:31,480
<b>Oh, dear.</b>

735
00:55:31,779 --> 00:55:33,656
<b>He told me not to mention it.</b>

736
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:35,626
<b>Dad. Did you read my webtoon?</b>

737
00:55:35,650 --> 00:55:36,750
<b>How did you find out?</b>

738
00:55:38,690 --> 00:55:39,920
<b>It was...</b>

739
00:55:41,490 --> 00:55:43,420
<b>the guy with the smiley eyes.</b>

740
00:55:44,630 --> 00:55:46,535
<b>- Ko Doo Sik?
- Yes.</b>

741
00:55:46,559 --> 00:55:48,799
<b>When did he get your number?</b>

742
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,575
<b>Don't read it. I get so many...</b>

743
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:52,676
<b>negative comments.</b>

744
00:55:52,700 --> 00:55:55,616
<b>He leaves a lot of comments himself.</b>

745
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:58,109
<b>"Fun", "great fun", "the best fun".</b>

746
00:55:58,170 --> 00:56:00,245
<b>When did I do that?</b>

747
00:56:00,269 --> 00:56:01,279
<b>What?</b>

748
00:56:01,779 --> 00:56:05,255
<b>I thought it was a pre-teen kid
and considered him my only fan.</b>

749
00:56:05,279 --> 00:56:08,650
<b>That pre-teen kid was you, Dad?</b>

750
00:56:09,450 --> 00:56:10,680
<b>It wasn't me.</b>

751
00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:12,325
<b>Oh, come on.</b>

752
00:56:12,349 --> 00:56:15,265
<b>Did you have to write something
that sounded so childish?</b>

753
00:56:15,289 --> 00:56:17,690
<b>Seriously. My gosh.</b>

754
00:56:20,529 --> 00:56:21,730
<b>Was that funny?</b>

755
00:56:22,230 --> 00:56:23,599
<b>No, sir.</b>

756
00:56:25,730 --> 00:56:27,940
<b>Why are you sitting there
if it's not funny?</b>

757
00:56:29,069 --> 00:56:31,686
<b>Will you stop it, Mr. Kim?</b>

758
00:56:31,710 --> 00:56:35,480
<b>Jae Seon bought us
Grade A Korean beef.</b>

759
00:56:36,980 --> 00:56:38,750
<b>Is it time for my medication?</b>

760
00:56:39,180 --> 00:56:40,750
<b>I have high cholesterol levels.</b>

761
00:56:40,779 --> 00:56:43,356
<b>Oh, high cholesterol levels...</b>

762
00:56:43,380 --> 00:56:46,166
<b>Then I shouldn't have bought beef.</b>

763
00:56:46,190 --> 00:56:48,636
<b>I apologize. I didn't know.</b>

764
00:56:48,660 --> 00:56:50,519
<b>- Oh, dear.
- Next time,</b>

765
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:52,166
<b>I'll get something else.</b>

766
00:56:52,190 --> 00:56:54,559
<b>He looks like he's about to cry.</b>

767
00:56:54,700 --> 00:56:55,900
<b>Don't cry.</b>

768
00:56:58,299 --> 00:57:00,400
<b>- Was he kidding?
- Yes. My goodness.</b>

769
00:57:00,470 --> 00:57:03,616
<b>- Happy birthday to you
- Happy birthday to you</b>

770
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:06,745
<b>- Happy birthday to you
- Happy birthday to you</b>

771
00:57:06,769 --> 00:57:10,410
<b>- Happy birthday, dear Mr. Kim
- Happy birthday, dear Dad</b>

772
00:57:10,609 --> 00:57:13,410
<b>- Happy birthday to you
- Happy birthday to you</b>

773
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:20,990
<b>Make a wish.</b>

774
00:58:15,710 --> 00:58:17,240
<b>What were you doing?</b>

775
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:23,380
<b>I just listened.</b>

776
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:27,390
<b>To the laughter and the singing.</b>

777
00:58:29,190 --> 00:58:30,420
<b>It sounded nice.</b>

778
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:38,269
<b>Did you hide like this all along?</b>

779
00:58:41,769 --> 00:58:44,299
<b>I found it strange you knew me well.</b>

780
00:58:46,410 --> 00:58:48,680
<b>You were watching me all along.</b>

781
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:54,750
<b>The day we first met.</b>

782
00:58:57,619 --> 00:58:59,819
<b>You said that day felt like a dream.</b>

783
00:59:05,089 --> 00:59:07,130
<b>I remember that day clearly.</b>

784
00:59:09,730 --> 00:59:12,299
<b>I brought a lost kid home,</b>

00:59:13,529 --> 00:59:16,299
<b>but he suddenly disappeared
and I looked for him.</b>

786
00:59:19,509 --> 00:59:22,180
<b>"What happened to that little boy?"</b>

787
00:59:24,279 --> 00:59:26,549
<b>I thought about him
every now and then...</b>

788
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:28,950
<b>and got worried.</b>

789
00:59:31,690 --> 00:59:32,720
<b>But...</b>

790
00:59:35,089 --> 00:59:37,119
<b>he was right next to me.</b>

791
00:59:39,329 --> 00:59:41,130
<b>And a grown adult too.</b>

792
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:07,750
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

793
01:00:12,829 --> 01:00:15,359
<b>I just don't know...</b>

794
01:00:18,700 --> 01:00:20,799
<b>how to accept you.</b>

795
01:00:27,710 --> 01:00:30,009
<b>My cat Hong Jo...</b>

796
01:00:33,210 --> 01:00:35,019
<b>and the guy I liked.</b>

797
01:00:38,519 --> 01:00:41,150
<b>They both suddenly feel
so unfamiliar.</b>

798
01:00:47,559 --> 01:00:49,630
<b>Can you give me some time?</b>

799
01:01:00,170 --> 01:01:01,240
<b>Sol Ah.</b>

800
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:02,940
<b>Dad.</b>

801
01:01:06,250 --> 01:01:07,450
<b>Who were you talking to?</b>

802
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:11,849
<b>I was on the phone.</b>

803
01:01:12,450 --> 01:01:13,789
<b>Why are you out here?</b>

804
01:01:17,559 --> 01:01:19,690
<b>I felt hot and needed some air.</b>

805
01:01:21,029 --> 01:01:22,200
<b>It's cold.</b>

806
01:01:28,569 --> 01:01:29,900
<b>My gosh.</b>

807
01:01:34,170 --> 01:01:35,210
<b>Thanks.</b>

808
01:01:37,579 --> 01:01:39,079
<b>That wasn't from me.</b>

809
01:01:40,279 --> 01:01:41,279
<b>From whom, then?</b>

810
01:01:44,519 --> 01:01:45,549
<b>A cat.</b>

811
01:01:46,619 --> 01:01:47,650
<b>What?</b>

812
01:01:55,630 --> 01:01:56,660
<b>Dad.</b>

813
01:01:58,630 --> 01:02:00,299
<b>Will you listen to my story?</b>

814
01:02:02,539 --> 01:02:03,569
<b>What is it?</b>

815
01:02:16,220 --> 01:02:17,650
<b>A cat...</b>

816
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:24,119
<b>A cat...</b>

817
01:02:26,890 --> 01:02:28,599
<b>You don't need to tell me.</b>

818
01:02:29,630 --> 01:02:31,200
<b>You want me to keep it?</b>

819
01:02:33,099 --> 01:02:36,099
<b>Why did you adopt
an animal you can't handle?</b>

820
01:02:37,940 --> 01:02:39,240
<b>Are you bored of it already?</b>

821
01:02:40,670 --> 01:02:43,180
<b>No, it's not like that.</b>

822
01:02:47,609 --> 01:02:48,819
<b>I like it.</b>

823
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:53,690
<b>I really like it.</b>

824
01:02:55,890 --> 01:02:56,960
<b>Leave it here.</b>

825
01:02:57,490 --> 01:02:59,136
<b>You can't keep a pet...</b>

826
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:01,259
<b>when you live alone
and work all day.</b>

827
01:03:02,529 --> 01:03:04,930
<b>And you can't travel freely either.</b>

828
01:03:06,500 --> 01:03:10,369
<b>I'm sure this place is
much better for the cat too.</b>

829
01:03:13,109 --> 01:03:15,880
<b>Don't let something like a cat
tie you down.</b>

830
01:03:17,180 --> 01:03:18,880
<b>Leave it here and
get on with your life.</b>

831
01:03:55,349 --> 01:03:58,196
<b>(Welcome)</b>

832
01:03:58,220 --> 01:04:01,495
<b>I was next to you
even when I didn't know it.</b>

833
01:04:01,519 --> 01:04:04,636
<b>Such a relationship isn't easy
for a person or a cat.</b>

834
01:04:04,660 --> 01:04:06,706
<b>Sol Ah needs some time.</b>

835
01:04:06,730 --> 01:04:08,799
<b>You said he sat here and cried.</b>

836
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:10,059
<b>Are you sick?</b>

837
01:04:11,660 --> 01:04:14,446
<b>- What is it?
- I want to apologize to you.</b>

838
01:04:14,470 --> 01:04:15,900
<b>I'll stay next to you.</b>

839
01:04:16,269 --> 01:04:18,910
<b>Even if our fate is sealed, I'll go.</b>

840
01:04:19,740 --> 01:04:22,880
<b>It's my choice to do
everything for you before I leave.</b>
