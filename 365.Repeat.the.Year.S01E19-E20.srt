<b>Don't they look familiar?</b>

<b>Did you think I was Hyeong Ju?</b>

<b>You finally found out who it was.</b>

<b>Hey, have you had lunch?</b>

19
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:49,860
<b>- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.</b>

20
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,830
<b>This is a video
recently uploaded on social media.</b>

<b>Ko Seok Gyu,
the Minister of Education nominee...</b>

24

<b>just resigned from the campaign.</b>

25
00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:07,385
<b>I truly apologize once again

26

<b>Justice prevails in the end.</b>

27
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:12,156
<b>- Hey, Sun Ho.
- Negative reactions of the video...</b>

28
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:14,265
<b>- led to the resignation of...
- When is Ko's questioning?</b>

29
00:04:14,289 --> 00:04:15,825
<b>This Friday. Why?</b>

30
00:04:15,849 --> 00:04:18,195
<b>- Ko held a press conference...
- Just because.</b>

31
00:04:18,219 --> 00:04:19,596
<b>- At his house.
- I'm not sure if Ko Seok Gyu...</b>

32
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,365
<b>will cooperate in this situation.</b>

33
00:04:21,389 --> 00:04:23,505
<b>We have to make them do it.
That's why we're detectives.</b>

34
00:04:23,529 --> 00:04:24,730
<b>Don't worry.</b>

35
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,500
<b>I'll take care of everything.</b>

36
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,375
<b>There was a total of
four detectives...</b>

37
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:31,559
<b>who visited Bae Jung Tae in prison
including Hyeong Ju.</b>

38
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:32,745
<b>He has three previous charges,</b>

39
00:04:32,769 --> 00:04:34,386
<b>and he was released
with a warning a few times,</b>

40
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:36,185
<b>so a total of six detectives
wrote an affidavit on him.</b>

41
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:38,386
<b>If we make it obvious that
we're checking their alibis,</b>

42
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:39,779
<b>they'll only get hostile.</b>

43
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:41,625
<b>Make sure our information
doesn't get leaked out.</b>

44
00:04:41,649 --> 00:04:43,726
<b>Find out their alibis
in the most discreet way possible.</b>

45
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,079
<b>- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.</b>

46
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:46,726
<b>What about that burner phone
Hyeong Ju found?</b>

47
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,925
<b>I found the call history,</b>

48
00:04:48,949 --> 00:04:50,266
<b>and I requested the call history...</b>

49
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,466
<b>of the people whom he talked to
on the day of the incident.</b>

50
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:53,920
<b>Check if any of them are...</b>

51
00:04:54,189 --> 00:04:57,560
<b>connected to these detectives
as soon as you have the result.</b>

52
00:04:57,829 --> 00:05:00,576
<b>Soon Woo, find the pictures
of the said detectives...</b>

53
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,375
<b>before Ko Jae Young's questioning.</b>

54
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:03,800
<b>Yes, sir.</b>

55
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:07,269
<b>This is a list of detectives
who contacted Bae Jung Tae.</b>

56
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:10,315
<b>Are you sure
you can share this with me?</b>

57
00:05:10,339 --> 00:05:11,610
<b>I shouldn't.</b>

58
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:14,649
<b>But I trust you.</b>

59
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:16,410
<b>Look.</b>

60
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,750
<b>Do any of them look familiar?</b>

61
00:05:22,949 --> 00:05:25,889
<b>You may have passed them by
on your way to his house.</b>

62
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,665
<b>I'm not sure.</b>

63
00:05:27,689 --> 00:05:28,809
<b>(Police Officer Information)</b>

64
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:35,170
<b>Here's one thing
that I just don't understand.</b>

65
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:39,639
<b>If all the people who reset
their lives got murdered,</b>

66
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:42,310
<b>then how were they able
to turn back time?</b>

67
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,485
<b>(Kim Se Rin)</b>

68
00:05:45,509 --> 00:05:47,279
<b>So...</b>

69
00:05:47,779 --> 00:05:51,449
<b>she prevented them from dying
and did the reset?</b>

70
00:05:53,819 --> 00:05:55,990
<b>This isn't your webtoon's plot,
is it?</b>

71
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,689
<b>I wish it were.</b>

72
00:06:04,129 --> 00:06:06,536
<b>If he's the only one blabbering
about this, I'd ignore him.</b>

73
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,370
<b>But you're saying the same thing.</b>

74
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,199
<b>But still,</b>

75
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:15,509
<b>I don't think
this is serial killing.</b>

76
00:06:16,339 --> 00:06:18,040
<b>Is there a reason
you think that way?</b>

77
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:27,100
<b>These photos were found
at Bae Jung Tae's place.</b>

78
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:41,029
<b>How did he have them?</b>

79
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,029
<b>- Was he a witness?
- That's impossible.</b>

80
00:06:44,569 --> 00:06:47,670
<b>He had a solid alibi
during Cha Jeung Seok's death.</b>

81
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:49,709
<b>Then who took these?</b>

82
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:51,310
<b>I'm not sure.</b>

83
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,540
<b>It's either the murderer...</b>

84
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,920
<b>or someone who already knew
the murders would take place.</b>

85
00:06:57,579 --> 00:06:59,925
<b>What does the latter mean?</b>

86
00:06:59,949 --> 00:07:01,250
<b>It's Ms. Lee Shin.</b>

87
00:07:01,449 --> 00:07:03,165
<b>She's the only one who knows...</b>

88
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:05,620
<b>when and where we'll die.</b>

89
00:07:09,459 --> 00:07:12,459
<b>If she took these,</b>

90
00:07:13,629 --> 00:07:15,406
<b>that means she knows
who the killer is.</b>

91
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:18,800
<b>She said that Kim Se Rin's case
was unsolved.</b>

92
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:20,310
<b>Just like
the Maseong Serial Murders,</b>

93
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:22,509
<b>Perhaps, only the victims
were found.</b>

94
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:27,550
<b>But we can't trust her.</b>

95
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:42,370
<b>Why did you agree
to reset your life?</b>

96
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,959
<b>- What?
- Judging by this place,</b>

97
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,529
<b>I don't think it was for the money.</b>

98
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:51,675
<b>I thought it'd be fun.
I'd be able to catch the culprits,</b>

99
00:07:51,699 --> 00:07:53,740
<b>and I looked forward to teasing you.</b>

100
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:58,879
<b>But I had no idea I'd face
such a heinous murderer.</b>

101
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,459
<b>How was I?</b>

102
00:08:14,389 --> 00:08:16,430
<b>What do you think?
You were the same.</b>

103
00:08:22,329 --> 00:08:23,769
<b>Were we still partners?</b>

104
00:08:26,569 --> 00:08:29,470
<b>Of course.
Who else would put up with you?</b>

105
00:08:30,939 --> 00:08:32,755
<b>I guess I was still a detective.</b>

106
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:35,209
<b>You're only good
at being a detective.</b>

107
00:08:35,779 --> 00:08:38,250
<b>Did I get a special promotion?</b>

108
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:41,289
<b>You? A special promotion?</b>

109
00:08:42,649 --> 00:08:45,035
<b>Oh, please. Don't be ridiculous.</b>

110
00:08:45,059 --> 00:08:48,259
<b>You could catch this killer with me
and get that promotion if you want.</b>

111
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:50,690
<b>- Okay?
- Deal.</b>

112
00:08:52,129 --> 00:08:53,230
<b>Okay.</b>

113
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,639
<b>Soon Woo, let's give them out today.</b>

114
00:09:08,049 --> 00:09:10,549
<b>Shouldn't we solve this case first?</b>

115
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,649
<b>Everyone's stressed out about it.</b>

116
00:09:14,389 --> 00:09:17,090
<b>Fine. If we fail to catch the killer
and the case becomes unsolved,</b>

117
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:19,030
<b>we can leave our relationship
unsolved as well.</b>

118
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:20,659
<b>That shouldn't happen.</b>

119
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:23,330
<b>You shouldn't leave
your lives unsolved.</b>

120
00:09:25,029 --> 00:09:26,860
<b>- Soon Woo, let's work hard.
- Yes, ma'am.</b>

121
00:09:27,429 --> 00:09:29,005
<b>- Give it to me.
- Give what?</b>

122
00:09:29,029 --> 00:09:30,200
<b>The wedding invitation.</b>

123
00:09:31,769 --> 00:09:32,870
<b>How did you know?</b>

124
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:34,340
<b>Don't be shy, now.</b>

125
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:37,710
<b>January 12 at 12 p.m., right?</b>

126
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:39,879
<b>Give it to me.</b>

127
00:09:40,909 --> 00:09:43,679
<b>Sa Kyung, I promise to be there
this time.</b>

128
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:46,549
<b>What's with him?</b>

129
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,289
<b>He's so annoying.</b>

130
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,830
<b>Sa Kyung, were you married before?</b>

131
00:09:54,889 --> 00:09:56,360
<b>What are you talking about?</b>

132
00:09:58,659 --> 00:10:00,529
<b>I can understand!</b>

133
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:03,370
<b>Sa Kyung!</b>

134
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:08,110
<b>We expected that number
for our first test.</b>

135
00:10:08,809 --> 00:10:10,740
<b>That's not a bad result.</b>

136
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,539
<b>We'll do a checkup once again
before the next clinical test.</b>

137
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:22,190
<b>I'd like her
to finish her test here.</b>

138
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,250
<b>Would that be possible?</b>

139
00:10:25,659 --> 00:10:29,190
<b>As long as the schedule fits,
I don't see a problem with that.</b>

140
00:10:30,659 --> 00:10:31,960
<b>I'll ask.</b>

141
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:33,659
<b>Thanks.</b>

142
00:10:43,909 --> 00:10:46,279
<b>She'll be back as soon
as her meeting ends.</b>

143
00:10:49,909 --> 00:10:51,179
<b>Have you been well?</b>

144
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:58,120
<b>Young.</b>

145
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:28,365
<b>On the day of Bae Jung Tae's death,</b>

146
00:11:28,389 --> 00:11:31,919
<b>he was on the burner phone
four times.</b>

147
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,529
<b>One of them was his sister,
Ms. Bae Jung Hee.</b>

148
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,990
<b>The other three were burner phones.</b>

149
00:11:37,629 --> 00:11:38,830
<b>And they're all off.</b>

150
00:11:41,929 --> 00:11:43,600
<b>We can track
where they were turned off.</b>

151
00:11:43,899 --> 00:11:46,459
<b>Do any of the locations overlap
with the detectives on that list?</b>

152
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:49,110
<b>For now, no.</b>

153
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:52,615
<b>Since this is
circumstantial evidence,</b>

154
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,779

00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:34,976
<b>but he refused and ran away.</b>

310
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,045
<b>What did the forensics say?</b>

311
00:25:36,069 --> 00:25:37,646
<b>They have to conduct
a postmortem exam on him,</b>

312
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:39,970
<b>but it looks like he died
well over two days ago.</b>

313

<b>I'm sure he had been looking for

<b>Who are you?</b>

<b>Come in. Please move aside.</b>

318
00:25:56,349 --> 00:25:57,366
<b>One second.</b>

319
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:58,759
<b>One second, let me take a look.</b>

320
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,220
<b>They found his vehicle.</b>

321
00:26:35,119 --> 00:26:36,430
<b>The suspect got away.</b>

322
00:26:50,369 --> 00:26:51,485
<b>I can't believe this.</b>

323
00:26:51,509 --> 00:26:53,349
<b>The proof found on the scene
is pretty evident,</b>

324
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:55,450
<b>so it'll take some time
to investigate.</b>

325
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:04,450
<b>Do you also think
Hyeong Ju is the culprit?</b>

326
00:27:04,849 --> 00:27:06,190
<b>No.</b>

327
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,690
<b>I trust him
no matter what anyone says.</b>

328
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:14,660
<b>Hyeong Ju said...</b>

329
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:17,829
<b>the culprit seems like
someone who knows him.</b>

330
00:27:20,339 --> 00:27:21,799
<b>And I think so too.</b>

331
00:27:21,869 --> 00:27:25,680
<b>I'm sure he used
Ko Jae Young to lure him there.</b>

332
00:27:28,309 --> 00:27:29,650
<b>That means...</b>

333
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,119
<b>it has to be someone
who knows their relationship.</b>

334
00:27:37,049 --> 00:27:38,765
<b>I have to go see Ms. Lee Shin.</b>

335
00:27:38,789 --> 00:27:39,789
<b>I'll go.</b>

336
00:27:41,019 --> 00:27:42,829

<b>May I ask why you're here?</b>

347

<b>I came to ask you a few questions

<b>Kim Se Rin,

350
00:28:51,059 --> 00:28:52,136
<b>Yes.</b>

351

352
00:28:55,930 --> 00:28:58,529
<b>- Yes.
- The only thing...</b>

<b>Detective Ji is a murderer?</b>

363

<b>What's more important is

364

<b>That's why I've been investigating.</b>

365

<b>because of my pure suspicion.</b>

370
00:30:04,299 --> 00:30:06,970
<b>That means there is someone

371
00:30:10,269 --> 00:30:11,339

372

<b>Sir, Ko Jae Young had gone missing
three days ago.</b>

374
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:33,935

<b>Darn it.
I don't know what he's thinking.</b>

379
00:30:43,769 --> 00:30:44,785
<b>We should've reported this...</b>

380

<b>to the internal inspectors
during Bae Jung Tae's case.</b>

<b>Look what happened to him

382
00:30:49,179 --> 00:30:52,179
<b>But Corporal Ji doesn't have
any motive to kill Ko Jae Young.</b>

383
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:54,355
<b>He had to wait until the hypnosis
to reveal the real culprit,</b>

384
00:30:54,379 --> 00:30:55,796
<b>so he could clear his suspicion
about the recording file.</b>

385
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:57,166
<b>He could have killed the victim...</b>

386
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:58,526
<b>because he was scared
that he would be exposed.</b>

- I'm frustrated too.</b>

<b>Shouldn't he at least call us?</b>

389
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,280
<b>We need to know what's going on

<b>I see. Right.</b>

619
00:51:13,930 --> 00:51:16,315
<b>It's hard to recognize someone

620
00:51:16,339 --> 00:51:17,940
<b>We rarely get a lead that way.</b>

621

<b>Don't let it discourage you.</b>

622
00:51:19,309 --> 00:51:21,386
<b>Okay. I'll call you again.</b>

623
00:51:21,410 --> 00:51:23,216
<b>Go home before it gets dark.</b>

624
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:24,849
<b>Okay. I will.</b>

00:51:58,849 --> 00:52:00,150
<b>Did something happen?</b>

<b>I found out who he is.</b>

<b>Who is it?</b>

633
00:52:20,170 --> 00:52:21,569
<b>It's Detective Park.</b>

<b>Sun Ho?</b>

635
00:52:23,569 --> 00:52:25,109
<b>What are you talking about?</b>

636
00:52:25,710 --> 00:52:27,710
<b>On the day he came to the school...</b>

637

<b>He was on crutches.</b>

638

<b>The detective was on crutches.</b>

639
00:52:33,849 --> 00:52:35,650

<b>Hold on, Ga Hyeon.</b>

643
00:52:43,089 --> 00:52:45,589
<b>This is an awful joke you're making.</b>

<b>Young Woong's teacher...</b>

<b>I'm sure of it.
It was this detective.</b>

647

<b>- Let's go.
- Three.</b>

648
00:53:02,839 --> 00:53:05,349
<b>Let's take 1 more. 1, 2, 3.</b>

649
00:53:06,950 --> 00:53:08,595
<b>- Did you get it?
- Hyeong Ju,</b>

650
00:53:08,619 --> 00:53:10,325
<b>can you smile a bit?</b>

651
00:53:10,349 --> 00:53:12,089
<b>Yes. Why are you so grumpy?</b>

652
00:53:12,519 --> 00:53:15,095
<b>- Look at him pretending to be cool.
- You need to show this.</b>

653
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:16,166
<b>- The autograph?
- Yes.</b>

654
00:53:16,190 --> 00:53:17,366
<b>Let's take another one.</b>

655
00:53:17,390 --> 00:53:18,835
<b>- All right.
- Smile.</b>

656
00:53:18,859 --> 00:53:20,265
<b>Okay. Smile.</b>

657
00:53:20,289 --> 00:53:22,305
<b>In 1, 2, 3.</b>

658
00:53:22,329 --> 00:53:23,529
<b>That was great.</b>

659
00:53:26,329 --> 00:53:27,676
<b>I'm sure he's mistaken.</b>

660
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:29,745
<b>Why would he do that?
Sun Ho is a detective.</b>

661
00:53:29,769 --> 00:53:31,039
<b>Hyeong Ju.</b>

662
00:53:31,940 --> 00:53:33,539
<b>The culprit is a detective too.</b>

663
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:39,950
<b>I know that. I know,</b>

664
00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:43,626
<b>but even if every detective
in Korea is a suspect,</b>

665
00:53:43,650 --> 00:53:45,190
<b>Sun Ho would never be one.</b>

666
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:49,390
<b>Bae Jung Tae...</b>

667
00:53:50,019 --> 00:53:52,789
<b>was murdered on the day

<b>Ko Jae Young...</b>

669
00:53:55,730 --> 00:53:56,906
<b>had gone missing...</b>

670
00:53:56,930 --> 00:53:59,230
<b>on his way back home
after the questioning.</b>

671
00:54:00,430 --> 00:54:02,240
<b>And on the day
when his body was found,</b>

672
00:54:02,869 --> 00:54:05,839
<b>the culprit sent
a text message to you.</b>

673
00:54:07,339 --> 00:54:09,710
<b>The culprit knew exactly
how the investigation panned out...</b>

674
00:54:10,140 --> 00:54:13,079
<b>and the relationship
between you and Ko Jae Young.</b>

675
00:54:14,380 --> 00:54:17,650
<b>Someone so close to us
was able to do all of this,</b>

676
00:54:19,319 --> 00:54:20,759
<b>but because
we trusted him so much...</b>

677
00:54:21,519 --> 00:54:22,960
<b>and he was so close to us,</b>

678
00:54:25,059 --> 00:54:27,359
<b>- we didn't even suspect him.
- Ga Hyeon.</b>

679
00:54:29,259 --> 00:54:30,559
<b>This isn't a webtoon.</b>

680
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:35,700
<b>You can't just force the story
for the sake of finding the culprit.</b>

681
00:54:37,170 --> 00:54:39,039
<b>I hope I'm imagining things too.</b>

682
00:54:39,670 --> 00:54:41,609
<b>I hope I'm imagining
however I want...</b>

683
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:44,339
<b>because I'm desperate
to catch the culprit.</b>

684
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:46,980
<b>Sun Ho...</b>

685
00:54:47,809 --> 00:54:49,450
<b>is like a family to me.</b>

686
00:54:50,049 --> 00:54:52,390
<b>He's not someone you can
just accuse of being a murderer.</b>

687
00:54:53,349 --> 00:54:54,490
<b>Hyeong Ju.</b>

688
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:03,460
<b>It's a trap.</b>

689
00:55:03,559 --> 00:55:05,406
<b>He probably called the patrol
division after luring me in.</b>

690
00:55:05,430 --> 00:55:06,700
<b>We didn't receive any reports.</b>

691
00:55:06,930 --> 00:55:08,315
<b>The closed buildings
are being inspected.</b>

692
00:55:08,339 --> 00:55:09,316
<b>They found it on their patrol.</b>

693
00:55:09,340 --> 00:55:11,245
<b>I found this from the list of
closed buildings the city manages.</b>

694
00:55:11,269 --> 00:55:13,485
<b>This area will be redeveloped,
so there are no houses here.</b>

695
00:55:13,509 --> 00:55:14,869
<b>And no one will come here as well.</b>

696
00:55:33,529 --> 00:55:35,059
<b>Hey, why are you wandering around?</b>

697
00:55:35,430 --> 00:55:36,900
<b>If you need anything, just call me.</b>

698
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:40,029
<b>Sun Ho.</b>

699
00:55:41,430 --> 00:55:42,569
<b>Yes.</b>

700
00:55:44,069 --> 00:55:45,670
<b>How could you believe...</b>

701
00:55:46,109 --> 00:55:47,609
<b>what I told you that easily?</b>

702
00:55:48,339 --> 00:55:50,116
<b>- What?
- That we were killed...</b>

703
00:55:50,140 --> 00:55:51,210
<b>by a serial killer.</b>

704
00:55:52,710 --> 00:55:56,480
<b>There's no definite evidence.
But why did you believe me?</b>

705
00:55:59,819 --> 00:56:01,890
<b>I still can't fully believe it.</b>

706
00:56:03,859 --> 00:56:05,305
<b>We can't call it
a serial murder because...</b>

707
00:56:05,329 --> 00:56:07,859
<b>a few common items like
a phone and gloves disappeared.</b>

708
00:56:08,130 --> 00:56:09,400
<b>Who would believe that?</b>

709
00:56:09,759 --> 00:56:12,630
<b>I'm just saying I'll believe you
because you said so.</b>

710
00:56:15,140 --> 00:56:16,240
<b>Right.</b>

711
00:56:20,470 --> 00:56:22,109
<b>Sun Ho, let me borrow your car.</b>

712
00:56:22,509 --> 00:56:24,085
<b>My car? Why?
There are checkpoints...</b>

713
00:56:24,109 --> 00:56:25,726
<b>all over the city to catch you.
Where will you go?</b>

714
00:56:25,750 --> 00:56:27,856
<b>I just need to meet someone.</b>

715
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:29,119
<b>Who?</b>

716
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:30,579
<b>Give me your car key.</b>

717
00:56:40,089 --> 00:56:43,029
<b>If you get caught,
say that you stole it from me.</b>

718
00:56:43,259 --> 00:56:44,430
<b>Okay.</b>

719
00:57:07,819 --> 00:57:10,420
<b>(Detective Park Sun Ho)</b>

720
00:57:12,089 --> 00:57:16,200
<b>(Detective Park Sun Ho,
Slide to Answer)</b>

721
00:58:04,940 --> 00:58:07,356
<b>But can't you just check
the security footage?</b>

722
00:58:07,380 --> 00:58:10,579
<b>Sadly, that was
when the cameras got changed,</b>

723
00:58:10,750 --> 00:58:12,926
<b>so there's no way
to prove your innocence.</b>

724
00:58:12,950 --> 00:58:15,789
<b>I fell asleep
on my way down from the mountain.</b>

725
00:58:16,319 --> 00:58:18,220
<b>Then I heard two women in a fight.</b>

726
00:58:18,460 --> 00:58:20,730
<b>I left the park after she did.</b>

727
00:58:28,329 --> 00:58:29,539
<b>What brings you here?</b>

728
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:34,769
<b>Excuse me.
Is there Mr. Choi Hyun Woo?</b>

729
00:58:34,910 --> 00:58:36,940
<b>That's me. What is this about?</b>

730
00:58:39,609 --> 00:58:40,609
<b>Well...</b>

731
00:58:43,019 --> 00:58:44,250
<b>Detective Ji.</b>

732
00:58:45,450 --> 00:58:47,220
<b>Detective Park asked me for a favor.</b>

733
00:58:47,650 --> 00:58:49,795
<b>He said it was a simple accident,
but an innocent woman...</b>

734
00:58:49,819 --> 00:58:51,899
<b>was in a tight spot
because she didn't have an alibi.</b>

735
00:58:52,190 --> 00:58:54,235
<b>I know how that feels
because I had been falsely accused.</b>

736
00:58:54,259 --> 00:58:56,529
<b>So I just made the report
as he asked.</b>

737
00:58:57,599 --> 00:58:58,976
<b>He didn't commit suicide.</b>

738
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,606
<b>Given the circumstances,
it wasn't an accident.</b>

739
00:59:00,630 --> 00:59:02,170
<b>Are you saying he was murdered?</b>

740
00:59:02,869 --> 00:59:04,616
<b>The owner of a store
nearby testified...</b>

741
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:06,960
<b>that Cha Jeung Seok purchased
charcoal briquettes from him.</b>

742
00:59:07,269 --> 00:59:08,246
<b>It's been a few years...</b>

743
00:59:08,270 --> 00:59:10,030
<b>since we stopped selling
charcoal briquettes.</b>

744
00:59:11,509 --> 00:59:14,380
<b>I would've remembered
if a detective came.</b>

745
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:38,970
<b>Why did you come here?
What if I wanted to call the police?</b>

746
00:59:40,809 --> 00:59:41,980
<b>Who is...</b>

747
00:59:45,779 --> 00:59:46,880
<b>the culprit?</b>

748
00:59:47,849 --> 00:59:49,980
<b>I think you already know the answer.</b>

749
00:59:52,519 --> 00:59:55,049
<b>I guess you didn't have
the courage to ask him yourself.</b>

750
01:00:01,559 --> 01:00:02,660
<b>That's right.</b>

751
01:00:04,099 --> 01:00:05,769
<b>It's Detective Park Sun Ho...</b>

752
01:00:08,369 --> 01:00:09,940
<b>whom you had saved.</b>

753
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:17,109
<b>He's the culprit.</b>

754
01:00:18,710 --> 01:00:20,309
<b>But Sun Ho died.</b>

755
01:00:21,250 --> 01:00:24,019
<b>- But...
- It was actually quite easy.</b>

756
01:00:24,450 --> 01:00:27,819
<b>You just had to avoid the place

757
01:00:28,019 --> 01:00:29,319
<b>Are you Mr. Cha Jeung Seok?</b>

758
01:00:29,420 --> 01:00:30,519
<b>Where are you taking me?</b>

759
01:00:31,390 --> 01:00:32,630
<b>What happened?</b>

760
01:00:35,299 --> 01:00:37,759
<b>Did you really think
I would save you one at a time?</b>

761
01:00:38,529 --> 01:00:41,000
<b>It was quite simple as long
as I took care of one culprit.</b>

762
01:00:57,150 --> 01:00:59,519
<b>You know Ji Hyeong Ju?</b>

763
01:01:00,420 --> 01:01:03,319
<b>And I know a lot about you,
Mr. Oh Myung Chul.</b>

764
01:01:04,759 --> 01:01:07,289
<b>I know that you're going

765
01:01:09,460 --> 01:01:13,329
<b>But do you know

766
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:18,970
<b>If you just kill him,</b>

767
01:01:20,269 --> 01:01:22,079
<b>that's too easy.</b>

768
01:01:23,710 --> 01:01:25,240
<b>Making him suffer in pain...</b>

769
01:01:26,509 --> 01:01:28,450
<b>until his last breath...</b>

770
01:01:30,650 --> 01:01:32,089
<b>is true revenge.</b>

771
01:01:40,089 --> 01:01:41,430
<b>But someone said...</b>

772
01:01:43,329 --> 01:01:46,569
<b>the killing would be too easy.</b>

773
01:01:47,170 --> 01:01:50,140
<b>It's better to let you live in pain
until the day you die.</b>

774
01:01:50,970 --> 01:01:52,940
<b>That's true revenge.</b>

775
01:01:54,339 --> 01:01:58,240
<b>Until my fifth reset,
Oh Myung Chul was trying to kill...</b>

776
01:01:59,809 --> 01:02:01,210
<b>you.</b>

777
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:04,480
<b>But he failed every time...</b>

778
01:02:05,319 --> 01:02:07,420
<b>and was arrested by you.</b>

779
01:02:08,220 --> 01:02:10,890
<b>And all I did was
just twist that fate.</b>

780
01:02:14,029 --> 01:02:15,660
<b>Thanks to Oh Myung Chul,</b>

781
01:02:16,799 --> 01:02:19,500
<b>I was able to undergo
the reset with you all.</b>

782
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
<b>Everything was planned
from the get-go?</b>

783
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:26,240
<b>Are you telling me
because I saved him...</b>

784
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:30,509
<b>people died?</b>

785
01:02:34,809 --> 01:02:36,180
<b>Is that what it is?</b>

786
01:02:38,619 --> 01:02:40,450
<b>Why on earth are you doing this?</b>

787
01:02:43,019 --> 01:02:44,819
<b>You have a child whom you must save.</b>

788
01:02:45,890 --> 01:02:48,035
<b>You know firsthand
how painful death is.</b>

789
01:02:48,059 --> 01:02:50,500
<b>That's why I gave you all a chance.</b>

790
01:02:51,359 --> 01:02:54,029
<b>I wanted to see
if anyone would be able to...</b>

791
01:02:55,130 --> 01:02:56,440
<b>change their fate.</b>

792
01:03:06,309 --> 01:03:07,849
<b>Now that you know
who the culprit is,</b>

793
01:03:09,319 --> 01:03:11,119
<b>you just need to catch him.</b>

794
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:14,390
<b>I'll keep watching to find out...</b>

795
01:03:15,519 --> 01:03:17,490
<b>who will survive in the end...</b>

796
01:03:19,190 --> 01:03:21,259
<b>and if changing one's fate
is possible.</b>

797
01:04:27,160 --> 01:04:28,230
<b>Isn't that Detective Ji?</b>

798
01:04:30,029 --> 01:04:31,099
<b>That's him.</b>

799
01:04:35,030 --> 01:04:36,139
<b>Stop right there.</b>

800
01:04:36,500 --> 01:04:37,639
<b>Stop.</b>

801
01:04:38,369 --> 01:04:39,440
<b>Detective Ji.</b>
