<b>- Go home.
- Detective Cha.</b>

174
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:45,932
<b>Hyung Bin, why are you doing this?</b>

175
00:16:46,569 --> 00:16:48,091
<b>There are no eyewitnesses...</b>

176
00:16:48,869 --> 00:16:50,437

<b>Do you think he's the real criminal?</b>

232
00:24:07,297 --> 00:24:09,018
<b>Gong Ji Chul is...</b>

233
00:24:09,042 --> 00:24:12,312
<b>in denial of all crimes

234

<b>People have no interest

<b>- You deserve to die.
- Oh, my goodness.</b>

<b>He'll hurt himself

244
00:25:11,093 --> 00:25:12,586
<b>The reason he wants to die is...</b>

245
00:25:12,875 --> 00:25:14,640
<b>that he couldn't kill anyone.</b>

246

<b>She's going to die anyway

<b>Who is your accomplice

00:26:08,467 --> 00:26:09,822
<b>he doesn't have a son.</b>

256
00:26:11,615 --> 00:26:16,461
<b>Who painted "Reading Mary"?</b>

257
00:26:18,537 --> 00:26:19,889
<b>I went to that book store...</b>

258
00:26:21,577 --> 00:26:22,882

259

<b>- The "Old Future."

260
00:26:30,531 --> 00:26:33,008
<b>I can hear the music box
from the entrance.</b>

261
00:26:34,998 --> 00:26:36,249
<b>There's a photo...</b>

262
00:26:37,561 --> 00:26:39,327
<b>of Ha Eun's family on the counter.</b>

263
00:26:42,617 --> 00:26:44,101
<b>She likes tangerines,</b>

264
00:26:44,805 --> 00:26:46,609
<b>which is why she drinks
tangerine tea.</b>

265

<b>Since when...</b>

<b>But...</b>

269
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:01,078
<b>I went to that book store...</b>

270
00:27:01,805 --> 00:27:03,227
<b>even before you met Jung Ha Eun.</b>

271
00:27:04,468 --> 00:27:06,016
<b>I probably know her better
than you do.</b>

272
00:27:07,094 --> 00:27:08,539
<b>I know the way she laughs,</b>

273
00:27:08,913 --> 00:27:10,468
<b>the way she gets mad,</b>

274
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:13,523
<b>and the way she closes her eye...</b>

275
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:16,178
<b>when she eats a sour tangerine.</b>

276
00:27:17,367 --> 00:27:19,359
<b>I also know how she looks...</b>

277

<b>She grew up like an orphan.</b>

289

<b>You know what an orphan is,

<b>There are no murderers

<b>A new life?</b>

<b>Even if he were sentenced to death

<b>Did you see it with your own eyes?</b>

467
00:41:58,481 --> 00:42:00,536
<b>Is Gong Ji Chul the real criminal?</b>

<b>Yes, I did.</b>

474

<b>How did he kill her?</b>

475
00:42:31,605 --> 00:42:32,781
<b>He hit her head...</b>

476
00:42:33,402 --> 00:42:36,079

<b>the defendant scribbled this here?</b>

481

<b>It's...</b>

482
00:42:52,387 --> 00:42:54,589
<b>because he'd always watched me

<b>Did you ever think he could

<b>In these cases, he won't remember...</b>

512

<b>This isn't a murder.</b>

513

00:57:35,778 --> 00:57:37,379
<b>Did Ha Eun arrive at the cathedral?</b>

622
00:57:38,013 --> 00:57:40,048
<b>Cha Hyung Bin is...</b>

623
00:57:40,916 --> 00:57:42,284
<b>with me right now.</b>

624
00:57:42,951 --> 00:57:43,952
<b>Father.</b>

625
00:57:44,253 --> 00:57:45,787
<b>Look at his face carefully...</b>

626
00:57:45,865 --> 00:57:47,389
<b>if he has a scar on his left eye.</b>

627
00:57:51,277 --> 00:57:54,162
<b>My vision is not so clear.</b>

628
00:57:54,533 --> 00:57:56,198
<b>I can't see it well.</b>

629
00:58:03,021 --> 00:58:04,306
<b>Was it Cha Hyung Bin...</b>

630
00:58:06,125 --> 00:58:07,330
<b>on the phone?</b>

631
00:58:09,897 --> 00:58:10,897
<b>Are you here...</b>

632
00:58:13,173 --> 00:58:15,250
<b>to kill people?</b>

633
00:58:17,478 --> 00:58:19,095
<b>Can people who committed suicide...</b>

634
00:58:21,108 --> 00:58:22,557
<b>born again?</b>

635
00:58:26,195 --> 00:58:27,329
<b>All men are...</b>

636
00:58:28,397 --> 00:58:30,232
<b>sinners.</b>

637
00:58:30,866 --> 00:58:33,268
<b>We can be forgiven by the lord.</b>

638
00:58:36,138 --> 00:58:37,139
<b>Lord...</b>

639
00:58:38,588 --> 00:58:39,588
<b>No.</b>

640
00:58:40,093 --> 00:58:42,577
<b>I don't need him,

641
00:58:44,379 --> 00:58:45,379
<b>No.</b>

642
00:58:48,206 --> 00:58:49,885
<b>I want to ask her...</b>

643
00:58:52,603 --> 00:58:54,656
<b>if I really can't become human.</b>

644
00:58:58,662 --> 00:59:00,338
<b>I came to tell her...</b>

645
00:59:04,694 --> 00:59:06,195
<b>that I don't want to become a beast.</b>

646
00:59:10,236 --> 00:59:12,201
<b>I want to prove...</b>

647
00:59:14,276 --> 00:59:15,516
<b>that her faith is not mistaken.</b>

648
00:59:17,949 --> 00:59:19,030
<b>Jung Ha Eun...</b>

649
00:59:21,917 --> 00:59:23,352
<b>was the first person...</b>

650
00:59:25,787 --> 00:59:27,689
<b>who looked me straight in the eye.</b>

651
00:59:30,226 --> 00:59:31,329
<b>She was the first one...</b>

652
00:59:37,116 --> 00:59:38,828
<b>to call my name.</b>

653
01:01:49,097 --> 01:01:51,933
<b>I am...</b>

654
01:01:58,189 --> 01:01:59,374
<b>Gong Ji Chul.</b>

655
01:02:14,199 --> 01:02:15,392
<b>I told you...</b>

656
01:02:16,057 --> 01:02:18,360
<b>you'd be dead

<b>You'll escape

658
01:02:21,663 --> 01:02:23,665
<b>You'll never get over it...</b>

659
01:02:24,366 --> 01:02:25,500
<b>until you kill Ha Eun.</b>

660
01:02:26,401 --> 01:02:27,802
<b>Murder is the only way you have.</b>

661
01:02:28,695 --> 01:02:29,971
<b>Please give me time...</b>

662
01:02:32,068 --> 01:02:33,575
<b>for once.</b>

663
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:39,040
<b>Did you give them time
before you killed all those girls?</b>

664
01:02:41,537 --> 01:02:42,918
<b>No!</b>

665
01:03:10,078 --> 01:03:11,212
<b>Hyung Bin.</b>

666
01:03:28,660 --> 01:03:29,959
<b>Hyung Bin.</b>

667
01:03:35,647 --> 01:03:38,039
<b>Hyung Bin.</b>

668
01:03:53,371 --> 01:03:55,090
<b>No!</b>

669
01:04:07,548 --> 01:04:08,634
<b>No.</b>

670
01:04:10,038 --> 01:04:11,506
<b>Don't do this.</b>

671
01:04:18,982 --> 01:04:20,281
<b>Hyung Bin.</b>

672
01:04:29,057 --> 01:04:31,059
<b>You can never go to Ha Eun.</b>

673
01:04:56,017 --> 01:04:57,318
<b>Hyung Bin.</b>

674
01:04:57,585 --> 01:04:58,620
<b>Ha Eun.</b>

675
01:04:58,920 --> 01:04:59,988
<b>Ha Eun.</b>

676
01:05:00,997 --> 01:05:02,590
<b>Please save Ha Eun.</b>

677
01:05:12,167 --> 01:05:13,470
<b>Ha Eun.</b>

678
01:05:39,443 --> 01:05:40,528
<b>I told you...</b>

679

<b>that souls will be reborn,</b>

680
01:05:44,866 --> 01:05:47,035
<b>didn't I?</b>

681
01:05:50,327 --> 01:05:51,806
<b>Gong Ji Chul,</b>

01:05:52,542 --> 01:05:54,242
<b>listen to me.</b>

01:05:56,668 --> 01:05:58,146
<b>You'll never...</b>

684
01:06:00,048 --> 01:06:01,816
<b>be able to come back to life.</b>

685
01:06:32,472 --> 01:06:34,916
<b>My plan to give her my heart...</b>

686
01:06:35,728 --> 01:06:37,085
<b>became a failure.</b>

687
01:06:38,072 --> 01:06:40,588
<b>I had hoped
that would be the last time...</b>

688
01:06:41,383 --> 01:06:43,358
<b>and the end of my destiny

689
01:06:44,225 --> 01:06:45,225
<b>Just like the curse...</b>

690
01:06:46,394 --> 01:06:47,796
<b>of Jung Ha Eun,</b>

691
01:06:48,299 --> 01:06:50,465
<b>I hoped my soul that was tarnished

692
01:06:51,026 --> 01:06:52,901
<b>would not be resurrected.</b>

693
01:06:53,802 --> 01:06:55,010
<b>I hoped again and again.</b>

<b>I'm done.</b>

695

<b>That was quick.</b>

01:08:15,983 --> 01:08:17,896
<b>I have the habit of reading

<b>("The Man You Cannot Meet

698

<b>But don't you need

699
01:08:23,315 --> 01:08:24,995
<b>They say notes are

700

<b>The first person to read the book...</b>

<b>What is this...</b>

707
01:09:31,575 --> 01:09:34,028
<b>- deja vu?
