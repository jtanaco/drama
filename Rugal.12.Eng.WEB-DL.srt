<b>Bong Man-cheol was alive when

<b>Even our stubborn team leader

<b>Fine.</b>

24
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,230
<b>It never crossed my mind

25
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:07,240
<b>He didn't talk as if he was bewitched,
and something was off about him, too.</b>

26
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,490
<b>He must've been resolute once he decided
to become an undercover agent.</b>

27
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:14,160
<b>He was good enough to fool Hwang Deuk-gu.</b>

28

<b>He stayed in there as long as

<b>He must've been lonely.</b>

00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:23,880
<b>But you're not, right?</b>

31
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:25,420
<b>What?</b>

32
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,510
<b>Well, I'm not alone.</b>

33
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:32,220
<b>By the way, what happened to Choi Ye-won?</b>

34
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:36,470
<b>She called to ask for your help,
and Mi-na answered it.</b>

35
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:39,480
<b>She didn't have to answer it. Why did she?</b>

36
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:42,440
<b>It probably got on her nerves.
And she was pissed, too.</b>

37
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,730
<b>Ye-won was one of the people
behind this mess, too.</b>

38
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:47,110
<b>I bet it was intense.</b>

39
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,860
<b>We handled it pretty well.</b>

40
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:54,280
<b>Instead of perceiving her as a threat,
Mi-na decided to treat her as a resource.</b>

41
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:56,580
<b>She's learning.
She can see the bigger picture.</b>

42
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:00,540
<b>But Choi Ye-won isn't an easy target.</b>

43
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,960
<b>She can cut a deal
with the Commissioner-General.</b>

44
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,090
<b>She saw what we're capable of.</b>

45
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:07,210
<b>She'll call again.</b>

46
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:11,630
<b>Like you told me,
if Choi Yong has turned his back on her,</b>

47
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:14,680
<b>she has no choice but to team up
with us or Hwang Deuk-gu.</b>

48
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:18,600
<b>If she chooses Hwang Deuk-gu,
we'll be her target.</b>

49
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:20,100
<b>"We"?</b>

50
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,350
<b>I like the sound of that.</b>

51
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,480
<b>What?</b>

52
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,700
<b>Look. I told you I have sharp eyes.</b>

53
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:41,080
<b>I picked the perfect size and color
for them. Right?</b>

54
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,710
<b>Gi-beom, don't I look slick?</b>

55
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:44,870
<b>I want to buy this in every color.</b>

56
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,080
<b>You are way over the top.</b>

57
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:48,290
<b>I think I'll look great in blue, too.</b>

58
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,130
<b>Get me another one if you can.</b>

59
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:53,760
<b>Hold on. Are you implying that I should
go through a near-death experience again?</b>

60
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:56,340
<b>I know you'll come back alive.
Don't whine.</b>

61
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,760
<b>I'm happy that you guys like the jacket.</b>

62
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:02,810
<b>But don't you think we stand out
too much in these jackets?</b>

63
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,310
<b>That's not a bad thing, per se.</b>

64
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,310
<b>If we're going to get exposed,</b>

65
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,780
<b>we will choose when and how
we will show ourselves to the world.</b>

66
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:14,150
<b>Chief Choi gave us his permission.</b>

-It's dangerous.</b>

71

<b>I cannot let you go through

73

<b>He's not a bad guy, right?</b>

74
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,890
<b>-What?
-The guy I saw.</b>

<b>Gi-jun.</b>

76

<b>My father taught me

<b>Do you remember the lawyer we saved?

<b>I see. That guy.</b>

87

<b>Yes, this is his son.</b>

88

<b>The men who harmed us

<i><b>The men in black masks saved me.</i></b>

90

<b>-I guess he remembers us.
-Yes.</b>

91

<b>But you won't post this online, right?</b>

92
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,300
<b>He wants to tell people about you.</b>

93
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,800
<b>I managed to stop him
from uploading this on social media.</b>

94

<b>But he's planning to film videos

<b>I was curious about your opinions.</b>

96

<b>Isn't this too dangerous?</b>

<b>Hey.</b>

<b>Our duty is to help and leave without

<b>Goodness, you're so dramatic.</b>

109
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:54,440
<b>Mi-na, we have to leave proof

<b>for insurance purposes.</b>

<b>Boom, boom, boom.</b>

<b>Anyway, reveal us or not,

<b>The only thing left to do
is returning the favor tenfold.</b>

117

<b>All right, then.
So we have somewhat of a plan now.</b>

<b>And our outfits are ready, too.</b>

119

<b>Where should we start?</b>

00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:26,350
<b>We have some killer moves, don't we?</b>

00:07:57,670 --> 00:08:00,880
<b>Don't be so shocked.

<b>What I want to know is your opinion.</b>

<b>or save him?</b>

<b>You go first, old man.</b>

<b>Well...</b>

00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,310
<b>Kill him.</b>

128
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,060
<b>Kill him? What's your reason?</b>

129
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:21,110
<b>Reducing the pain he's feeling

130
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:25,070
<b>-What if I don't want to?
-He won't be any use to us.</b>

131
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:28,570
<b>We can't even recycle him in that state.</b>

132
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:29,700
<b>Just end it.</b>

133
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,910

<b>can you do for me now?</b>

<b>Pardon?</b>

00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:48,800
<b>Your research was a failure.</b>

<b>And you're a weak old man.</b>

00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:33,630

<b>Choi Yong is using this momentum
to win the guys over to his side.</b>

302
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,100
<b>I don't trust anyone now.</b>

303
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:42,310
<b>I can understand.</b>

304
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:45,980
<b>I was worried when I found out
that you were gone.</b>

305
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,310
<b>I'm glad you're okay.</b>

306
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:52,190
<b>I still can't believe
that Man-cheol is dead.</b>

307
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:54,740
<b>And he was killed by Yong
whom he followed like a brother.</b>

308
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:57,780
<b>Don't you remember
Man-cheol was going to kill you?</b>

309
00:20:57,870 --> 00:21:00,370
<b>I do, but I doubt that
he was able to pull the trigger.</b>

<b>We've known each other for so long.</b>

<b>but we don't have time to get sentimental.</b>

313

<b>What did you do with the body?</b>

314
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:14,210
<b>He was shot, so it must've been difficult.</b>

315
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,510
<b>It will be concluded as an accident.</b>

316
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:18,760
<b>Whatever happens,
I'll make sure that it does.</b>

317
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:24,890
<b>I'll take over Man-cheol's business.</b>

318
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:27,770
<b>It's better that I do, so that way,
I can give you more support.</b>

319
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,570
<b>I have something else in mind.</b>

320
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,190
<b>Like what?</b>

321
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:39,700
<b>Why do you think
something like this happened?</b>

322
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,450
<b>It's because I gave others power.</b>

323
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:46,160
<b>It may be peaceful when it's balanced.</b>

324
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:49,290
<b>But the smallest difference

get rid of Yong by using Hwang Deuk-gu.</b>

<b>you'll need Min Dal-ho.</b>

603
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:31,560
<b>While keeping the chief in the dark?</b>

604
00:46:33,270 --> 00:46:34,150
<b>Yes, for now.</b>

605
00:46:36,070 --> 00:46:38,070
<b>I'm only telling you
because we never keep secrets.</b>

606
00:46:39,410 --> 00:46:42,780
<b>Don't worry. My lips are sealed.
Is there anything I can help you with?</b>

607
00:46:44,540 --> 00:46:48,620
<b>Just letting us do what needs to be done
is how you can help us.</b>

608
00:46:50,250 --> 00:46:51,540
<b>But Tae-woong,</b>

609
00:46:52,290 --> 00:46:54,460
<b>could her being alive
be a good thing at this point?</b>

610
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:57,260
<b>I'm not sure.</b>

611
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:59,430
<b>If this doesn't end well,</b>

612
00:46:59,590 --> 00:47:00,840
<b>we'll be in big trouble.</b>

613
00:47:04,470 --> 00:47:06,930
<b>Considering how Gi-beom could get hurt...</b>

614
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:10,060
<b>Well, it's hard to tell what's right.</b>

615
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:11,900
<b>Getting hurt</b>

616
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:14,610
<b>is the same for us as well.</b>

617
00:47:17,610 --> 00:47:18,650
<b>I know.</b>

618
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:22,610
<i><b>But you know what?</i></b>

619
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:27,410
<b>Why is everyone you are looking for
found around me?</b>

620
00:47:27,490 --> 00:47:28,700
<b>Did you see it?</b>

621
00:47:28,790 --> 00:47:30,910
<b>Did you check the corpse
and made sure she was dead?</b>

622
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:46,100
<i><b>There's no evidence to suggest
that she didn't die that day.</i></b>

623
00:47:46,890 --> 00:47:49,100
<i><b>I knew there wouldn't be holes
with the paperwork.</i></b>

624
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:51,350
<i><b>We must take another approach.</i></b>

625
00:47:54,810 --> 00:47:55,810
<b>Yes, it's me.</b>

626
00:47:57,270 --> 00:48:00,190
<b>I was craving bread when I was in jail.</b>

627
00:48:01,150 --> 00:48:03,570
<b>Get some of the ones he might like, okay?</b>

628
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:19,380
<b>Kang Gi-beom?</b>

629
00:48:22,050 --> 00:48:22,880
<b>Han Tae-woong!</b>

630
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:25,010
<b>I thought you were dead.</b>

631
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:29,560
<b>Is playing dead a hobby of yours?</b>

632
00:48:30,220 --> 00:48:31,350
<b>That's not why we're here.</b>

633
00:48:31,430 --> 00:48:32,480
<b>What?</b>

634
00:48:33,350 --> 00:48:34,350
<b>Min Dal-ho,</b>

635
00:48:35,770 --> 00:48:38,520
<b>you will answer my questions truthfully.</b>

636
00:48:38,610 --> 00:48:40,610
<b>What the hell are you talking about?</b>

637
00:48:40,690 --> 00:48:41,740
<b>Kim Yeo-jin.</b>

638
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:44,400
<b>Was it you who killed her?</b>

639
00:48:44,490 --> 00:48:45,950
<b>Why ask when you saw everything?</b>

640
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:50,950
<b>Oh, right.</b>

641
00:48:51,910 --> 00:48:52,960
<b>You didn't see everything.</b>

642
00:48:59,250 --> 00:49:00,920
<b>Just kill him and save us our time.</b>

643
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:06,300
<b>No, wait. Hold on!</b>

644
00:49:10,470 --> 00:49:11,350
<b>What's wrong?</b>

645
00:49:12,270 --> 00:49:13,770
<b>I'm only doing what you did to me.</b>

646
00:49:14,850 --> 00:49:17,270
<b>What makes me sick is that
your face was the last thing I saw.</b>

647
00:49:19,570 --> 00:49:21,320
<b>It's only fair that I'm your last too.</b>

648
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:22,530
<b>I didn't kill her!</b>

649
00:49:22,610 --> 00:49:24,740
<b>-That's a lie.
-It's not.</b>

650
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:30,530
<b>It wasn't me.</b>

651
00:49:31,830 --> 00:49:34,750
<b>-Was it one of the guys with you that day?
-No.</b>

652
00:49:34,830 --> 00:49:36,790
<b>Only you guys were there,
so don't fuck with me.</b>

653
00:49:36,870 --> 00:49:39,710
<b>That's not true. There was someone else.</b>

654
00:49:40,540 --> 00:49:42,300
<b>-What?
-There was someone else</b>

655
00:49:43,050 --> 00:49:44,340
<b>before we went in.</b>

656
00:49:51,930 --> 00:49:53,430
<b>Hey, who are you?</b>

657
00:49:54,060 --> 00:49:57,190
<b>I took care of the girl. They want you to
take out the guy's eyes and not kill him.</b>

658
00:49:57,270 --> 00:49:59,150
<b>What? Why?</b>

659
00:49:59,230 --> 00:50:00,690
<b>It's easier to pin it on him.</b>

660
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:02,360
<b>Okay.</b>

661
00:50:09,070 --> 00:50:10,870
<b>Who was that? Who was the bastard?</b>

662
00:50:10,950 --> 00:50:13,830
<b>How could I have recognized
someone in a mask?</b>

663
00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:15,790
<b>But you would know who sent him!</b>

664
00:50:15,870 --> 00:50:18,040
<b>It was probably Deuk-gu.</b>

665
00:50:18,750 --> 00:50:20,880
<b>He was the one who sent us to you too.</b>

666
00:50:25,380 --> 00:50:26,800
<b>And once again</b>

667
00:50:28,380 --> 00:50:29,800
<b>we're back with Hwang Deuk-gu.</b>

668
00:50:36,850 --> 00:50:43,480
<b>RELIABLE, TRUSTWORTHY</b>

669
00:51:01,830 --> 00:51:02,670
<b>Mi-na.</b>

670
00:51:03,750 --> 00:51:04,630
<b>Over here.</b>

671
00:51:07,710 --> 00:51:08,880
<b>It's been a while, Mun-bok.</b>

672
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:11,720
<b>Let's head inside.</b>

673
00:51:18,430 --> 00:51:19,270
<b>Mun-bok,</b>

674
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:21,810
<b>you were the first</b>

675
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:25,190
<b>to arrive on the scene
the day Yeo-jin was attacked, right?</b>

676
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:26,860
<b>Yes.</b>

677
00:51:27,530 --> 00:51:28,690
<b>I was nearby.</b>

678
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:31,450
<b>Did you have plans with Gi-beom?</b>

679
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:33,570
<b>Not exactly.</b>

680
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:36,370
<b>Gi-beom was in a terrible mood
after being grilled</b>

681
00:51:36,450 --> 00:51:38,200
<b>by the disciplinary committee.</b>

682
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:41,120
<b>I was heading over to his place
to buy him a drink.</b>

683
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:46,630
<b>Did you spot anything odd
at his place that night?</b>

684
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:48,340
<b>Something odd?</b>

685
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:51,010
<b>According to the case files,</b>

686
00:51:51,090 --> 00:51:53,430
<b>there was no sign of forced entry
into his house.</b>

687
00:51:54,470 --> 00:51:57,100
<b>How could Min Dal-ho get in
without breaking the door?</b>

688
00:52:00,390 --> 00:52:01,690
<b>Let's get this straight.</b>

689
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:04,270
<b>Officially, Min Dal-ho
isn't a suspect anymore.</b>

690
00:52:04,350 --> 00:52:06,650
<b>An alibi puts him
somewhere away from the scene.</b>

691
00:52:06,730 --> 00:52:09,110
<b>But you know that isn't true.</b>

692
00:52:10,610 --> 00:52:11,740
<b>To have forced his way in,</b>

693
00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:14,870
<b>the front door had to be broken
or at least be kicked in.</b>

694
00:52:14,950 --> 00:52:16,280
<b>According to the case files,</b>

695
00:52:16,830 --> 00:52:17,830
<b>none of that happened.</b>

696
00:52:18,620 --> 00:52:19,750
<b>That's one of the reasons</b>

697
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:22,540
<b>why Gi-beom was made a prime suspect.</b>

698
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:25,790
<b>Is there a possibility
of a third-party being involved?</b>

699
00:52:26,210 --> 00:52:30,130
<b>Not Gi-beom, but someone he knew...</b>

700
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:32,840
<b>Hold on a second.</b>

701
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:35,220
<b>Is that what you came here to ask me?</b>

702
00:52:35,890 --> 00:52:37,760
<b>I'm being dead serious right now.</b>

703
00:52:50,730 --> 00:52:53,610
<b>There's the man
who put himself behind bars.</b>

704
00:53:06,210 --> 00:53:07,670
<b>The law sure has its perks, right?</b>

705
00:53:07,750 --> 00:53:09,210
<b>Even a thug like you</b>

706
00:53:09,590 --> 00:53:11,170
<b>can feel safe from people like me.</b>

707
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:13,050
<b>And who the fuck are you?</b>

708
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:21,520
<b>Finally,</b>

709
00:53:23,020 --> 00:53:24,350
<b>I get to see your face.</b>

710
00:53:25,060 --> 00:53:27,190
<b>It must because you lack presence,</b>

711
00:53:27,270 --> 00:53:29,480
<b>Lee Gwang-cheol.</b>

712
00:53:31,650 --> 00:53:32,980
<b>I see you haven't been updated.</b>

713
00:53:33,570 --> 00:53:35,570
<b>Well, I took care of all your underlings.</b>

714
00:53:35,650 --> 00:53:37,160
<b>I guess you don't use the internet.</b>

715
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:40,280
<b>I shouldn't have bothered
trying to track you down.</b>

716
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:44,200
<b>You would've flocked over to me
one way or another anyway.</b>

717
00:53:46,330 --> 00:53:47,920
<b>Have you heard of digging your own grave?</b>

718
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:50,540
<b>It's like biting yourself in the ass.</b>

719
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:53,510
<b>Sounds familiar, right?</b>

720
00:53:57,380 --> 00:53:59,720
<b>You're all the same, aren't you?</b>

721
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:02,930
<b>You and all your cheeky, arrogant advice.</b>

722
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:06,640
<b>Now get lost!</b>

723
00:54:08,730 --> 00:54:10,310
<b>Enjoy your stay, then.</b>

724
00:54:34,170 --> 00:54:35,380
<b>He truly is something else.</b>

725
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:38,050
<b>The bastard is ice-cold.</b>

726
00:54:41,010 --> 00:54:42,640
<b>Gwang-cheol, don't be a wimp.</b>

727
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:47,600
<b>Damn it.</b>

728
00:54:48,310 --> 00:54:51,900
<b>The records show
just how meticulous Argos was.</b>

729
00:54:51,980 --> 00:54:53,270
<b>His colleagues died</b>

730
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:55,690
<b>and the disciplinary committee
suspended him.</b>

731
00:54:55,780 --> 00:54:57,650
<b>His wife nagged him at home</b>

732
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:00,660
<b>and things escalated
leading to him killing her.</b>

733
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:03,700
<b>After coming to his sense,
he couldn't stand what he had done,</b>

734
00:55:03,780 --> 00:55:04,950
<b>so he mangled his eyes.</b>

735
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:08,040
<b>That's a tight scenario
they cooked up for Gi-beom.</b>

736
00:55:08,620 --> 00:55:12,380
<b>I asked all of the questions
and confirmed what we needed to know,</b>

737
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:15,380
<b>but something just doesn't feel right.</b>

738
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:17,760
<b>The security camera footage was erased,</b>

739
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:19,720
<b>so there's nothing but testimonies
to go on.</b>

740
00:55:20,010 --> 00:55:20,880
<b>Gwang-cheol.</b>

741
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:24,260
<b>Why are you walking so fast?</b>

742
00:55:27,180 --> 00:55:29,940
<b>While you were with Detective Yang,
I paid Hwang Deuk-gu a visit.</b>

743
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:32,270
<b>Hwang Deuk-gu?</b>

744
00:55:32,850 --> 00:55:34,650
<b>How did it feel to meet him face-to-face?</b>

745
00:55:36,020 --> 00:55:36,860
<b>I'm not sure.</b>

746
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:41,240
<b>Back then, I was too busy
fighting for my life.</b>

747
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:43,660
<b>I got the chills though.</b>

748
00:55:45,490 --> 00:55:48,660
<b>Doesn't he seem like the type
to shred anyone who gets in his way?</b>

749
00:55:49,540 --> 00:55:52,170
<b>Like the cannibal killer.</b>

750
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:55,710
<b>If you don't stay strong,</b>

751
00:55:55,790 --> 00:55:57,630
<b>he'll eat you up in seconds.</b>

752
00:55:57,710 --> 00:56:00,170
<b>It's why I admire Gi-beom.</b>

753
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:02,930
<b>Remember the jazz bar?</b>

754
00:56:03,430 --> 00:56:06,390
<b>The eyes malfunctioned due to an error

<b>He held his composure though

756
00:56:11,690 --> 00:56:13,480
<b>I should start training

758

759
00:56:18,860 --> 00:56:19,690
<b>I'll at least try.</b>

760

<b>Anyway, let's go.</b>

761

<b>Damn, he gives me the heebie-jeebies.</b>

762

<b>Compare the knife that attacked my eyes

<i><b>One wound's size is different

765

<i><b>Nothing found at the scene</i></b>

766
00:56:59,820 --> 00:57:03,280

767
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:05,490
<b>Can you obtain footage
from nearby security cameras?</b>

768
00:57:05,570 --> 00:57:08,160
<i><b>They probably erased the footage
since the storage period is over.</i></b>

769
00:57:08,830 --> 00:57:11,790
<b>I don't carry you around

770

<b>Find a way, you prick.</b>

771
00:57:24,550 --> 00:57:27,050
<b>Why do you think Hwang Deuk-gu</b>

772

<b>is obsessed with you?</b>

773
00:57:29,890 --> 00:57:31,220

774

775

<b>It's true that you provoke him.</b>

776

<b>Is this all my fault then?</b>

777
00:57:41,780 --> 00:57:43,690
<b>Stopping your crusade here

778

<b>Letting our fight be controlled by him</b>

779

<b>You're right.</b>

781
00:57:52,660 --> 00:57:54,450
<b>But let me look into one thing more.</b>

782
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:56,160
<b>If that doesn't pan out,</b>

783

784
00:57:58,420 --> 00:58:00,130

785

<b>Why wasn't Min Dal-ho

<b>The fact that you found this</b>

804

805
