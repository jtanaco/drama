<b>He was saved by Seo Sang Won.</b>

159

<b>There's a debt

160

<b>And he's looking for the gospel

161
00:12:11,714 --> 00:12:15,270
<b>Eun Ho got sucked into that mess

<b>Then what about Choi Dae Hoon,

<b>Jang Ki Ho is also their sibling?</b>

<b>Yes, I heard it from himself.</b>

178
00:12:54,538 --> 00:12:58,150
<b>It's getting more dramatic

<b>Before we secure

00:23:48,867 --> 00:23:50,514
<b>I'm sorry I let you go
just like that.</b>

307
00:23:51,711 --> 00:23:55,305
<b>I knew you were acting unusual.</b>

308
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:57,505
<b>I knew it,</b>

309
00:23:57,679 --> 00:23:59,120
<b>but I still sent you off.</b>

310
00:24:00,219 --> 00:24:03,039
<b>It's not that I didn't know.
I acted like I didn't.</b>

311
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:06,865
<b>I'm sorry, Eun Ho.</b>

312
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,055
<b>Ko Eun Ho.</b>

313
00:24:10,773 --> 00:24:14,191
<b>I'm leaving your side now...</b>

314
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:18,179
<b>to protect you.</b>

315
00:24:19,195 --> 00:24:22,957
<b>It's not to catch the culprit who
killed Soo Jung but to protect you.</b>

316
00:24:23,297 --> 00:24:24,297
<b>And...</b>

317
00:24:26,141 --> 00:24:27,860
<b>to protect myself.</b>

318
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,579
<b>There's someone...</b>

319
00:24:36,961 --> 00:24:38,665
<b>who took responsibility
for my wrongdoing.</b>

320
00:24:40,202 --> 00:24:42,706
<b>It's not just you,
but I'm also being protected.</b>

321
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:44,027
<b>You protected me...</b>

322
00:24:45,226 --> 00:24:46,986
<b>just like I did.</b>

323
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:50,532
<b>For the past seven years...</b>

324
00:24:50,556 --> 00:24:53,270
<b>It's making me cringe.</b>

325
00:24:58,101 --> 00:24:59,223
<b>When you were little,</b>

326
00:25:00,703 --> 00:25:03,707
<b>you called me a hero
which was quite embarrassing.</b>

327
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,833
<b>I'm not a kid anymore.</b>

328
00:25:06,469 --> 00:25:07,948
<b>You're still a kid.</b>

329
00:25:07,972 --> 00:25:09,589
<b>You're only 15.</b>

330
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:14,549
<b>Do you want
to become an adult quickly?</b>

331
00:25:14,573 --> 00:25:15,895
<b>No.</b>

332
00:25:17,117 --> 00:25:18,696
<b>I want to take my time.</b>

333
00:25:19,898 --> 00:25:21,490
<b>It's not so bad right now.</b>

334
00:25:47,812 --> 00:25:50,628
<b>What's the market price
shown on the graph?</b>

335
00:25:50,652 --> 00:25:52,577
<b>- It's 1 dollar and 50 cents.
- Then...</b>

<b>two,</b>

<b>one.</b>

340
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:10,406
<b>Baek Sang Ho!</b>

341
00:26:27,665 --> 00:26:28,665
<b>Wait.</b>

342
00:26:29,836 --> 00:26:32,179
<b>Why don't we talk in your car?</b>

343
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:33,570
<b>Get in.</b>

344
00:26:37,734 --> 00:26:41,329
<b>Goodness, nice bag.</b>

345
00:26:41,937 --> 00:26:43,079
<b>What brand is it?</b>

346
00:26:49,453 --> 00:26:50,453
<b>Sun Woo.</b>

347
00:26:51,031 --> 00:26:52,086
<b>This.</b>

348
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,711
<b>Whose is this?</b>

349
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:56,665
<b>Why do you ask?</b>

350
00:26:56,689 --> 00:26:59,379
<b>I have a book I need to get back
from Pastor Kwon Jae Chun.</b>

351
00:26:59,403 --> 00:27:00,867
<b>I think this is it.</b>

352
00:27:01,023 --> 00:27:03,349
<b>Where did you get this?</b>

353
00:27:04,382 --> 00:27:07,875
<b>Eun Ho's classmates took it
from his locker and hid it.</b>

354
00:27:07,899 --> 00:27:08,899
<b>Really?</b>

00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:13,570
<b>("New Life Gospel")</b>

356
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:17,725
<b>That means it's mine.</b>

00:27:18,508 --> 00:27:19,508
<b>I'll get going.</b>

358
00:27:25,437 --> 00:27:26,437
<b>Oh, right.</b>

359
00:27:28,187 --> 00:27:29,640
<b>Have you read it?</b>

360
00:27:31,367 --> 00:27:33,733
<b>I've never read mine either.</b>

361
00:27:34,641 --> 00:27:35,641
<b>I see.</b>

362
00:27:36,164 --> 00:27:37,462
<b>You were an exception.</b>

363
00:27:37,953 --> 00:27:39,548
<b>We needed to memorize this...</b>

364

366
00:27:46,437 --> 00:27:47,523
<b>I didn't know.</b>

367
00:27:47,547 --> 00:27:49,414
<b>You just have to keep
living like that.</b>

<b>Not knowing anything,

370
00:28:30,027 --> 00:28:31,050
<b>Mr. Lee.</b>

371
00:28:38,953 --> 00:28:41,473
<b>- What's with the empty desks?

372
00:28:41,497 --> 00:28:44,366
<b>- I know.
- Come on.</b>

373
00:28:44,695 --> 00:28:45,919
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

374
00:28:47,453 --> 00:28:48,999
<b>What's wrong, Mr. Lee?</b>

375
00:28:49,023 --> 00:28:51,466
<b>Did something happen to Eun Ho?</b>

376
00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:53,040
<b>Eun Ho is fine.</b>

377
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:55,089
<b>Then what's wrong?</b>

378
00:28:55,113 --> 00:28:56,113
<b>It's just that...</b>

379
00:28:58,734 --> 00:29:00,516
<b>I came so late,</b>

380
00:29:03,516 --> 00:29:05,490
<b>but you waited for me.
I'm grateful for it.</b>

381
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:07,840
<b>Mr. Lee.</b>

382
00:29:08,922 --> 00:29:10,491
<b>Mr. Lee, this is so corny.</b>

383
00:29:10,515 --> 00:29:12,339
<b>Okay.</b>

384
00:29:31,367 --> 00:29:33,049
<b>Mr. Lee wanted me
to hand this to you.</b>

385
00:29:33,656 --> 00:29:36,317
<b>He took the original book
back to school.</b>

386
00:29:36,804 --> 00:29:39,142
<b>Thank you so much.
It must not have been easy for you.</b>

387
00:29:39,976 --> 00:29:42,821
<b>Because I trust you, Ms. Cha.</b>

388
00:29:44,312 --> 00:29:47,125
<b>I've watched you
as I was nursing Eun Ho.</b>

389
00:29:47,961 --> 00:29:49,972
<b>He wasn't related or anything,</b>

390
00:29:49,996 --> 00:29:52,648
<b>but you were so affectionate
and devoted to him.</b>

391
00:29:53,758 --> 00:29:56,702
<b>I was fascinated and envious of him.</b>

392
00:29:57,508 --> 00:29:58,988
<b>What I mean is,</b>

393
00:29:59,013 --> 00:30:02,285
<b>this is not doing
Lee Sun Woo a favor.</b>

394
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,979
<b>It's helping Cha Young Jin.</b>

395
00:30:05,812 --> 00:30:07,383
<b>Eun Ho and I...</b>

396
00:30:09,281 --> 00:30:11,290
<b>have known each other
for seven years.</b>

397
00:30:13,312 --> 00:30:14,312
<b>Bye.</b>

398
00:30:20,765 --> 00:30:23,445
<b>Why don't you give Mr. Lee
another chance?</b>

399
00:30:26,007 --> 00:30:28,550
<b>I hit him in front of other kids.</b>

400
00:30:29,694 --> 00:30:32,972
<b>I'm not in a position
to give him a chance.</b>

401
00:30:33,608 --> 00:30:35,524
<b>You were still a kid back then.</b>

402
00:30:37,445 --> 00:30:39,167
<b>Make up with him
before you grow any older.</b>

403
00:31:02,101 --> 00:31:03,218
<b>Yes. Did you get it?</b>

404
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:05,004
<b>I did.</b>

405
00:31:06,781 --> 00:31:09,191
<b>- Are you okay?
- They took it away from me.</b>

406
00:31:09,424 --> 00:31:12,094
<b>Be careful of Baek Sang Ho. And tell
the same thing to Tae Hyung.</b>

407
00:31:12,394 --> 00:31:15,030
<b>- You should be careful too.
- Okay. I'll call you later.</b>

408
00:31:17,914 --> 00:31:18,967
<b>Hello?</b>

409
00:31:20,062 --> 00:31:21,164
<b>Okay. I'll be waiting.</b>

410
00:31:41,507 --> 00:31:43,164
<b>I don't know him.</b>

411
00:31:46,948 --> 00:31:48,385
<b>Not this guy either.</b>

412
00:31:48,432 --> 00:31:51,301
<b>Am I supposed to recognize them?</b>

413
00:31:51,325 --> 00:31:55,437
<b>No. If you do, that means
we're on the wrong track.</b>

414
00:31:59,921 --> 00:32:01,643
<b>Have you seen this guy?</b>

415
00:32:02,273 --> 00:32:03,311
<b>Yes.</b>

416
00:32:04,117 --> 00:32:06,117
<b>- When?
- On the day before I fell,</b>

417
00:32:07,828 --> 00:32:10,319
<b>I was on my way to meet Han Sol,</b>

418
00:32:10,388 --> 00:32:12,564
<b>he turned up out of nowhere
and snatched my backpack.</b>

419
00:32:12,588 --> 00:32:16,291
<b>Then, why didn't you call
the police? Do you remember?</b>

420
00:32:17,343 --> 00:32:19,227
<b>Is it because of the money
you'd been hiding?</b>

421
00:32:20,929 --> 00:32:22,230
<b>That's partly right.</b>

422
00:32:22,431 --> 00:32:26,134
<b>But I thought it could've been
Min Sung's driver...</b>

423
00:32:26,476 --> 00:32:27,669
<b>because the answer sheet...</b>

424
00:32:28,351 --> 00:32:30,937
<b>for the exam that Min Sung gave me
was saved on my phone.</b>

425
00:32:39,812 --> 00:32:41,583
<b>Do you think you can continue?</b>

426
00:32:42,084 --> 00:32:43,762
<b>- Yes.
- Let's do it later.</b>

427
00:32:43,786 --> 00:32:46,521
<b>We should check the security footage
of the motorbike first.</b>

428
00:32:47,961 --> 00:32:48,961
<b>Sure.</b>

429
00:32:56,194 --> 00:32:59,171
<b>- It must be very hard.
- It's nothing compared to Eun Ho.</b>

430
00:32:59,801 --> 00:33:02,504
<b>There's nothing I can do for him
as his mom,</b>

431
00:33:03,031 --> 00:33:05,101
<b>and that's what breaks my heart.</b>

432
00:33:06,711 --> 00:33:10,846
<b>By the way, can you give me
the number of Min Sung's mom?</b>

433
00:33:11,193 --> 00:33:14,816
<b>- That would be...
- Then, call her for me...</b>

434
00:33:17,445 --> 00:33:19,445
<b>and tell her
that I want to meet her.</b>

435
00:33:20,374 --> 00:33:22,374
<b>Tell her to come to my house then.</b>

436
00:33:51,812 --> 00:33:53,461
<b>I'm not for sale.</b>

437
00:33:53,682 --> 00:33:54,535
<b>Pardon?</b>

438
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:57,257
<b>Don't look me over from head to toe
as if you're appraising my value.</b>

439
00:33:57,281 --> 00:33:59,671
<b>I'm sorry, but we should meet
again later.</b>

440
00:33:59,695 --> 00:34:04,143
<b>I am afraid you might take
everything I say...</b>

441
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:05,344
<b>emotionally.</b>

442
00:34:05,368 --> 00:34:07,145
<b>So you don't get it at all.</b>

443
00:34:07,169 --> 00:34:09,337
<b>- Sorry?
- I'm a human.</b>

444
00:34:12,617 --> 00:34:13,842
<b>A human with emotions.</b>

445
00:34:14,309 --> 00:34:16,968
<b>My son had to go through
such a horrible thing...</b>

446
00:34:16,992 --> 00:34:20,882
<b>because of your son. Of course,
it hurts and infuriates me.</b>

447
00:34:30,089 --> 00:34:31,960
<b>- Leave the living room.
- Come have a seat.</b>

448
00:34:36,492 --> 00:34:38,777
<b>Why did you show the answers
to Eun Ho?</b>

449
00:34:38,801 --> 00:34:40,268
<b>I wanted to make up with him.</b>

450
00:34:40,569 --> 00:34:42,214
<b>Then, why did you
have your driver...</b>

451
00:34:42,238 --> 00:34:43,982
<b>scare Eun Ho in such a place?</b>

452
00:34:44,006 --> 00:34:46,775
<b>- Enough.
- How can I possibly forgive you?</b>

453
00:34:51,686 --> 00:34:53,682
<b>- Please don't.
- What?</b>

454
00:34:53,805 --> 00:34:55,684
<b>Eun Ho got injured and Uncle died...</b>

455
00:34:57,250 --> 00:34:58,653
<b>because of me.</b>

456
00:34:59,789 --> 00:35:01,468
<b>I would never forgive me
if I were you.</b>

457
00:35:01,492 --> 00:35:04,265
<b>So, are you not going to apologize
to me?</b>

458
00:35:04,775 --> 00:35:05,775
<b>Can I?</b>

459
00:35:10,232 --> 00:35:11,566
<b>I don't know what to do either.</b>

460
00:35:13,148 --> 00:35:15,236
<b>But that's the only thing
you can do.</b>

461
00:35:25,818 --> 00:35:28,550
<b>- Get home safely.
- Okay.</b>

462
00:35:29,671 --> 00:35:31,253
<b>I'll come visit you in prison.</b>

463
00:35:36,874 --> 00:35:38,693
<b>How lucky we are.</b>

464
00:35:39,361 --> 00:35:41,031
<b>We, moms, are messed up,</b>

465
00:35:41,335 --> 00:35:43,335
<b>but our kids are kind.</b>

466
00:36:14,329 --> 00:36:15,897
<b>Good afternoon, sir.</b>

467
00:36:17,281 --> 00:36:18,281
<b>Mr. Han.</b>

468
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,502
<b>Are you really Eun Ho?</b>

469
00:36:20,602 --> 00:36:22,180
<b>You're a big boy now.</b>

470
00:36:22,204 --> 00:36:24,816
<b>I wouldn't be able to recognize you
if I run into you somewhere else.</b>

471
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,341
<b>But I would.</b>

472
00:36:33,859 --> 00:36:36,899
<b>I can't believe I haven't seen you
for such a long time.</b>

473
00:36:37,609 --> 00:36:39,955
<b>We should see more often
with Dong Myung and Min Sung.</b>

474
00:36:40,696 --> 00:36:43,058
<b>- How do you know them?
- Well,</b>

475
00:36:44,984 --> 00:36:48,964
<b>Min Sung got in trouble at school,</b>

476
00:36:49,164 --> 00:36:50,875
<b>and Dong Myung was there too.</b>

477
00:36:51,499 --> 00:36:55,003
<b>- I was in charge of it.
- I want to know what happened.</b>

478
00:37:02,477 --> 00:37:04,713
<b>If Min Sung had kept his mouth shut
to the end,</b>

479
00:37:05,046 --> 00:37:07,742
<b>Dong Myung would've taken
all the blame.</b>

480
00:37:07,916 --> 00:37:12,652
<b>But he confessed that
he hurt himself later.</b>

481
00:37:21,244 --> 00:37:23,732
<b>- Hello.
- Hey. Nice to see you again.</b>

482
00:37:25,796 --> 00:37:26,868
<b>Me too.</b>

483
00:37:31,632 --> 00:37:34,309
<b>- What's wrong with him?
- What do you mean?</b>

484
00:37:34,342 --> 00:37:36,377
<b>He looks serious.</b>

485
00:37:37,656 --> 00:37:39,825
<b>Dong Myung, call Min Sung.</b>

486
00:37:39,849 --> 00:37:40,929
<b>Do you want me to call him?</b>

487
00:37:42,296 --> 00:37:43,268
<b>I don't have his number.</b>

488
00:37:43,292 --> 00:37:45,841
<b>You went to work together.
How come you don't have his number?</b>

489
00:37:48,078 --> 00:37:50,592
<b>His mom came to school
and created a scene today,</b>

490
00:37:50,784 --> 00:37:52,527
<b>so he must be in an awful mood.</b>

491
00:37:52,994 --> 00:37:54,596
<b>Make a call...</b>

492
00:37:55,397 --> 00:37:57,665
<b>and tell him to come if he wants to.</b>

493
00:38:41,009 --> 00:38:43,044
<b>Han Sol's surgery went well.</b>

494
00:38:49,476 --> 00:38:50,562
<b>Please come in.</b>

495
00:39:01,496 --> 00:39:03,131
<b>Did you guys make up already?</b>

496
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:06,378
<b>It was nothing after all.</b>

497
00:39:06,402 --> 00:39:07,913
<b>What did you expect?</b>

498
00:39:07,937 --> 00:39:10,171
<b>When he was with me,
he hit his forehead...</b>

499
00:39:14,442 --> 00:39:15,679
<b>Never mind.</b>

500
00:39:15,703 --> 00:39:17,252
<b>Will all of you three be studying
in the same classroom...</b>

501
00:39:17,276 --> 00:39:19,089
<b>after Eun Ho is discharged?</b>

502
00:39:20,445 --> 00:39:21,816
<b>That'd be exciting.</b>

503
00:39:23,804 --> 00:39:28,423
<b>The case Eun Ho and Dong Myung
are involved in is dropped.</b>

504
00:39:30,425 --> 00:39:33,094
<b>What's important is not to repeat
the same mistake.</b>

505
00:39:33,228 --> 00:39:34,295
<b>Okay?</b>

506
00:39:34,565 --> 00:39:37,098
<b>And someone else will be in charge
of you guys from now on.</b>

507
00:39:37,198 --> 00:39:39,500
<b>- Why?
- I got fired.</b>

508
00:39:45,578 --> 00:39:47,778
<b>Even I'm trying to put up with it
not to get kicked out.</b>

509
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:50,455
<b>Should we work part-time together?</b>

510
00:39:50,479 --> 00:39:54,025
<b>I plan to give a helping hand
to my friend's farm.</b>

511
00:39:54,049 --> 00:39:55,650
<b>You can work only during weekends.</b>

512
00:39:55,884 --> 00:39:57,169
<b>- You'll be paid handsomely.</b>

513
00:39:57,193 --> 00:39:59,920
<b>It's a job offered
by a former police officer.</b>

514
00:40:00,464 --> 00:40:01,765
<b>It can't be so bad.</b>

515
00:40:10,302 --> 00:40:12,433
<b>("New Life Gospel")</b>

516
00:40:26,806 --> 00:40:28,349
<b>Shall we begin?</b>

517
00:40:29,461 --> 00:40:30,461
<b>Let's see.</b>

518
00:40:50,605 --> 00:40:51,785
<b>- This is it, right?
- It's "oh."</b>

519
00:40:51,809 --> 00:40:53,084
<b>- Write it down.
- "Oh."</b>

520
00:40:53,109 --> 00:40:55,009
<b>- Which page is it?
- It's on page 105.</b>

521
00:40:55,844 --> 00:40:57,789
<b>- Focus, Hee Dong.
- Yes.</b>

522
00:41:09,891 --> 00:41:12,427
<b>"I'm walking down the road."</b>

523
00:41:12,948 --> 00:41:13,948
<b>It's the end.</b>

524
00:41:14,398 --> 00:41:15,569
<b>- Did you find it?
- Yes.</b>

525
00:41:15,593 --> 00:41:16,831
<b>Give me that.</b>

526
00:41:19,304 --> 00:41:20,745
<b>- They're numbers.
- They are.</b>

527
00:41:20,769 --> 00:41:22,003
<b>Twenty.</b>

528
00:41:22,281 --> 00:41:24,439
<b>- Twenty-one numbers.
- It's 21 numbers.</b>

529
00:41:26,241 --> 00:41:27,475
<b>What are these?</b>

530
00:41:27,742 --> 00:41:28,943
<b>What could they be?</b>

531
00:41:31,250 --> 00:41:34,749
<b>Sun Ah, come here.</b>

532
00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:37,395
<b>Hey, it's your turn.</b>

533
00:41:37,419 --> 00:41:39,320
<b>This is exactly...</b>

534
00:41:39,437 --> 00:41:42,190
<b>why I sent you
to a prestigious university.</b>

535
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:47,226
<b>- The numbers are meaningless.
- What?</b>

536
00:41:47,251 --> 00:41:49,597
<b>It's useless
unless we know what they mean.</b>

537
00:41:49,964 --> 00:41:51,599
<b>- What about this?
- What?</b>

538
00:41:51,976 --> 00:41:53,734
<b>How they use numbers
to locate something.</b>

539
00:41:53,758 --> 00:41:55,914
<b>There are numbers
like this and this.</b>

540
00:41:55,938 --> 00:41:57,453
<b>I think he means
the latitude and longitude.</b>

541
00:41:57,477 --> 00:42:00,408
<b>- The latitude and longitude.
- You need 17 numbers for that.</b>

542
00:42:01,375 --> 00:42:02,953
<b>Won't the rest of the four numbers
be the passcode?</b>

543
00:42:02,977 --> 00:42:05,213
<b>Even if you're right,</b>

544
00:42:05,238 --> 00:42:08,092
<b>we don't know the pattern to come up
with the latitude and longitude.</b>

545
00:42:08,436 --> 00:42:10,644
<b>There will be
a ton of possibilities.</b>

546
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:12,186
<b>You're right.</b>

547
00:42:12,702 --> 00:42:14,492
<b>So we need Jang Ki Ho after all.</b>

548
00:42:17,692 --> 00:42:18,860
<b>Find Ki Ho.</b>

549
00:42:21,629 --> 00:42:22,807
<b>What is this reaction?</b>

550
00:42:22,831 --> 00:42:24,765
<b>I'm not asking you to find
a dead person.</b>

551
00:42:24,789 --> 00:42:26,911
<b>- Cha Young Jin hid him.
- She doesn't have the gospel.</b>

552
00:42:26,935 --> 00:42:29,971
<b>What do you think Ki Ho will do
if he finds out we have the gospel?</b>

553
00:42:30,571 --> 00:42:32,384
<b>The moment you imply the incident...</b>

554
00:42:32,408 --> 00:42:34,142
<b>No.</b>

555
00:42:34,242 --> 00:42:36,102
<b>That would never happen.
I guarantee you...</b>

556
00:42:36,126 --> 00:42:39,047
<b>- that Pastor Kwon never told him.
- Sang Ho.</b>

557
00:42:43,718 --> 00:42:44,829
<b>Let's get rid of the gospel.</b>

558
00:42:44,853 --> 00:42:47,121
<b>No one will be able to find it
without the gospel.</b>

559
00:42:47,255 --> 00:42:48,423
<b>You're right.</b>

560
00:42:49,859 --> 00:42:51,659
<b>And neither can I.</b>

561
00:42:53,461 --> 00:42:55,718
<b>The gospel is in my hands.</b>

562
00:42:55,742 --> 00:42:57,108
<b>All we need is Ki Ho.</b>

563
00:42:57,132 --> 00:42:58,800
<b>If only we have Ki Ho...</b>

564
00:43:02,436 --> 00:43:03,671
<b>Why am I doing this?</b>

565
00:43:04,218 --> 00:43:05,218
<b>Why?</b>

566
00:43:05,674 --> 00:43:08,943
<b>Because there's a threat
that will knock me down?</b>

567
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:11,256
<b>No, it's not.</b>

568
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:12,447
<b>Can't you see?</b>

569
00:43:14,749 --> 00:43:15,850
<b>That is...</b>

570
00:43:17,093 --> 00:43:19,120
<b>a piece of my soul...</b>

571
00:43:20,491 --> 00:43:22,190
<b>that made me who I am now.</b>

572
00:43:37,789 --> 00:43:40,374
<b>- Where's my book?
- In my backpack.</b>

573
00:43:42,765 --> 00:43:43,989
<b>Give me the bag.</b>

574
00:43:44,013 --> 00:43:45,813
<b>I'm fine. Let's get up there.</b>

575
00:44:06,959 --> 00:44:08,169
<b>Doo Seok.</b>

576
00:44:09,007 --> 00:44:10,304
<b>Do you have anything to tell me?</b>

577
00:44:10,671 --> 00:44:13,674
<b>Sang Ho, the situation isn't
looking too good.</b>

578
00:44:13,941 --> 00:44:16,310
<b>Eun Ho woke up,
and he'll regain his memory soon.</b>

579
00:44:16,528 --> 00:44:18,640
<b>I wish we'd stop making this
riskier than it is.</b>

580
00:44:18,664 --> 00:44:20,366
<b>Do you? And Hee Dong?</b>

581
00:44:20,390 --> 00:44:22,382
<b>What? Me?</b>

582
00:44:24,492 --> 00:44:25,853
<b>I think...</b>

583
00:44:28,222 --> 00:44:30,658
<b>We're here thanks to Sang Ho, right?</b>

584
00:44:30,925 --> 00:44:32,036
<b>I'm doing it if you want me to.</b>

585
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:33,571
<b>- Manager Oh.
- Yes?</b>

586
00:44:33,595 --> 00:44:35,807
<b>Didn't you get the notice

<b>- to the SCS tomorrow?

588
00:44:37,733 --> 00:44:40,334
<b>What do you think?
It's about Eun Ho's fall.</b>

589
00:44:41,030 --> 00:44:43,890
<b>It'll be all right.
Just answer as you practiced.</b>

590
00:44:43,914 --> 00:44:45,439
<b>The problem is Doo Seok.</b>

591
00:44:45,515 --> 00:44:47,408
<b>When Eun Ho regains his memory,</b>

592

- Did Eun Ho see one of us...</b>

594

<b>hanging Dae Hoon?</b>

595
00:44:58,544 --> 00:45:01,355
<b>As long as you trust me

596
00:45:01,856 --> 00:45:03,558

597
00:45:08,129 --> 00:45:09,964
<b>- How are we going to catch Ki Ho?
- Doo Seok.</b>

598
00:45:10,331 --> 00:45:12,143
<b>Go to Cha Young Jin's old house.</b>

599

<b>Do you seriously think

<b>There could be a clue

- Where is my book right now?</b>

611
00:46:33,070 --> 00:46:35,449
<b>Don't tell me Sang Ho has it.</b>

612
00:46:37,593 --> 00:46:39,020
<b>Did you need the book itself,</b>

613
00:46:40,250 --> 00:46:41,956
<b>not the contents?</b>

614
00:46:42,525 --> 00:46:44,296
<b>That's not it.</b>

615
00:46:44,792 --> 00:46:47,495
<b>That means only you can find
the answer, doesn't it?</b>

616
00:47:01,342 --> 00:47:02,977
<b>Is the transcript correct?</b>

617
00:47:03,277 --> 00:47:04,277
<b>Yes.</b>

618

<b>Yoo Pan Sool's phone is turned off.</b>

<b>Please tell him to give me a call
when you see him.</b>

620
00:47:21,429 --> 00:47:23,597
<b>Come to think of it,
I haven't seen him for a few days.</b>

621
00:47:23,864 --> 00:47:26,233
<b>Your colleague was absent
for more than a day.</b>

622
00:47:26,334 --> 00:47:28,012
<b>Didn't you try to reach him?</b>

623
00:47:28,036 --> 00:47:30,081
<b>He probably sold his land
and went somewhere nice.</b>

624
00:47:30,105 --> 00:47:32,016
<b>Pardon me? What do you mean?</b>

625
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:34,252
<b>He'd been so happy lately
saying that he got a chance...</b>

626
00:47:34,276 --> 00:47:35,910
<b>to sell his land for a good price.</b>

627
00:47:36,210 --> 00:47:38,194
<b>Why don't you check it at his home?</b>

628
00:47:38,218 --> 00:47:41,749
<b>Anyway, please give us a call

<b>(Kim Byung Hee)</b>

<b>You can ask me now.</b>

632
00:47:50,906 --> 00:47:53,995
<b>Have you seen Yoo Pan Sool
in his house these few days?</b>

633
00:47:55,329 --> 00:47:57,698
<b>Now that I think about it,
it was a bit quiet.</b>

634
00:47:58,032 --> 00:47:59,577
<b>Every time he brushed his teeth,</b>

635
00:47:59,601 --> 00:48:01,902
<b>he used to gag
like he was vomiting his organs.</b>

636
00:48:01,936 --> 00:48:03,604
<b>But I didn't hear him do that
lately.</b>

637
00:48:03,799 --> 00:48:06,991
<b>I saw that there weren't
any parking spaces.</b>

638
00:48:07,015 --> 00:48:08,296
<b>Where does he park his truck?</b>

639
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:11,923
<b>Turn right at the end of this alley
and walk down the main road.</b>

640
00:48:11,947 --> 00:48:13,547
<b>Then you'll see his shop.</b>

641
00:48:13,748 --> 00:48:15,793
<b>He parks on the road in front of it.</b>

642
00:48:15,817 --> 00:48:17,385
<b>- Thank you.
- Sure.</b>

643
00:48:23,492 --> 00:48:24,235
<b>Wait.</b>

<b>(Tow notice)</b>

<b>he's not even going to church

<b>he's not at home,</b>

649
00:48:32,968 --> 00:48:36,003
<b>his truck was towed,

650

<b>Where on earth is he?</b>

651
00:48:40,374 --> 00:48:42,353
<b>Should we go to his land?</b>

652
00:48:42,377 --> 00:48:45,297
<b>He could be in the container
where Jang Ki Ho used to hide.</b>

653
00:48:45,321 --> 00:48:48,382
<b>He wouldn't be there.
He doesn't have his truck.</b>

654
00:48:49,249 --> 00:48:50,572
<b>So you're saying you won't go?</b>

655
00:48:51,734 --> 00:48:53,093
<b>When did I say I won't?</b>

656
00:48:53,587 --> 00:48:54,987
<b>I only said that he won't be there.</b>

657
00:48:55,122 --> 00:48:57,068
<b>- I think he will.
- Do you?</b>

658
00:48:57,092 --> 00:48:58,926
<b>Why don't the loser buy beef?</b>

659
00:48:59,169 --> 00:49:00,972
<b>- It's a deal.
- It's a deal.</b>

660
00:49:00,996 --> 00:49:02,129
<b>Don't you...</b>

661
00:49:02,238 --> 00:49:05,166
<b>dare buy me a burger

<b>Did you hear me?</b>

663

<b>(In the midst of glory...)</b>

664
00:49:40,699 --> 00:49:42,580
<b>Mr. Yoo Pan Sool, are you in there?</b>

665
00:49:42,604 --> 00:49:45,139
<b>It's the police.
Are you in there, Mr. Yoo Pan Sool?</b>

666
00:50:09,741 --> 00:50:11,569
<b>I want prime beef.</b>

667
00:50:16,570 --> 00:50:19,607
<b>I wonder who tried to buy this land
at such a good price.</b>

668
00:50:24,078 --> 00:50:25,078
<b>He's out again.</b>

669
00:50:26,687 --> 00:50:28,282
<b>We better check
on Yoon Hee Seob too.</b>

670
00:50:28,703 --> 00:50:30,261
<b>If we lose trace of him here,</b>

671
00:50:30,285 --> 00:50:31,329
<b>doesn't it mean he's missing?</b>

672
00:50:31,353 --> 00:50:34,088
<b>He has neither family nor friends.</b>

673
00:50:34,321 --> 00:50:35,623
<b>I guess you're right.</b>

674
00:50:40,741 --> 00:50:43,841
<b>Hello, Ms. Hong. Did you get
the last location of his phone?</b>

675
00:50:43,865 --> 00:50:45,232
<b>It's Highway 48.</b>

676
00:50:45,461 --> 00:50:47,905
<b>- I'll send you the address.
- Okay, thank you.</b>

677
00:50:48,867 --> 00:50:51,639
<b>- Where is it?
- Let me see.</b>

678
00:50:52,573 --> 00:50:53,741
<b>It's nearby.</b>

679
00:50:58,241 --> 00:51:00,881
<b>Where are you going?</b>

680
00:51:02,750 --> 00:51:04,151
<b>What are you going to do with that?</b>

681
00:51:04,919 --> 00:51:07,454
<b>- We need to find him.
- Is this because of beef?</b>

682
00:51:08,461 --> 00:51:11,525
<b>We would've known where he is
if we hadn't gotten caught tailing.</b>

683
00:51:11,632 --> 00:51:12,660
<b>Let's go.</b>

684
00:51:14,017 --> 00:51:15,262
<b>What's with that face?</b>

685
00:51:15,459 --> 00:51:16,906
<b>This work doesn't suit you, does it?</b>

686
00:51:16,930 --> 00:51:20,711
<b>I guarantee you'll work in this team
until the day you retire.</b>

687
00:51:20,735 --> 00:51:23,103
<b>Do you want to jinx it or what?</b>

688
00:51:25,172 --> 00:51:27,207
<b>- How about we do that together?
- No, thanks.</b>

689
00:51:27,466 --> 00:51:30,277
<b>I already settled down
in Felony Crime Team.</b>

690
00:51:31,979 --> 00:51:35,449
<b>Let's please not meet here, old man.</b>

691
00:51:44,312 --> 00:51:47,227
<b>Angels are changed to messengers.
Is it number four this time?</b>

692
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:53,000
<b>It wouldn't be hard if this was
only about finding numbers.</b>

693
00:51:53,821 --> 00:51:56,414
<b>Even if people read this book
and find the numbers,</b>

694
00:51:56,438 --> 00:51:58,683
<b>it wouldn't be of use to them.</b>

695
00:51:58,707 --> 00:51:59,974
<b>To them,</b>

696
00:52:00,140 --> 00:52:03,143
<b>it's just numbers
listed in disorder.</b>

697
00:52:06,087 --> 00:52:07,087
<b>Ms. Cha.</b>

698
00:52:09,533 --> 00:52:13,312
<b>A total of 21 words are different
from the original copy.</b>

699
00:52:14,087 --> 00:52:15,447
<b>But they have one thing in common.</b>

700
00:52:15,688 --> 00:52:17,156
<b>Within those words,</b>

701
00:52:17,390 --> 00:52:18,725
<b>there are numbers.</b>

702
00:52:18,925 --> 00:52:21,549
<b>Unless Jang Ki Ho has
another way to solve this.</b>

703
00:52:21,573 --> 00:52:22,970
<b>But if he especially wanted
that book.</b>

704
00:52:22,994 --> 00:52:24,025
<b>That means, the answer must start...</b>

705
00:52:24,049 --> 00:52:26,089
<b>from those 21 words
whatever the case is.</b>

706
00:52:34,017 --> 00:52:35,603
<b>(From the Genesis until now...)</b>

707
00:52:41,188 --> 00:52:43,716
<b>- There are 21 of them.
- Right.</b>

708
00:52:44,260 --> 00:52:47,587
<b>These numbers represent
that the world is full of sin.</b>

709
00:52:47,954 --> 00:52:50,156
<b>Is this how you see the world?</b>

710
00:52:52,135 --> 00:52:53,526
<b>To me,</b>

711
00:52:54,533 --> 00:52:56,053
<b>twenty-one is
Eun Ho's favorite number.</b>

712
00:52:56,262 --> 00:52:58,008
<b>Why does he like that number?</b>

713
00:52:58,032 --> 00:53:00,633
<b>When he was little, he counted
the teeth of a bottle cap...</b>

714
00:53:00,969 --> 00:53:02,268
<b>and said it was 21.</b>

715
00:53:03,169 --> 00:53:05,915
<b>He counted the teeth every time
he saw a bottle cap since then.</b>

716
00:53:05,939 --> 00:53:07,717
<b>Then he figured out...</b>

717
00:53:07,741 --> 00:53:10,043
<b>that every bottle cap has 21 teeth.</b>

718
00:53:10,443 --> 00:53:11,511
<b>That's why...</b>

719
00:53:12,211 --> 00:53:14,133
<b>he likes that number.</b>

720
00:53:14,714 --> 00:53:17,884
<b>It doesn't need a special reason
to like something.</b>

721
00:53:20,562 --> 00:53:22,055
<b>Once this is over,</b>

722
00:53:22,898 --> 00:53:24,290
<b>let me meet Eun Ho.</b>

723
00:53:24,589 --> 00:53:26,336
<b>Is it because he saved your life?</b>

724
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:28,261
<b>Do I need any other reason?</b>

725
00:53:29,562 --> 00:53:32,375
<b>If we leave now, we might arrive
at the break of dawn.</b>

726
00:53:32,399 --> 00:53:33,399
<b>Let's go.</b>

727
00:53:51,451 --> 00:53:54,787
<b>There may be something else
other than what will bring...</b>

728
00:53:55,121 --> 00:53:56,756
<b>Baek Sang Ho down.</b>

729
00:53:57,757 --> 00:53:59,959
<b>Whatever it is, it will all be mine.</b>

730
00:54:00,618 --> 00:54:02,149
<b>Promise me.</b>

731
00:54:02,762 --> 00:54:03,963
<b>I can't do that.</b>

732
00:54:05,148 --> 00:54:07,367
<b>I'll let you have it
if you can prove it belongs to you.</b>

733
00:54:12,464 --> 00:54:15,408
<b>Right,
I wouldn't have trusted you...</b>

734

<b>if you had accepted my demand.</b>

735
00:54:18,782 --> 00:54:19,812
<b>Let's go.</b>

<b>Hey, no! Move.</b>

<b>Check this out.

<b>- Two o'clock from here.

<b>What about the car?</b>

749
00:55:46,005 --> 00:55:47,657
<b>I parked it nearby and walked here.</b>

<b>You're going through so much.</b>

751

761
00:57:17,089 --> 00:57:20,626
<b>Turn right a little while later
and you'll see a New Life Church.</b>

762
00:57:20,878 --> 00:57:23,896
<b>Those numbers indicate more than
the church, right?</b>

763
00:57:25,535 --> 00:57:27,343
<b>I can show you the way,</b>

764
00:57:27,367 --> 00:57:29,869
<b>but I can't tell you how.</b>

765
00:57:30,436 --> 00:57:33,372
<b>It's Pastor Kwon's gift given
only to us.</b>

766
00:57:35,238 --> 00:57:37,043
<b>You should turn right soon.</b>

767
00:57:43,649 --> 00:57:46,352
<b>"I tell you the truth,"</b>

768

<b>"but my words will never pass away."</b>

772
00:57:57,263 --> 00:58:00,232
<b>"No one knows
about that day or hour,"</b>

773
00:58:02,847 --> 00:58:04,282
<b>"not even the angels in heaven..."</b>

774

<b>"Not even the messengers

<b>"nor the Son,"</b>

<b>"but only the Father."</b>

<b>("New Life Gospel")</b>

779
00:58:56,722 --> 00:58:58,722
<b>There isn't any church here.</b>

780
00:59:01,227 --> 00:59:02,227
<b>No.</b>

781
00:59:09,246 --> 00:59:11,170
<b>- Are you sure about this place?
- It can't be.</b>

782
00:59:13,773 --> 00:59:15,040
<b>Tell me.</b>

783
00:59:15,641 --> 00:59:18,043
<b>- Is this the right place?
- No.</b>

784

<b>This can't be.</b>

785

<b>You're an important testifier

789
00:59:49,376 --> 00:59:50,353
<b>They wouldn't believe you.</b>

790
00:59:50,377 --> 00:59:52,288
<b>Stay away from Baek Sang Ho
for the time being.</b>

791

<b>Don't leave the place provided

<b>Jang Ki Ho.</b>

793
00:59:56,083 --> 00:59:58,027
<b>He might show up on his own...</b>

794
00:59:58,051 --> 01:00:00,163
<b>because he knows I have the book.</b>

795

<b>We're renovating the whole building,
so it's a little chaotic.</b>

<b>This place has nice security.</b>

797

<b>The police will be with you
later at night.</b>

798

<b>Mr. Jang Ki Ho is here?</b>

799
01:00:10,207 --> 01:00:12,375
<b>The owner of my soul was Father.</b>

800
01:00:12,399 --> 01:00:14,700
<b>I want to go back.</b>

01:00:18,605 --> 01:00:19,901
<b>You two, go that way.</b>

802
01:00:19,925 --> 01:00:20,683
<b>- Okay.
- Okay.</b>

803
01:00:20,707 --> 01:00:24,577
<b>You must've found 21 numbers.

<b>Stay away from each other.</b>

806
01:00:28,215 --> 01:00:29,358
<b>Why did you show this to him?</b>

807
01:00:29,382 --> 01:00:33,118
<b>I have been born again.</b>
