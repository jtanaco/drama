<b>I had no idea that you had

305

<b>Mr. Choi, if this is

306

<b>I heard that you're preparing

307
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,359
<b>How did you know?</b>

308
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,885
<b>Please allow us to invest
in your restaurant,</b>

309
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:40,489
<b>and participate in our project in return.</b>

310
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:42,729
<b>- What?
- If you agree to the term,</b>

311
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:47,065
<b>this will be a great win-win
situation for everyone.</b>

312
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,865
<b>Did you stop by the county office
before coming here?</b>

313
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:54,809
<b>We did meet with the county governor</b>

314
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:56,905
<b>to prepare for our business.</b>

315

<b>I see.</b>

316
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:03,275
<b>I guess people at Donghan

317

<b>- What?
[ - Kicking people out as they please ]</b>

318
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:07,755
<b>and helping them out as they please.</b>

319
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:13,085
<b>When a deed is unwanted,
it's all considered rude.</b>

320
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:16,855
<b>Hey, they only want to help!
What's wrong with you?</b>

321
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:19,325
<b>[ We don't have much, anyway. ]</b>

322
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:23,395
<b>I think there's been a misunderstanding.
We only wanted to help.</b>

323
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,665
<b>Isn't it time for the meeting?</b>

324
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:29,405
<b>Excuse me.

<b>I'm sorry you had to come so far for this.</b>

327
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:43,185
<b>Why are they here?</b>

328
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:52,365
<b>Thanks.</b>

329

<b>Thank you all for gathering today.</b>

330
00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:01,039
<b>I wanted to talk about how

<b>Chef Moon? I have a question.</b>

<b>Why are those lads here?</b>

<b>- What?
- They are your guests?</b>

336
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:18,929
<b>Yes, that handsome man over there</b>

337
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:22,429
<b>is the savior who saved us and Bong-doo.</b>

338
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:23,955
<b>What's wrong?</b>

339
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:29,899
<b>We are here because we want to invest
in Chef Moon's restaurant,</b>

340
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,539
<b>so you don't have to worry about us.</b>

341
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:33,735
<b>[ - "Invest"? ]
- Are you sure you're interested?</b>

342
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:36,139
<b>Well, it's all up to Chef Moon,</b>

343
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:38,145
<b>but yes, we are interested in doing so.</b>

344
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:42,415
<b>Isn't it a good thing if a big company
wants to make an investment?</b>

345
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:44,715
<b>But he keeps playing hard to get!</b>

346
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:48,889
<b>He must have other plans, then.</b>

347
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:50,685
<b>- I guess he trusts us a lot.
[ - What? ]</b>

348
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:55,295
<b>[ - Well, we are quite trustworthy. ]
- Be quiet, everyone!</b>

349

<b>Here.</b>

350
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,595
<b>I made the blueprints
for remodeling Chef Moon's house.</b>

351

<b>[ What do you think? ]</b>

352
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:05,135
<b>[ What is it? ]</b>

353
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,635
<b>- Let me see.
- What's this?</b>

354
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:12,205
<b>My goodness,
Byeol-na has a talent for drawing.</b>

355
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:14,315
<b>[ Byeol-na sure is eccentric! ]</b>

356
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:17,785
<b>How did you come up with these drawings?</b>

357
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:21,285
<b>Chef Moon, is this what you wanted?</b>

358
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:24,585
<b>I think this is really great.</b>

359
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:26,655
<b>It doesn't require much construction.</b>

360
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:29,455
<b>We could finish this together
within a short time.</b>

361

<b>- Me too, Byeol-na!
- Sure, okay.</b>

367
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,115
<b>Then Byeol-na will do
the interior decorating.</b>

368
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,589
<b>Then what should we do?</b>

369
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:54,785
<b>I have a special favor to ask of you.</b>

370
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,385
<b>Come up with a menu
using Nonyang's local produce.</b>

<b>This is the most important task.</b>

<b>I don't know if I will be of any help.</b>

<b>This collection in Seoul</b>

<b>is Bella's first collaboration show
in Korea,</b>

393
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:21,109
<b>so she chose Seoul as the theme</b>

394
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:23,205
<b>to show the harmony
between the East and the West</b>

<b>and the modern and the retro sentiment,</b>

<b>Don't you think your company

<b>I'm a businessman, not an artist.</b>

408

<b>I'm only asking since it's hard

<b>The finishing touch is different.</b>
