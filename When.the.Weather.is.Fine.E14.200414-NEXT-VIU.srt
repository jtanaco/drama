00:09:23,132 --> 00:09:24,943
<b>It looks very nice.</b>

161
00:09:26,772 --> 00:09:30,373
<b>Right. The guy who works at City Hall, Jang Woo.</b>

162
00:09:30,373 --> 00:09:34,113
<b>I heard he went on a blind date. I think things are going very well.</b>

163
00:09:34,312 --> 00:09:36,382
<b>- What? He went on a blind date? - Yes.</b>

164
00:09:36,483 --> 00:09:39,083
<b>I heard he might get married next month.</b>

165
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:41,892
<b>What? That's... He might get married?</b>

166
00:09:41,892 --> 00:09:44,892
<b>My, that's great news.</b>

167
00:09:44,892 --> 00:09:46,392
<b>We'll get to eat noodles and rice cakes.</b>

168
00:09:46,392 --> 00:09:48,632
<b>We'll have a feast at the buffet. It's been a while.</b>

169
00:09:48,632 --> 00:09:50,863
<b>Yes! I'd love that.</b>

170
00:09:51,203 --> 00:09:53,162
<b>Eun Sil, are you having fun working at City Hall?</b>

171
00:09:53,162 --> 00:09:54,973
<b>No, it's not fun at all.</b>

172
00:09:54,973 --> 00:09:57,333
<b>- But about that blind date... - Gosh.</b>

173
00:09:57,333 --> 00:09:59,943
<b>Just know that you're very lucky.</b>

174
00:09:59,943 --> 00:10:01,843
<b>Be grateful that you have a job.</b>

175
00:10:02,613 --> 00:10:05,382
<b>- That hurt! - And try to make this look nicer.</b>

176
00:10:05,382 --> 00:10:07,642
<b>- Don't be so mean to your daughter. - Make it look better.</b>

177
00:10:07,642 --> 00:10:11,012
<b>- I quit. - Don't whine like a kid.</b>

178
00:10:11,012 --> 00:10:13,483
<b>- Let's scrape this off. - Gosh.</b>

179
00:10:13,483 --> 00:10:14,922
<b>- Oh, boy. - Goodness.</b>

180
00:10:14,922 --> 00:10:16,993
<b>- Are you all right? - Gosh.</b>

181
00:10:17,353 --> 00:10:18,662
<b>- Boy, I'm exhausted. - Are you okay?</b>

182
00:10:18,662 --> 00:10:20,662
<b>My, this delicious aroma.</b>

183
00:10:21,262 --> 00:10:23,792
<b>- Gosh, are you all right? - Here you go.</b>

184
00:10:23,892 --> 00:10:25,963
<b>- Oh, I think this is ready. - Yes, take this inside.</b>

185
00:10:25,963 --> 00:10:27,973
<b>- Should I take this inside? - Yes, to the living room.</b>

186
00:10:27,973 --> 00:10:30,573
<b>I'll take this. Hello, hello.</b>

187
00:10:30,573 --> 00:10:31,843
<b>- Hello. - Hi, Jang Woo.</b>

188
00:10:31,843 --> 00:10:33,302
<b>- Hello. - Hurry up.</b>

189
00:10:33,302 --> 00:10:35,613
<b>- Come on. - You didn't get it yet?</b>

190
00:10:35,613 --> 00:10:36,973
<b>- Hurry. - All right.</b>

191
00:10:36,973 --> 00:10:39,243
<b>- Hey, over here! - Okay, I'm coming.</b>

192
00:10:39,243 --> 00:10:42,182
<b>- Hello, hello. - Hi.</b>

193
00:10:42,282 --> 00:10:44,782
<b>Hello, hello. I brought this.</b>

194
00:10:44,782 --> 00:10:46,623
<b>- Hi, Jang Woo! - Hello.</b>

195
00:10:46,623 --> 00:10:48,292
<b>Ladies, say hi. This is Jang Woo.</b>

196
00:10:48,292 --> 00:10:50,292
<b>The one who went on a blind date recently.</b>

197
00:10:50,292 --> 00:10:51,363
<b>A blind date?</b>

198
00:10:51,363 --> 00:10:54,162
<b>- You know Jang Woo. - He's good-looking.</b>

199
00:10:54,162 --> 00:10:56,632
<b>- Seoul National University? - Hello. I'm that guy, Jang Woo.</b>

200
00:10:56,632 --> 00:10:59,233
<b>- Are you looking for something? - No, no.</b>

201
00:10:59,233 --> 00:11:02,172
<b>I'm not. I came inside to drop this off and say hello.</b>

202
00:11:02,172 --> 00:11:04,473
<b>This will be so delicious.</b>

203
00:11:04,743 --> 00:11:06,542
<b>- Thanks for this. - Thank you.</b>

204
00:11:06,542 --> 00:11:08,113
<b>- He's handsome. - He is.</b>

205
00:11:08,973 --> 00:11:11,682
<b>My gosh. Hi, Eun Sil.</b>

206
00:11:11,682 --> 00:11:14,652
<b>- Who are you looking for? - Me? You. I mean, hold on.</b>

207
00:11:14,652 --> 00:11:17,583
<b>I need to use the bathroom so badly. I'll be back.</b>

208
00:11:18,353 --> 00:11:22,453
<b>- He's very handsome. - Right?</b>

209
00:11:22,453 --> 00:11:23,953
<b>Jang Woo went on a blind date?</b>

210
00:11:24,593 --> 00:11:25,593
<b>Over there...</b>

211
00:11:25,593 --> 00:11:28,892
<b>- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.</b>

212
00:11:28,892 --> 00:11:31,093
<b>- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.</b>

213
00:11:31,093 --> 00:11:32,662
<b>1, 2, 3.</b>

214
00:11:36,203 --> 00:11:39,343
<b>So? Is Seung Ho's grandpa all right?</b>

215
00:11:39,603 --> 00:11:41,642
<b>Yes, of course. He's fine.</b>

216
00:11:42,512 --> 00:11:43,743
<b>Thank goodness.</b>

217
00:11:46,782 --> 00:11:49,453
<b>Hey, how did the coffee festival thing go?</b>

218
00:11:49,552 --> 00:11:51,453
<b>It went well, thanks to you.</b>

219
00:11:53,182 --> 00:11:56,522
<b>- Hey, give me that! - Not a chance!</b>

220
00:11:56,522 --> 00:11:58,262
<b>- Hey. - Yes?</b>

221
00:11:59,062 --> 00:12:01,863
<b>I heard you went on a blind date and that you're getting married.</b>

222
00:12:02,792 --> 00:12:04,863
<b>Gosh, what are you talking about?</b>

223
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:08,302
<b>- So it's a groundless rumor? - Of course.</b>

224
00:12:09,473 --> 00:12:11,233
<b>How much of it is not true?</b>

225
00:12:12,873 --> 00:12:15,843
<b>- The "getting married" part. - Then what about the blind date?</b>

226
00:12:16,812 --> 00:12:18,213
<b>I did go on a blind date.</b>

227
00:12:18,213 --> 00:12:20,743
<b>My parents want me to get married soon,</b>

228
00:12:20,743 --> 00:12:22,382
<b>so I went on one, but...</b>

229
00:12:22,382 --> 00:12:23,912
<b>I guess you didn't really like her.</b>

230
00:12:26,453 --> 00:12:27,522
<b>No.</b>

231
00:12:33,323 --> 00:12:36,963
<b>Oh, well. It's not cold at all now, right?</b>

232
00:12:37,233 --> 00:12:39,132
<b>No, it's still very cold.</b>

233
00:12:39,132 --> 00:12:40,503
<b>No, look.</b>

234
00:12:41,603 --> 00:12:43,233
<b>You can only see half of your breath,</b>

235
00:12:43,233 --> 00:12:44,532
<b>compared to the middle of winter.</b>

236
00:12:45,203 --> 00:12:48,113
<b>That might be because of your lung capacity.</b>

237
00:12:48,113 --> 00:12:49,443
<b>- You think so? - Yes.</b>

238
00:12:49,943 --> 00:12:51,412
<b>By the way,</b>

239
00:12:52,012 --> 00:12:55,583
<b>your lips are purple now. It looks so lame.</b>

240
00:12:56,353 --> 00:12:59,552
<b>Jang Woo, you always look lame.</b>

241
00:13:02,353 --> 00:13:03,853
<b>- Really? - Yes.</b>

242
00:13:18,073 --> 00:13:20,902
<b>What are you doing? You need to stay for a few more days.</b>

243
00:13:20,902 --> 00:13:22,412
<b>You still need to get a few tests done.</b>

244
00:13:22,412 --> 00:13:24,073
<b>I'm broke.</b>

245
00:13:25,042 --> 00:13:28,353
<b>They'll move you to a six-person ward when a bed frees up.</b>

246
00:13:31,882 --> 00:13:34,823
<b>- I heard it must've been painful. - Nonsense.</b>

247
00:13:35,823 --> 00:13:37,253
<b>It wasn't so bad.</b>

248
00:13:38,823 --> 00:13:42,132
<b>The doctor said it must've been extremely painful.</b>

249
00:13:42,132 --> 00:13:43,493
<b>It was painful,</b>

250
00:13:44,262 --> 00:13:45,402
<b>but I was too lazy to deal with it.</b>

251
00:13:45,402 --> 00:13:49,103
<b>I heard it must've hurt enough for you to want to see a doctor.</b>

252
00:13:51,503 --> 00:13:55,172
<b>My laziness outdid the pain.</b>

253
00:13:56,772 --> 00:13:57,772
<b>Are we good now?</b>

254
00:13:58,882 --> 00:13:59,983
<b>Auntie.</b>

255
00:14:01,552 --> 00:14:02,912
<b>Auntie!</b>

256
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:06,282
<b>Mok Hae Won, aren't you going back to Seoul?</b>

257
00:14:08,593 --> 00:14:10,493
<b>Those who must leave will leave.</b>

258
00:14:10,993 --> 00:14:13,823
<b>You showing up and bossing me around like this...</b>

259
00:14:14,693 --> 00:14:16,193
<b>exhausts me.</b>

260
00:14:18,162 --> 00:14:19,762
<b>You should go back to Seoul now.</b>

261
00:14:26,802 --> 00:14:29,573
<b>And those who must be left behind will do just that.</b>

262
00:14:31,782 --> 00:14:33,943
<b>That season is coming.</b>

263
00:14:37,382 --> 00:14:40,123
<b>- Hey, this one too. - This too? Okay.</b>

264
00:14:40,123 --> 00:14:42,292
<b>- All good? - Yes, it's great.</b>

265
00:14:42,292 --> 00:14:44,693
<b>- Over here! - She wants more soup.</b>

266
00:14:44,693 --> 00:14:47,292
<b>- My gosh. - There it is.</b>

267
00:14:55,672 --> 00:14:57,573
<b>Oh, okay. No problem.</b>

268
00:14:57,573 --> 00:15:00,042
<b>- Hey! - All right, here it is.</b>

269
00:15:00,272 --> 00:15:01,812
<b>- Try this. - Eat up.</b>

270
00:15:01,812 --> 00:15:05,382
<b>- Can I have more of this? - Thank you.</b>

271
00:15:05,382 --> 00:15:07,682
<b>- Oh, I'll do it. - Okay.</b>

272
00:15:07,682 --> 00:15:10,583
<b>- Thank you! - Look at this.</b>

273
00:15:15,552 --> 00:15:16,823
<b>Hey, go on.</b>

274
00:15:16,823 --> 00:15:18,863
<b>All right. Here you go.</b>

275
00:15:31,542 --> 00:15:34,172
<b>After making rice cakes with rice from last year,</b>

276
00:15:34,172 --> 00:15:37,012
<b>we get ready to plant rice in the field. That's how it goes.</b>

277
00:15:37,613 --> 00:15:39,142
<b>Yes, exactly.</b>

278
00:15:39,743 --> 00:15:41,042
<b>We should...</b>

279
00:15:41,613 --> 00:15:44,483
<b>close down the ice skating rink.</b>

280
00:15:44,713 --> 00:15:46,422
<b>Time flies, doesn't it?</b>

281
00:15:46,422 --> 00:15:48,892
<b>Gosh, you're still young.</b>

282
00:15:50,422 --> 00:15:51,792
<b>- I'll take this. - Okay.</b>

283
00:15:52,623 --> 00:15:56,062
<b>All right, enjoy.</b>

284
00:16:01,463 --> 00:16:04,032
<b>Oh, okay. Sure.</b>

285
00:16:04,032 --> 00:16:06,772
<b>Hello! Yes.</b>

286
00:16:08,103 --> 00:16:11,113
<b>- My gosh! - Come on.</b>

287
00:16:41,003 --> 00:16:43,473
<b>Gosh, you scared me.</b>

288
00:16:43,912 --> 00:16:45,512
<b>Are you coming from the hospital?</b>

289
00:16:47,483 --> 00:16:48,652
<b>What are you doing here?</b>

290
00:16:49,353 --> 00:16:51,282
<b>Did Hae Won call you?</b>

291
00:16:52,453 --> 00:16:53,522
<b>Yes.</b>

292
00:16:55,093 --> 00:16:56,552
<b>I'm okay.</b>

293
00:16:57,792 --> 00:16:59,363
<b>Hae Won overreacted.</b>

294
00:17:02,193 --> 00:17:03,363
<b>Myeong Yeo.</b>

295
00:17:07,762 --> 00:17:09,733
<b>Take off your sunglasses.</b>

296
00:17:42,503 --> 00:17:43,572
<b>No.</b>

297
00:17:47,372 --> 00:17:49,643
<b>This isn't what I...</b>

298
00:17:53,342 --> 00:17:56,082
<b>I sent you here so you could live a full life.</b>

299
00:17:57,512 --> 00:17:59,552
<b>So you could write books, date,</b>

300
00:17:59,753 --> 00:18:01,352
<b>and live your life to the fullest...</b>

301
00:18:01,352 --> 00:18:02,352
<b>How...</b>

302
00:18:06,292 --> 00:18:07,463
<b>But how...</b>

303
00:18:08,933 --> 00:18:10,362
<b>could I do that?</b>

304
00:18:11,633 --> 00:18:12,703
<b>What?</b>

305
00:18:14,332 --> 00:18:15,802
<b>How could I do that?</b>

306
00:18:20,542 --> 00:18:22,143
<b>I killed a person.</b>

307
00:18:30,213 --> 00:18:31,923
<b>Other people...</b>

308
00:18:32,953 --> 00:18:35,122
<b>might have pitied you,</b>

309
00:18:35,993 --> 00:18:37,253
<b>but I didn't.</b>

310
00:18:39,262 --> 00:18:40,862
<b>I pitied myself.</b>

311
00:18:46,032 --> 00:18:47,602
<b>Why would you pity yourself?</b>

312
00:18:49,473 --> 00:18:52,173
<b>I have the right to pay for what I did,</b>

313
00:18:53,842 --> 00:18:56,112

<b>I never thought I would crumble or fall ill...</b>

473
00:30:57,034 --> 00:31:00,645
<b>or grow old and ugly. I have never...</b>

474
00:31:08,014 --> 00:31:10,284
<b>thought of that in my entire life.</b>

475
00:31:18,194 --> 00:31:21,365
<b>I never imagined spending the rest of my life...</b>

476
00:31:23,994 --> 00:31:26,534
<b>alone in this empty place...</b>

477
00:31:31,204 --> 00:31:35,204
<b>like someone waiting to die.</b>

478
00:31:37,615 --> 00:31:38,815
<b>Have a good life.</b>

479
00:31:42,484 --> 00:31:44,085
<b>Have a good life.</b>

480
00:31:44,954 --> 00:31:47,054
<b>Get married like you've always wanted,</b>

481
00:31:47,954 --> 00:31:50,724
<b>have kids like you've always dreamed of,</b>

482
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:52,524
<b>and live happily ever after.</b>

483
00:31:52,524 --> 00:31:54,494
<b>And the truth is,</b>

484
00:31:54,494 --> 00:31:56,895
<b>Myeong Yeo.</b>

485
00:31:57,365 --> 00:32:01,034
<b>Please be happy. Forget an idiot like me, okay?</b>

486
00:32:02,034 --> 00:32:03,534
<b>I have never...</b>

487
00:32:05,335 --> 00:32:07,875
<b>wanted to break up with you for a single moment.</b>

488
00:32:10,575 --> 00:32:13,784
<b>Sir, can you turn the car around?</b>

489
00:32:20,085 --> 00:32:21,585
<b>That's the truth,</b>

490
00:32:22,524 --> 00:32:23,724
<b>Cha Yun Taek.</b>

491
00:32:51,254 --> 00:32:52,984
<b>This way.</b>

492
00:32:57,454 --> 00:33:01,065
<b>Why do you keep coming back to this town?</b>

493
00:33:01,065 --> 00:33:03,365
<b>You told me about the train schedule.</b>

494
00:33:09,364 --> 00:33:10,735
<b>Hey, Shim Myeong Yeo.</b>

495
00:33:11,804 --> 00:33:13,304
<b>Let me hug you just once.</b>

496
00:33:14,244 --> 00:33:15,244
<b>What?</b>

497
00:33:28,525 --> 00:33:29,525
<b>No.</b>

498
00:33:40,965 --> 00:33:42,364
<b>To be honest,</b>

499
00:33:43,775 --> 00:33:46,005
<b>I never wanted to break up with you either...</b>

500
00:33:47,204 --> 00:33:48,674
<b>for a single moment.</b>

501
00:33:50,974 --> 00:33:53,744
<b>Are you sure you read what I did...</b>

502
00:33:55,744 --> 00:33:57,355
<b>in the manuscript I sent you?</b>

503

506

<b>what is the truth and what is a lie.</b>

507
00:34:15,864 --> 00:34:17,935
<b>Look at yourself right now.</b>

508
00:34:18,935 --> 00:34:20,404
<b>Is that wrong?</b>

509
00:34:22,145 --> 00:34:23,474
<b>You are...</b>

510
00:34:25,045 --> 00:34:28,085
<b>more tolerant than I thought, Cha Yun Taek.</b>

511
00:34:28,384 --> 00:34:29,415
<b>Of course, I am.</b>

512
00:34:31,014 --> 00:34:33,054
<b>That's why I loved you.</b>

513
00:35:04,085 --> 00:35:05,355
<b>Hello.</b>

514
00:35:05,954 --> 00:35:07,424
<b>- Hey. - You're all here.</b>

515
00:35:07,424 --> 00:35:09,454
<b>- Hello. - Hyun Ji, don't carry that around.</b>

516
00:35:09,454 --> 00:35:11,195
<b>Did someone smack you in the head with it?</b>

517
00:35:11,855 --> 00:35:13,364
<b>- Hello. - Welcome.</b>

518
00:35:13,364 --> 00:35:15,494
<b>- Jang Woo, you're here. - Hello, sir.</b>

519
00:35:15,795 --> 00:35:16,835
<b>What's up?</b>

520
00:35:17,364 --> 00:35:19,904
<b>- Hi, Eun Sil. - I'm glad you're here. Come inside.</b>

521
00:35:19,904 --> 00:35:22,105
<b>Inside? Just the two of us in that small room?</b>

522
00:35:22,105 --> 00:35:24,304
<b>Wait, let me put this down. Hang on.</b>

523
00:35:25,275 --> 00:35:28,145
<b>- Why are you so late? - I dropped by my place.</b>

524
00:35:34,915 --> 00:35:37,085
<b>- Eun Sil, what is it? - I'm glad you're here.</b>

525
00:35:37,085 --> 00:35:38,415
<b>Taste this.</b>

526
00:35:41,585 --> 00:35:42,654
<b>What do you think?</b>

527
00:35:43,795 --> 00:35:46,025
<b>- What? - How does it taste?</b>

528
00:35:47,724 --> 00:35:48,795
<b>I don't know.</b>

529
00:35:49,525 --> 00:35:51,594
<b>Oh, no. What do I do?</b>

530
00:35:51,835 --> 00:35:52,895
<b>Then...</b>

531
00:35:54,935 --> 00:35:56,005
<b>What about this?</b>

532
00:35:59,404 --> 00:36:01,174
<b>Oh, it tastes good.</b>

533
00:36:01,174 --> 00:36:03,014
<b>- What? - What?</b>

534
00:36:04,715 --> 00:36:05,844
<b>I bought this.</b>

535
00:36:06,815 --> 00:36:09,014
<b>I bought this one from my mom's shop.</b>

536
00:36:09,915 --> 00:36:13,185
<b>So are you saying this is the only thing that tastes good?</b>

537
00:36:14,355 --> 00:36:15,784
<b>No, I didn't mean that.</b>

538
00:36:15,884 --> 00:36:18,855
<b>Then... what about this?</b>

539
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:23,695
<b>What do you think? Is it too salty? Sweet?</b>

540
00:36:24,594 --> 00:36:26,465
<b>- I really don't know. - Seriously!</b>

541
00:36:26,465 --> 00:36:29,335
<b>Do you only lose your sense of taste for my food? Are you kidding me?</b>

542
00:36:29,335 --> 00:36:31,404
<b>You little... Oh, gosh!</b>

543
00:36:38,645 --> 00:36:42,014
<b>My gosh, your arm... Your arm is very strong.</b>

544
00:36:42,014 --> 00:36:44,554
<b>Oh, I have strong legs too.</b>

545
00:36:44,554 --> 00:36:48,025
<b>My gosh, it's so nice. I mean, good for you.</b>

546
00:36:50,154 --> 00:36:52,724
<b>Hey, you two. What are you guys doing?</b>

547
00:36:52,724 --> 00:36:54,395
<b>Oh. What?</b>

548
00:36:54,665 --> 00:36:56,395
<b>- What do you mean? - Gosh.</b>

549
00:36:56,395 --> 00:36:58,494
<b>- What's with that smirk? - Well, we were just...</b>

550
00:36:59,904 --> 00:37:02,134
<b>- What's going on? - Nothing.</b>

551
00:37:02,134 --> 00:37:03,134
<b>What?</b>

552
00:37:03,534 --> 00:37:04,804
<b>All right, let's see.</b>

553
00:37:05,134 --> 00:37:07,744
<b>My, what a nice blanket.</b>

554
00:37:07,744 --> 00:37:10,315
<b>Right? It took me so long to make this.</b>

555
00:37:10,315 --> 00:37:12,174
<b>- Isn't it so nice? - Yes, it is.</b>

556
00:37:18,185 --> 00:37:19,985
<b>- Geun Sang. - Yes?</b>

557
00:37:20,454 --> 00:37:21,685
<b>When you're done with that,</b>

558
00:37:21,685 --> 00:37:24,424
<b>can you clean the mold too?</b>

559
00:37:24,424 --> 00:37:26,295
<b>Sure, I was going to do that anyway.</b>

560
00:37:36,534 --> 00:37:37,534
<b>Hey, here you go.</b>

561
00:37:40,275 --> 00:37:43,715
<b>My gosh, Hyun Ji. How come you're so good at this?</b>

562
00:37:43,715 --> 00:37:44,875
<b>Did you take classes or something?</b>

563
00:37:44,875 --> 00:37:47,145
<b>I thought it'd be cool to include it in my hip-hop performance,</b>

564
00:37:47,145 --> 00:37:48,485
<b>so I practiced it.</b>

565
00:37:49,514 --> 00:37:52,255
<b>Goodness. And people call me a lunatic?</b>

566
00:37:52,685 --> 00:37:54,185
<b>Gosh, unreal.</b>

567
00:38:02,324 --> 00:38:06,565
<b>Young Soo. The more I think about it, the angrier I get.</b>

568
00:38:06,565 --> 00:38:08,364
<b>I'm talking about Song Jae In.</b>

569
00:38:08,364 --> 00:38:11,804
<b>The girl who's been telling everyone that she's your girlfriend.</b>

570
00:38:11,804 --> 00:38:15,244
<b>What on earth did you say to her? She totally beat me up.</b>

571
00:38:15,244 --> 00:38:17,514
<b>Hey, I've never been slapped in the face before.</b>

572
00:38:17,514 --> 00:38:18,875
<b>I've been a total outcast for two years,</b>

573
00:38:18,875 --> 00:38:21,685
<b>but no one ever slapped me in the face.</b>

574
00:38:21,685 --> 00:38:24,255
<b>I heard you pulled her hair out too.</b>

575
00:38:26,085 --> 00:38:28,954
<b>Well... She started it though.</b>

576
00:38:30,094 --> 00:38:34,465
<b>Did you just scoff? Do you want to get involved in the fight?</b>

577
00:38:36,395 --> 00:38:37,735
<b>- Hey. - What?</b>

578
00:38:39,494 --> 00:38:41,804
<b>Song Jae In wants to go to school with us every morning.</b>

579
00:38:41,804 --> 00:38:43,835
<b>What? Why?</b>

580
00:38:43,835 --> 00:38:46,134
<b>No! I hate it!</b>

581
00:38:46,134 --> 00:38:48,545
<b>Gosh, I really don't want to do that.</b>

582
00:39:07,395 --> 00:39:09,224
<b>We're here. Let's go inside.</b>

583
00:39:12,735 --> 00:39:13,804
<b>Let's go.</b>

584
00:39:14,465 --> 00:39:16,235
<b>1, 2, 3.</b>

585
00:39:16,235 --> 00:39:19,505
<b>- Welcome home! - Welcome home!</b>

586
00:39:35,585 --> 00:39:38,255
<b>- How are you feeling? - I'm great.</b>

587
00:39:38,255 --> 00:39:39,724
<b>Did you have dinner?</b>

588
00:39:39,724 --> 00:39:41,424
<b>- No, he hasn't eaten yet. - My gosh.</b>

589
00:39:41,424 --> 00:39:42,994
<b>- Oh, right. - Let's go in, Seung Ho.</b>

590
00:39:42,994 --> 00:39:44,465
<b>The ones you made are no good.</b>

591
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:46,295
<b>- Why? - Gosh, go on in.</b>

592
00:39:46,295 --> 00:39:48,335
<b>- Come on. - What?</b>

593
00:39:57,945 --> 00:39:59,344
<b>You must be exhausted.</b>

594
00:39:59,344 --> 00:40:00,344
<b>No, I'm good.</b>

595
00:40:00,545 --> 00:40:02,145
<b>Go in and get some rest.</b>

596
00:40:02,145 --> 00:40:03,145
<b>Okay.</b>

597
00:40:04,614 --> 00:40:05,855
<b>Oh, right.</b>

598
00:40:07,585 --> 00:40:10,755
<b>Bo Yeong said sorry.</b>

599
00:40:11,395 --> 00:40:13,494
<b>She sincerely apologized to me.</b>

600
00:40:14,764 --> 00:40:16,594
<b>But she also said that she hates me.</b>

601
00:40:18,165 --> 00:40:20,565
<b>She hates me because she liked me.</b>

602
00:40:20,565 --> 00:40:23,335
<b>And she said I probably disliked her.</b>

603
00:40:24,574 --> 00:40:25,735
<b>Did you?</b>

604
00:40:26,704 --> 00:40:28,005
<b>I'm not sure.</b>

605
00:40:29,445 --> 00:40:32,215
<b>Did I never like her to begin with?</b>

606
00:40:34,315 --> 00:40:36,715
<b>All I can think about is the way I feel about her now,</b>

607
00:40:37,185 --> 00:40:40,454
<b>so I can't even recall how I used to feel about her when we were close.</b>

608
00:40:43,554 --> 00:40:46,494
<b>But things can't go back to the way they used to be...</b>

609
00:40:46,494 --> 00:40:48,264
<b>even if I remember how I used to feel about her.</b>

610
00:40:50,134 --> 00:40:52,735
<b>Trust is like glass.</b>

611
00:40:53,435 --> 00:40:56,165
<b>Once broken, the cracks will always be visible...</b>

612
00:40:56,165 --> 00:40:58,204
<b>even if you glue the broken pieces back together.</b>

613
00:40:59,304 --> 00:41:00,344
<b>That's true.</b>

614
00:41:08,415 --> 00:41:10,255
<b>Don't think too much though.</b>

615
00:41:15,824 --> 00:41:16,824
<b>Go on in.</b>

616
00:41:18,154 --> 00:41:19,224
<b>Bye.</b>

617
00:41:23,195 --> 00:41:24,565
<b>Drive safely.</b>

618
00:41:43,315 --> 00:41:45,915
<b>Eun Seop, I sent you an e-mail.</b>

619
00:41:46,255 --> 00:41:47,554

00:43:25,415 --> 00:43:27,884
<b>I read your e-mail.</b>

00:43:31,424 --> 00:43:33,295
<b>You wrote that it's up to me to decide...</b>

<b>whether or not I want to share what I read with Hae Won.</b>
