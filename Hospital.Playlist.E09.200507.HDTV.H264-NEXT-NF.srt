HOSPITAL PLAYLIST

2
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:28,520
Why won't you do the surgery?

3
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:30,480
Please get her the surgery now!

4
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:32,860
Let's give it more time, sir.

5
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:36,530
And you can't undergo surgery yourself
in that condition, sir.

6
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:39,950
I'm her father,
and I said I want to donate my liver.

7
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:41,830
Who are you to stop me?

8
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:44,290
It's my decision and I want to save her
with my liver!

9
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:47,250
We have the same blood types.

10
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:49,460
And she's my daughter. What's the problem?

11
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:51,170
Get her the surgery now.

12
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:53,170
I want the surgery right now!

13
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,470
Listen. If my daughter dies
because we wasted our time,

14
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,430
will you take responsibility for it?

15
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:00,140
Will you?

16
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:02,430
Sir, I've explained it to you before.

17
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,600
Even if you're her family,

18
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,810
it's not that easy to proceed
with transplant surgery.

19
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:09,190
And you're not at a young age.

20
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:12,230
On top of that,
you're not that healthy, either.

21
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,240
Sir, would you like to have
some coffee with me?

22
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:18,360
-Okay.
-Calm down. This way.

23
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:25,540
Sir, I'll be honest.

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,080
You're quite old,

25
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:33,170
so if I were to follow the rules,
you don't qualify to get a surgery.

26
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:36,220
But we ran the tests
for the worst-case scenario.

27
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:38,970
Luckily, everything seemed to be fine
except for one area.

28
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:41,050
You have a fatty liver.

29
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:44,350
Usually, in these cases,
the donor must lose weight

30
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:46,100
to get rid of fat in the liver.

31
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:49,730
But given your age, this won't be easy.

32
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:54,070
Sir, why don't we wait
for a brain-dead patient a bit longer?

33
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,820
There's something called a MELD score.

34
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,870
This number determines
who gets the liver first.

35
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:03,080
And her number is considered pretty high.

36
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,790
Given her score now,

37
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:07,620
I think we can afford to wait a few more
days to make our decision.

38
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:12,090
Does my daughter have a high score?

39
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:14,710
Yes.

40
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:17,920
It's at 36. It's pretty high.

41
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:22,140
But to be honest,
her score has to be 39 or 40

42
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:24,470
to receive a liver
from a brain-dead patient,

43
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,180
so it won't guarantee her a liver.

44
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:33,060
Let's wait a few more days.

45
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:35,820
If your daughter's condition
becomes critical,

46
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:38,860
I'll make a decision, then.
So let's be a bit more patient, sir.

47
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,700
Yes, please.

48
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,660
It's time for her meal now.

49
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:49,410
She must be waiting for you.
Please go and enjoy lunch with her.

50
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:53,790
Okay. Thank you.

51
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,020
Hey. She's wearing hair rollers.

52
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,690
That's nothing new.

53
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,400
Do you see the freckles there?

54
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:21,950
I didn't know
So-mi had that many freckles.

55
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:24,030
Bring her here.
A laser treatment will remove them.

56
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,200
She's wearing makeup. The freckle makeup.

57
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,000
-Why?
-I don't know.

58
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:30,870
Why not? She's your daughter.

59
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,960
-Do you always understand U-ju?
-Right. No.

60
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:40,340
I think U-ju is going
through the sock phase these days.

61
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,880
It takes him about 30 minutes
to pick a pair of socks.

62
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,220
Right. I subscribed to So-mi's channel.

63
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:49,060
She's the number one teenage YouTuber
when it comes to cosmetic videos.

64
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:51,980
Seriously. Even I wanted
to try a few of her videos.

65
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,980
Forty, okay?

66
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,650
What? What's wrong with my age?
Men still want to doll up at 40.

67
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:00,530
I mean, my daughter weighs 40kg.

68
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:01,530
I see.

69
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:03,650
I think she weighs less than that.

70
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:06,280
My gosh.
She still hasn't had her first period.

71
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:08,830
She still hasn't?
But she's in eighth grade.

72
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:10,080
That is a bit late.

73
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:12,790
I wanted to take her to a clinic,
but she won't listen.

74
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:17,000
What about your lunch?
You're not going to have lunch?

75
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:20,380
I'm meeting up with the others
in the cafeteria. Join us.

76
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:23,130
I have somewhere to be.

77
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:25,050
I have a shift from 12 p.m. to 2 p.m.

78
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:26,930
What shift?

79
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:29,560
Well...

80
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,810
You have outpatients now, right?

81
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:37,770
If I stayed ten minutes longer,
I probably had to marry Seok-hyeong.

82
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,440
-Bye.
-Bye.

83
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:42,780
Ma'am!

84
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:46,910
Did you hear
that Seok-hyeong is going to adopt me?

85
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:50,830
Seok-hyeong promised to give me his house,
TV, and the recliner chair.

86
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:01,500
HOSPITAL PLAYLIST

87
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:04,510
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

88
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,430
It's 100 over 70.

89
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:12,140
It's good.

90
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,930
Really? Thank you.

91
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:15,350
Did you have dinner?

92
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:17,810
-I'll need to go home after my shift.
-I see.

93
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,190
What about you?

94
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:21,150
Later, I'm going to have...

95
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:23,150
Mom, I'm back!

96
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:24,650
You're back.

97
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,370
Hello.

98
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:31,410
Hello.

99
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,080
Did you bring the humidifier?

100
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:40,040
Jun-wan brought it this morning.

101
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:42,300
And he stopped by to fill it up
this afternoon, too.

102
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,800
He didn't look like the considerate type,
but he is.

103
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,220
You can tell he's considerate
just by his looks.

104
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,050
Mom, he's a bit perverted like Jeong-won.

105
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:56,430
Ma'am, aren't you sick
of eating hospital food?

106
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,560
How about beef bone soup?
I'll sneak it in here from the cafeteria.

107
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,730
I'm all right.

108
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:03,440
You guys should go out and have some food.

109
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,070
Call the others, too.

110
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:06,940
I'm not leaving.

111
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,820
I'm going to stay next to you
for 24 hours starting today.

112
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:11,530
Don't you need to work?

113
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,990
I'm fine now.

114
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,950
But what caused arrhythmia
all of a sudden?

115
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:20,710
We couldn't even find out what caused it
from the electrophysiology study.

116
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,840
This is making me really anxious.

117
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,760
It's because I'm old.

118
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:28,380
When you get old,
your body starts failing one at a time.

119
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,260
Go out and get some food now.

120
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,300
Ma'am, I'll get you beef bone soup.

121
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:35,390
I think a warm bowl of soup
will help you recover.

122
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,660
Ma'am, I'll get you beef bone soup.

123
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,660
I think a warm bowl of soup
will help you recover.

124
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:44,300
I'll stay with her now.

125
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:46,010
I bet you stayed at the hospital all day.

126
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:48,260
Go outside and get some air.

127
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,180
You must've been startled, Seok-hyeong.

128
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:55,140
Yes. Are you coming from Yangpyeong?

129
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:57,310
Yes. I made Jong-su drive.

130
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,230
I made your mom's favorite,
pumpkin porridge and beef bone soup.

131
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:02,730
I didn't make a lot, so you should
get some food outside. Go.

132
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:04,270
Yes, Seok-hyeong.

133
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,740
Treat your friends to some meat.

134
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:08,530
That will help me feel better.

135
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:11,070
Jeong-won, leave with Seok-hyeong.

136
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:14,330
He's been staying inside the hospital
for three straight days.

137
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:18,160
But are they available?

138
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:19,500
Yes.

139
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:22,460
I just typed in "meat",
and they are all coming.

140
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:36,560
Would you like to order?

141
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,680
Who's buying today?

142
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:39,180
-Your dad.
-Nice.

143
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:40,520
Two of the most expensive sets.

144
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,020
Give us two special sets, please.

145
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,310
-Mushroom set, too.
-Okay.

146
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,110
And a set of homemade sausages, too.

147
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:48,360
That's too much.
One half dried pollack <i>naengmyeon</i>.

148
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,700
Hey, order noodles after eating the meat.

149
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:51,700
It's my preference.

150
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:55,160
My goodness. You guys would
never turn down a free meal.

151
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,040
Two of pork kimchi stew, please.

152
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:58,790
One for each table. Thank you.

153
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:00,040
-Okay.
-Right.

154
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,080
It's spicy,
so give us two pots of steamed eggs.

155
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:23,650
You guys can talk.

156
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:26,900
Can I eat this now?

157
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:28,530
-What?
-Song-hwa, that's beef!

158
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:29,820
-You can't.
-Is that tuna?

159
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,820
-That's pork.
-Why don't you eat it raw?

160
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,150
Is that pork tartare?

161
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:54,010
No one is going to steal your food.
That's all yours.

162
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:56,180
You'll eat all of them, so slow down.

163
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:58,140
I have three older brothers.

164
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:00,010
Yes, your brothers are all bony.

165
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:04,230
Seok-hyeong, I heard
your mother decided to divorce him.

166
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:06,440
-Yes.
-Really? That's great news.

167
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,820
She'll finally be able to live her life.

168
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,650
She decided to divorce him.

169
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:13,820
I cried and begged her on my knees
to divorce him.

170
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:16,660
I said we should be happy
even if we just had one day left to live.

171
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,660
-Good job.
-That must've been hard.

172
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:20,450
My goodness, well done.

173
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:22,910
She might say that now.

174
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,830
But what if she gets angry one day
and says she won't divorce him?

175
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,460
We already filed the divorce papers
through her lawyer yesterday.

176
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:31,840
Chairman Yang was probably
surprised and happy to see it,

177
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,210
so he filed the paperwork today.

178
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:36,720
The mandatory waiting period
is four weeks, so just one more month.

179
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:40,010
In one month, this will all be over.

180
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:44,680
But when my mom told me
that she would divorce him...

181
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:47,730
Now that she's finally divorcing him,

182
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:50,400
it felt so freaking nice.

183
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:54,570
It's different from when you got yours,
right?

184
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:57,280
Of course. When I got divorced,
I was really heartbroken.

185
00:09:58,070 --> 00:09:59,990
-You weren't?
-I wasn't.

186
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:01,280
Not even in the slightest.

187
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:05,410
I only thought about
how I could have a happy life with U-ju.

188
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,710
Don't tell me
you're still not over Sin-ae.

189
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:10,670
Come on. Do you think I'm mad?
No, that's not it.

190
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:13,590
I'm over her. I got over her,

191
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:19,510
but deep down, a part of me
always feels sorry to her.

192
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:21,890
-You're not over her.
-No, I'm already over her.

193
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:23,770
And it's more like a connection, not love.

194
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:26,940
I feel sorry and heartbroken.
It's something like that.

195
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:28,520
-What is that?
-I don't know.

196
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,770
Goodness, you know nothing about love.

197
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:34,440
Just eat up, you kids.

198
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:37,700
It's a shame you won't get the company.
When your father passes away,

199
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:40,910
all of his assets will go
to that woman and her child.

200
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:42,780
Taegeon Apparel isn't a listed company.

201
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:44,790
And his father owns
most of the shares, right?

202
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:47,040
But I think he can claim
a part of his assets legally.

203
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,460
I don't need his money.
I won't accept it even if he offers.

204
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:51,630
Exactly. Money isn't the problem now.

205
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:53,420
-No way.
-No way.

206
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:55,590
You're so annoying.

207
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:59,550
Seok-hyeong, listen to me carefully. Okay?

208
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:03,140
Don't talk such nonsense like
you won't accept the money or whatnot.

209
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:05,640
Just take it no matter what.

210
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,060
Take it and give it to us.

211
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,770
Okay.

212
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:11,690
I'll get the money
and give it to you guys.

213
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:16,610
By the way, did you hear
about the chairman?

214
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:19,110
Yes, I heard from my mom.

215
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,660
What about him?

216
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:24,080
Mr. Ju has been experiencing
early symptoms of depression.

217
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,160
What?

218
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:27,370
Oh, no.

219
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:30,790
I can completely relate to him, Rosa.

220
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:33,250
I also wrote my will once.

221
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:35,960
What did you write on it?

222
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:40,380
Did you write, "I want you to die,
you bastard, Yang Tae-yang."

223
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,930
I ought to tell them to his face.

224
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:45,470
Why would I waste papers on that?

225
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:48,640
Is that why you splashed
a bucket of dirty water on them?

226
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:49,930
Yes.

227
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:52,230
It was embarrassing to face my son,

228
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,650
but it felt nice.

229
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:55,940
That was great.
You must blow off the steam.

230
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:59,190
Do whatever you want to do and
say whatever you want to say. Good job.

231
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:02,660
So what is the chairman going to do?

232
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:04,120
Will he go to therapy?

233
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,740
He doesn't want therapy.
He said he's fine.

234
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:09,410
He said it's the autumn blues.

235
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:10,660
He's so pig-headed.

236
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:13,540
You should stay with him
and take care of him.

237
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:16,290
He seemed to have the best time with you.

238
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,170
I told him to come upstairs now.

239
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:20,630
He said he'll come up after a phone call.

240
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,920
But he won't get that call.

241
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:23,380
What phone call?

242
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:26,930
He was going to have dinner with his
second son's family. It's been a while.

243
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:29,140
But all of a sudden,
his grandson got an upset stomach,

244
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,770
so it was canceled.

245
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:32,810
They were going to give him a call,

246
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:35,650
but they probably forgot to call
because things are hectic.

247
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:37,570
He can call first.

248
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:38,610
Right.

249
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,940
He could just call them first,

250
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:45,030
but I think he feels bad
that by calling them,

251
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:47,870
he might be bothering them
when they are already busy.

252
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:51,370
When you're old,
all sorts of thoughts cross your mind.

253
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:12,430
<i>Yes, Dad.</i>

254
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:14,310
Hey.

255
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:17,440
How's Yun-min? What happened?

256
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:20,020
<i>When we got to the hospital,
he was completely fine, you know.</i>

257
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:22,690
<i>-Goodness. Can you stop moving?</i>
-Gosh, what a relief.

258
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:25,150
<i>Yun-hyeon. Yun-min. My goodness.</i>

259
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,360
And he's okay now?

260
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:28,450
<i>Yes, he's okay now.</i>

261
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:31,200
<i>-He's having fun playing with his brother.
-Guys, stop that.</i>

262
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:33,160
<i>We got him his favorite pizza and Coke.</i>

263
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:35,120
<i>So he's singing and is in a good mood.</i>

264
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:37,580
But still, don't feed him a lot of food.

265
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:39,380
He should be careful today.

266
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:40,460
<i>Okay.</i>

267
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,300
<i>Oh, Dad.</i>

268
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:45,380
Yes. What is it?

269
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:49,930
<i>Yun-hyeon and Yun-min took a photo
in their taekwondo suits this afternoon.</i>

270
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:51,220
<i>They looked so cute.</i>

271
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:52,930
<i>I'll send it to you now.</i>

272
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,350
Okay. Thank you.

273
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:56,230
Enjoy your dinner.

274
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,650
<i>Okay. Have a goodnight, Dad.</i>

275
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:20,790
Hey, Rosa.

276
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,250
<i>What's taking you so long?</i>

277
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:23,710
<i>Did Tae-ung call?</i>

278
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,670
Yes, he called just now.

279
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,300
Yun-min is fine.

280
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:30,680
<i>That's good to hear.
You need to eat your dinner.</i>

281
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,140
<i>Come up now. You must be hungry.</i>

282
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:33,850
It's okay. I'm not hungry.

283
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:35,730
<i>You'll skip dinner?</i>

284
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:36,980
<i>No, come upstairs now.</i>

285
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:40,020
Hey, skipping a meal won't kill me.

286
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:40,940
I'll be fine.

287
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:44,070
Aren't you going home soon?
Come down. I'll drive you home.

288
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:46,360
<i>If we start skipping meals at our age,
we'll never eat.</i>

289
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,280
<i>It'll be awful.</i>

290
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:51,530
<i>I won't nag you. Come upstairs now. Okay?</i>

291
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,870
My goodness, you win.

292
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:00,790
The liver transplantation from a living
donor usually starts early in the morning.

293
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:03,960
As both surgeries must be
performed at the same time,

294
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:06,960
it takes long
and requires a lot of people.

295
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:09,510
Professors usually come
around eight in the morning.

296
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:11,640
They come down
when the anesthesiologist is ready.

297
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:15,010
And before the surgery, the scrub nurses
set up the operating room.

298
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:20,900
Today, we'll do
a living donor liver transplant.

299
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,310
The donor is a man in his 50s,

300
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,020
is the patient's younger brother.

301
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:27,530
The anatomy type of the donor's biliary
tract is C, so it'll be a difficult case.

302
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:30,820
But Professor Lee will be careful,
so there won't be a problem.

303
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:34,780
Professor Lee might seem
distracted and all over the place,

304
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:36,660
but he's a really good surgeon.

305
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:37,830
What did you say?

306
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,710
Was that criticism or a compliment?

307
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:43,330
What are you doing here?

308
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:44,500
I'm studying.

309
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,210
-Are you assisting me today?
-No.

310
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:49,720
Dr. Jong Se-hyeok will assist you today.

311
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,560
Here's the liver specimen
for frozen biopsy.

312
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,320
KIM CHANG-HWAN

313
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:28,840
It's taking a bit too long today.

314
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:35,140
<i>This is Kim Mi-ae from Pathology.</i>

315
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:38,680
<i>Here's the result of the frozen biopsy
of the patient, Kim Chang-hwan.</i>

316
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:41,140
<i>The macrovesicular fatty change
is six percent.</i>

317
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:44,190
<i>And there's no inflammation
around the hepatic portal vein.</i>

318
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:45,690
Okay. Thank you!

319
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:47,110
Let's start right away.

320
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:53,860
Please put on some music.

321
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:12,470
Neurosurgeons don't usually say

322
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:14,300
that everything will be okay

323
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:16,720
and that the patient
will definitely recover.

324
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:20,220
Since we deal with brains,

325
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:23,350
there's a less chance
of seeing a dramatic improvement

326
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:25,390
after the surgery
compared to other departments.

327
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:26,690
I see.

328
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:29,110
I'm taking out the tumor now.

329
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:40,490
-Are you cold?
-No, I'm fine.

330
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:43,330
I easily get cold.

331
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:46,540
You can't survive in CS, then.

332
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:50,710
<i>Are you okay, Yun-bok?</i>

333
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:53,420
<i>Aren't you cold? Hold on.</i>

334
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:56,840
I can't see it. Pull it to my side.

335
00:17:56,930 --> 00:17:58,140
Yes, sir.

336
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:02,430
CURRENT TEMPERATURE: 18

337
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:07,810
-Aren't you cold?
-I'm okay.

338
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:14,320
Thank you.

339
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:18,570
When we stop the heart and use
a heart-lung machine during surgery,

340
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:21,870
the patient won't get much blood flow
as the heart is stopped.

341
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:23,950
So we must slow down
the patient's metabolic rate.

342
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:25,910
We lower the temperature

343
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,540
to help the organs' metabolic rates
go down, so the patient uses less energy.

344
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:33,340
That way, when the heart beats again,
the patient can make a good recovery.

345
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:35,050
Where is Hong-do?

346
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:36,760
He's attending a pediatrics surgery.

347
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,680
I see. Does he easily get hot?

348
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:41,140
Yes. Very easily.

349
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:42,810
My goodness.

350
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:43,890
Oh, no.

351
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:06,290
Gauze, please.

352
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:10,330
CURRENT TEMPERATURE: 30.3

353
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:20,590
Hey, are you all right?

354
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:21,970
-Are you okay?
-Doctor.

355
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:23,220
Are you okay?

356
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:25,060
The student collapsed, right?

357
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:29,020
-Yes.
-Is he okay?

358
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,770
Yes. It took a while this year.

359
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:33,940
Last year, a student fainted around June.

360
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,910
Hello, my baby.

361
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:47,330
It's Mommy.

362
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,420
Okay.

363
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:54,210
-I don't have a clear view.
-Okay.

364
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:59,130
When you're suturing the uterus,
make sure to keep it tight.

365
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,220
But you can't pull too hard.

366
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,680
Okay.

367
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:10,730
Professor Yang, the students
from the nursing school are here.

368
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,310
Ma'am, congratulations.

369
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,900
Thank you.

370
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:17,110
I already informed the mother.

371
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:19,820
If you came a bit early,
you could have seen the baby coming out.

372
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:22,910
You have another surgery this afternoon.
Hopefully, we can see it then.

373
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:24,320
You may approach closer.

374
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:27,160
Make sure not to contaminate
the operating table.

375
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:34,210
NURSING STUDENT, KIM YEONG-JU

376
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:36,840
Hello.

377
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:45,390
My gosh. Did your surgery just finish?

378
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:48,310
-That was a long one.
-Controlling the bleeding took some time.

379
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:49,310
But it went well.

380
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:51,430
-You're getting off work late.
-Yes.

381
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,770
Right. It's about the patient, Oh Yu-min.
The patient in Room 6011.

382
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:57,270
She's waiting for a donor
due to liver cirrhosis.

383
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,980
-Yes.
-Can you call her father?

384
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:02,360
We must let him know that
the patient is getting worse now.

385
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:06,370
It's been a while
since he stopped coming to the hospital.

386
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:08,700
He stopped coming after last week.

387
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,450
That's right.
I haven't seen him around lately.

388
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:15,040
Does she have other family members?

389
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,420
No. She doesn't have any family.

390
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:20,920
I heard she hadn't seen her father
for a while before her condition, either.

391
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:23,090
My gosh, what should we do?

392
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:26,840
He might have gone somewhere, you know.

393
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:29,310
-He'll be back.
-I doubt it.

394
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:31,680
Okay.

395
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:34,890
I've been doing this over a decade now,

396
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:36,810
so I can tell just by their eyes.

397
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,900
I can tell if they will go through with it

398
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:41,110
or if getting the donation
will be difficult.

399
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:44,280
And her father is the latter case.

400
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,700
I can tell you
that he will never come back.

401
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:50,240
The decision is his,

402
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:52,410
so I can't criticize him for it.

403
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,330
Besides, getting a piece of his liver

404
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,120
seemed challenging from the get-go.

405
00:21:57,210 --> 00:21:58,420
Anyway, I got it.

406
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,250
Professor Lee.

407
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:03,590
It's raining outside.

408
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,050
It's been raining since the morning.
You didn't know, right?

409
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:09,430
Have a goodnight.

410
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,100
Bye.

411
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,320
It's raining. Let's eat.

412
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:27,360
-Are you done with the surgery?
-That's why I'm here.

413
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:28,610
What should we get?

414
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:31,120
How about <i>jeon</i>? Or <i>sujebi</i>?

415
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,910
Of course, it's got to be <i>sujebi</i>.
See you in the lobby.

416
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:35,750
I didn't drive today. Let's take your car.

417
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:37,290
Sure.

418
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,760
WET FIELD SUJEBI

419
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:52,140
It's raining. Shall we go for a drive?

420
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:54,010
Sounds great.

421
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:56,060
What about U-ju?

422
00:22:56,890 --> 00:22:59,850
He's in Changwon.
He's hooked on pork rice soup these days.

423
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:02,230
What about your dad's hearing aid?
Did you really refund it?

424
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:04,110
No way. You think I'm nuts?

425
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:07,280
I talked to Professor Song
to get the best one for my dad.

426
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,990
Why did you tell him how much it cost?

427
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:10,280
I didn't tell him.

428
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:12,320
My dad somehow found out.

429
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:16,040
My gosh. Anyway, I told him
that I got the employee discount,

430
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,620
used a coupon, and a credit card discount.

431
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:20,290
I came up with all sorts of white lies.

432
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:22,710
I had to tell about millions of lies

433
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:24,500
and said I paid less than one million won.

434
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:27,630
I barely managed to persuade him
to wear it.

435
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,090
Gosh, don't get so mad about it.

436
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:31,760
He doesn't want you to spend money.

437
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,600
Ma'am, more kimchi, please.

438
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,890
Yes, what is it?

439
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:38,810
<i>The patient has a cerebellar hemorrhage</i>

440
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:41,560
<i>and is in a semicoma.
And both pupils are fixed at 0.2.</i>

441
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:43,020
<i>And the patient barely has
any motor skills.</i>

442
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:44,570
I'm nearby. I'll be right there.

443
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:46,280
Let's go.

444
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,050
I took the enhanced brain TC.

445
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:15,260
The bleeding is causing compression
in the brain stem.

446
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:16,510
How old is the patient?

447
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:17,850
Thirteen years old.

448
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,100
It's a 13-year-old girl.

449
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:25,770
GUARDIAN

450
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,120
What is that?

451
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:44,920
Is that a cerebral hemorrhage?

452
00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:47,210
The patient is still young.

453
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:49,630
-Dr. Ahn.
-Yes.

454
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:51,880
Do you see the AVM in her cerebellum?

455
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:53,300
AVM: ARTERIO-VENOUS MALFORMATION

456
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:54,680
Yes, I do.

457
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:57,220
The AVM is ruptured,
so it caused ICH in the cerebellum.

458
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:59,560
She became unconscious and collapsed.
Let's do the surgery.

459
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,560
-Okay.
-Hurry. Get the guardian's consent now,

460
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,980
talk to Anesthesiology
and send her up right away.

461
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:06,270
-I'll talk to her parents.
-Okay, I got it.

462
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:15,990
You startled me.

463
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:18,580
Didn't you go home?
Are you on calls? Do you have an umbrella?

464
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:20,790
I didn't go home.
No, I'm not on calls and no umbrellas.

465
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:22,160
Give me 10,000 won.

466
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:23,910
I don't have any cash.

467
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,380
I had a baseball bet with Gwang-hyeon.
Darn it. NC lost.

468
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:28,420
It could've been
their tenth winning game in a row.

469
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,840
-Pay it back.
-Okay.

470
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:34,760
Give me some cigarettes, too.

471
00:25:40,810 --> 00:25:42,930
You borrowed 10,000 won and 4 cigarettes.

472
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:43,890
And a lighter.

473
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:51,150
You borrowed 10,000 won,
4 cigarettes, and 1 lighter.

474
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:53,190
Hey, it's Gyeo-ul.

475
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,080
What are you doing?

476
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:02,950
What do you think? I lied.

477
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,200
Crazy jerk.

478
00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:05,620
Bye.

479
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:10,250
You borrowed 10,000 won,
4 cigarettes, and 1 lighter.

480
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:11,340
Hold on.

481
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:18,510
<i>You borrowed 10,000 won,
4 cigarettes, and 1 lighter</i>

482
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:21,640
<i>Jessica, only child, Illinois, Chicago</i>

483
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:24,350
<i>Ahn Jeong-won from school
Is such a cheapskate</i>

484
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:30,480
I'm really leaving now.
It's time for the baseball highlight.

485
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,230
That crazy jerk.

486
00:26:56,130 --> 00:26:57,760
Hello, Professor Ahn.

487
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:02,220
See you later at home. Bye.

488
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:23,370
That's a different car, right?

489
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:26,040
Yes. It was a gray sedan yesterday.

490
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,540
Who on earth is Gyeo-ul dating?

491
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:30,210
I don't like his vibe.

492
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:34,460
Doesn't Jeong-won have a car?

493
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:37,380
He does. But it's very sick.

494
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:38,720
It's always at the hospital.

495
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:41,010
Hey, Gyeo-ul. Why are you back?

496
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:42,390
Hello.

497
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:44,010
-Hi.
-Did you forget something?

498
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:45,510
I need to take care of some charts.

499
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,350
I was too busy to do them this afternoon.

500
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:50,060
Since I'm here, I'll look at the baby
in the PICU that had surgery.

501
00:27:50,690 --> 00:27:52,480
Do you want some coffee?
Should I get you one?

502
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:55,400
Yes. But is the cafe still open?

503
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:58,400
There is a convenience store.
I'll get you one.

504
00:27:58,490 --> 00:27:59,570
Go to the PICU.

505
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:00,820
-I'll meet you there.
-Okay.

506
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,120
Here.

507
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,950
Thank you.

508
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:11,750
Right. Here's one more. Ta-da.

509
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:13,830
I could have gotten them myself.

510
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:17,130
I get more discounts.
30 percents. Quite a lot, right?

511
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:23,760
Gyeo-ul.

512
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:25,760
Can I ask you a question?

513
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:29,180
-It's a personal question. Is it okay?
-Okay.

514
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:35,900
What does your boyfriend do?

515
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:40,860
What does he do for a living?
How can he drive different cars every day?

516
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:43,410
Is he a car dealer?
Does he sell imported cars?

517
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:47,950
You only got half right.
The other half is wrong.

518
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,960
THE PATIENT'S SURGERY HAS ENDED
PLEASE COME TO THE OR

519
00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:03,090
Honey.

520
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:09,640
What are you doing still up?

521
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:12,770
My gosh, it's past midnight.

522
00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:14,350
<i>I can't sleep.</i>

523
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:17,690
<i>Did your surgery just finish?
Was it a difficult one?</i>

524
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:20,070
No, the previous surgery
didn't finish on time,

525
00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:21,490
so I started late.

526
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:23,240
<i>You probably didn't eat dinner, then.</i>

527
00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:26,160
I'm going to have <i>ramyeon</i> in the office.

528
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,330
You should go to sleep now.
I'll see you this weekend.

529
00:29:28,410 --> 00:29:29,450
<i>Okay.</i>

530
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:31,580
<i>Bye, Jun-wan.</i>

531
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:33,160
Okay. Sleep tight.

532
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:42,800
You're still here?

533
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,260
Hello.

534
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,130
Hi.

535
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:47,930
-Are you studying?
-No.

536
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:50,720
I just organized my notes I took
this afternoon.

537
00:29:51,010 --> 00:29:53,430
It's getting late. You should go home now.

538
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,140
Okay. I'm done now.

539
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:00,320
Take a taxi. Return my card tomorrow.

540
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,610
No. It's all right.

541
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:03,860
No, take it.

542
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:06,320
My boyfriend is picking me up.

543
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:08,870
He's waiting for me downstairs.

544
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:10,950
Thank you, though.

545
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:18,170
The surgery went well.

546
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:20,790
We did everything we could.

547
00:30:21,170 --> 00:30:24,090
We stopped the brain hemorrhage and
removed the arteriovenous malformation,

548
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:25,510
but the swelling was severe.

549
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:28,550
The bleeding was located deep in the brain
and in an unfavorable spot.

550
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,800
So we need to observe her more.

551
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:32,640
We'll give her medicine to lower

552
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,890
the brain pressure
and keep her in the ICU.

553
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:36,440
Will she regain consciousness?

554
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:38,560
We won't know that now.

555
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:41,980
She was in a life-threatening situation,

556
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:44,190
so it's too early to judge
if she'll wake up or not.

557
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:47,240
We need more time.

558
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:49,450
Bye.

559
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:52,330
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

560
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:11,430
<i>It's raining a lot outside. I'll leave
an umbrella in front of your office.</i>

561
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:13,930
<i>Thank you for today.</i>

562
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:37,040
Hey, what is it?

563
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,910
Why are you calling me at this hour?
What's up?

564
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,880
<i>Must you ask? I'm waiting for you.</i>

565
00:31:42,290 --> 00:31:43,500
You're still here?

566
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:45,500
<i>Where would I go?
You didn't bring your car today.</i>

567
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:47,550
<i>It's raining. How will you get home?</i>

568
00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:48,840
<i>You're done, right?</i>

569
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,630
<i>Come to the ER. I'll pull out the car.</i>

570
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:54,350
Okay. I'll be there soon.

571
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:11,860
That looks like Yun-bok.

572
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:16,870
Why can't you show me?

573
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:20,000
Why do you need to check my phone?

574
00:32:24,170 --> 00:32:25,420
"Are you sleeping?"

575
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:29,260
Doesn't he know what time it is?
Why did he text you at this hour?

576
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:31,260
-"Are you sleeping?"
-Hey.

577
00:32:32,090 --> 00:32:33,930
Did you go through my phone?

578
00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:35,720
Why did you go through my phone?

579
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,810
It popped up right there.
How can I not look?

580
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:40,230
-Give me your phone.
-No.

581
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:42,600
Why not?
You must be hiding something from me.

582
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:44,810
No, I'm not.

583
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:49,190
Then, what about you? Why aren't you
using the cell phone case I got you?

584
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,280
It's a matching case.

585
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,950
It won't fit in here.

586
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:53,240
I take it off when I drive.

587
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:54,280
I need to use GPS.

588
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,700
Where's the case?

589
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:08,420
That bastard.

590
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:10,510
Give me your phone.

591
00:33:11,050 --> 00:33:12,340
What's wrong with you?

592
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:14,220
I told you it's not what you think. No.

593
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:15,300
Then, let me see.

594
00:33:15,390 --> 00:33:17,260
-Let me check.
-I don't want to do.

595
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:19,470
I'll check it and give it back right away.

596
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,810
I told you no. Why do you keep nagging me?

597
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:24,480
Is showing me your phone that hard?

598
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:27,810
Listen. I don't want to show you my phone.

599
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,480
Look. That's the haircut.

600
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,740
That was U-ju when he was two.

601
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:35,740
He looks just like Ik-jun
when he was young.

602
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:37,570
He takes after his grandfather.

603
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:39,950
CAPTAIN HONG JEONG-HO

604
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,160
WHAT ARE YOU DOING THIS WEEKEND?

605
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:48,500
He's Captain Hong in my battalion.

606
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:53,340
This is his habit.
He's like this to everyone.

607
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:56,220
He's friendly to everyone around him.

608
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,140
Do you want to see his texts?

609
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,930
-Look.
-It's fine.

610
00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:01,640
If you say so, then he must be.

611
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:02,890
I don't have to see it.

612
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:06,390
-Are you sure?
-Yes, why would I check your phone?

613
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:12,610
So you want to go for a doctorate?

614
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:14,190
Where's the doctorate program at?

615
00:34:14,650 --> 00:34:17,610
It's either the States or the UK. I don't
know where they'll have an opening.

616
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,120
I'm studying hard,

617
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:23,040
but only one or two people
will get picked.

618
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:26,710
-Do you want to be a professor?
-I might not be as smart as my brother,

619
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:29,580
but I'm pretty smart, too.
I joined the military academy

620
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:30,500
as I'm athletic, too.

621
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:32,050
How long will you stay if you go?

622
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,460
If I get picked,

623
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:37,800
the program will last
at least three to five years.

624
00:34:41,350 --> 00:34:43,390
I guess you have no interest
in getting married.

625
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:50,440
I told you when we first started dating.

626
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:52,770
That I'm not interested
in marriage at all.

627
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:58,860
But you know that this kind
of conversation is pointless, right?

628
00:34:58,950 --> 00:35:01,620
It's really hard to get into this program.

629
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,490
Captains probably have
a higher chance of getting picked.

630
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:06,040
I can't go.

631
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,250
Why can't you?

632
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:09,920
If you don't go, who will?

633
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,630
You can get in.

634
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:13,750
I think you'll get picked.

635
00:35:15,130 --> 00:35:16,260
Really?

636
00:35:18,970 --> 00:35:21,430
Yes, that's right.
I also think I'll get picked.

637
00:35:22,970 --> 00:35:24,100
I'll probably get to go.

638
00:35:27,810 --> 00:35:29,190
If you do go,

639
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,810
does it mean we're breaking up?

640
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,860
If you go abroad for your studies,

641
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:40,360
what will happen to us?

642
00:35:45,290 --> 00:35:47,200
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

643
00:35:48,410 --> 00:35:51,040
Let's eat. They are serving
braised pollack in the cafeteria.

644
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:53,080
-Let's go.
-Easy, easy.

645
00:35:53,170 --> 00:35:55,840
Easy, easy.

646
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:57,920
The choledochal cyst takes place

647
00:35:58,010 --> 00:36:01,050
when there's a cystic dilatation of the
biliary duct, so its function decreases.

648
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:02,890
As a result, this condition

649
00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:06,180
may lead to cholelithiasis
and cholangiocarcinoma.

650
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:08,810
We will make an incision the cyst

651
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:10,980
in the common bile duct in surgery.

652
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:13,650
We will perform
Roux-en-Y choledochojejunostomy

653
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:15,820
to reconstruct the biliary tract.

654
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:17,610
I see.

655
00:36:17,690 --> 00:36:18,740
Hello, ma'am.

656
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:20,740
Hi, Professor.

657
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,450
Jae-won isn't getting a difficult surgery.

658
00:36:23,530 --> 00:36:26,240
Our liver produces something called bile.

659
00:36:26,330 --> 00:36:30,330
This is a type of digestive fluid
that helps break down the grease.

660
00:36:30,410 --> 00:36:33,830
When our liver produces bile,
it moves down to our stomach.

661
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,840
And the passageway to our stomach
is called the common bile duct.

662
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,090
I see.

663
00:36:38,170 --> 00:36:41,930
Most of the kids have
a common bile duct less than 5mm.

664
00:36:42,010 --> 00:36:45,850
But Jae-won's bile duct
is stretched to 3cm.

665
00:36:46,350 --> 00:36:48,430
If it's stretched,

666
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:50,730
the bile can't flow out
and gets stuck in there.

667
00:36:50,810 --> 00:36:54,520
And this may lead to gallstones
and other complications.

668
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:57,940
So we'll cut the stretched part
of the common bile duct.

669
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:00,400
That's the surgery
Jae-won is getting today.

670
00:37:00,490 --> 00:37:01,990
I see. Okay.

671
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:04,030
Of course, after removing it,

672
00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:06,320
he still needs
a passageway for the bile to go through.

673
00:37:06,410 --> 00:37:09,740
So we need to connect a part of his small
intestine with the biliary duct.

674
00:37:09,830 --> 00:37:11,830
And once we connect them together,

675
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:14,000
the surgery will be over.

676
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:16,420
It's not that complicated or difficult.

677
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,290
You don't have to worry that much.

678
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:21,130
I see. Thank you.

679
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:22,970
I totally understood that.

680
00:37:23,050 --> 00:37:25,550
Please take good care of my son. Please.

681
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:26,760
Okay.

682
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:32,140
Hey.

683
00:37:32,810 --> 00:37:34,270
All right. I'll see you guys there.

684
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,520
Okay.

685
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:45,280
Don't laugh like that.
You look like Gargamel.

686
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:46,990
What's so funny?

687
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:50,290
Guys. You know
Professor Cheon Myeong-tae in CS, right?

688
00:37:50,370 --> 00:37:51,790
-No, I don't.
-He's the guy who owns

689
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:53,290
a lot of real estate properties.

690
00:37:53,370 --> 00:37:54,580
That much I know.

691
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:56,330
Jun-wan reported him regarding the rebate.

692
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:57,420
Yes, it's him.

693
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:01,340
Goodness, speak of the devil.

694
00:38:14,770 --> 00:38:16,350
You're even friends with Jae-hak?

695
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:19,770
Yes, I'm also super close
to Dragon in her department.

696
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:21,690
-Who's Dragon?
-Yong Seok-min.

697
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:24,150
You're not close to anyone
in OB-GYN, right?

698
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,400
Of course not. He may have had

699
00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:28,070
a couple of meals with them,
but I'm sure he's not close to anyone.

700
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:30,070
Chu Min-ha and I are besties.

701
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,910
We're going to have <i>tteokbokki</i> together
next week. With Gyeo-ul too.

702
00:38:34,290 --> 00:38:36,040
Hey, Jang Gyeo-ul is busy.

703
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:38,670
I'm busy too, and so are they.
All of us are busy.

704
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:40,630
But they asked me to buy them <i>tteokbokki</i>.

705
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,300
They all like me so much.

706
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:43,760
No, you're just too nosy.

707
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:46,130
Jun-wan, did you hear the news?

708
00:38:46,470 --> 00:38:49,300
Professor Cheon and the CEO of
Jinyong Credit Union are getting married.

709
00:38:49,930 --> 00:38:50,890
Who is he marrying?

710
00:38:50,970 --> 00:38:53,180
Jin Min-ju,
the CEO of Jinyong Credit Union.

711
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:55,430
The self-made entrepreneur. She's loaded.

712
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,600
She's one of the foundation's
board members.

713
00:38:57,690 --> 00:38:59,480
Yes, she's close to the chairman.

714
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:03,820
She's very capable, and I think
she's an all-around wonderful person.

715
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,360
And that's why the chairman is
very concerned at the moment.

716
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:11,160
-Why is he concerned?
-I'm sure he's very worried.

717
00:39:11,410 --> 00:39:13,910
She's a competent businesswoman
and has a great personality,

718
00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:15,200
but she has low standards for men.

719
00:39:15,290 --> 00:39:18,000
Professor Cheon is obviously
after her money,

720
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:20,670
so I bet the chairman is torn
whether or not he should intervene.

721
00:39:21,170 --> 00:39:23,960
-Is he really not a good person?
-That's right. He's a total jerk.

722
00:39:24,050 --> 00:39:25,340
He's really horrible.

723
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:26,840
I'd describe him as a villain.

724
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:29,380
What is a villain?

725
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:32,760
It's a compliment.

726
00:39:33,930 --> 00:39:35,310
Runs to get and pay bills.

727
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,850
It means a hardworking person
who always does his best.

728
00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:39,600
Really?

729
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:42,270
Oh, I have to go do my rounds.
See you later, guys.

730
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:43,400
See you.

731
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:47,190
Otolaryngology and Ophthalmology
will check in as well,

732
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,530
and we'll thoroughly prepare
for your surgery.

733
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,910
-I'll get going.
-Thank you.

734
00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:56,040
Doctor, when can I be discharged?

735
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:58,200
You look like a different person now.

736
00:39:59,290 --> 00:40:01,420
-The urine output has been okay, right?
-Yes.

737
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:03,710
What about her prolactin levels?

738
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:05,170
It's going down.

739
00:40:06,210 --> 00:40:07,550
You can be discharged tomorrow.

740
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:10,800
Just remember that
you shouldn't blow your nose too hard.

741
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,470
Mild exercise is okay,

742
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:15,100
but please stay away
from water exercises for the time being.

743
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:17,640
Dr. Yong will go over everything again
in detail.

744
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,240
Yes?

745
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:34,410
Okay, I'll be right there.

746
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:38,330
You won't need restitching. It looks fine.

747
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:41,960
Thank you. You should get going.
I know you're busy.

748
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,080
Yes, that was from the ER.

749
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:45,670
If you experience any discomfort again,
let us know.

750
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:52,800
Mom, I'm craving <i>tteokbokki</i>.

751
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:55,350
I'll buy you a ton of it
when you get discharged.

752
00:40:55,430 --> 00:40:57,430
I'll buy you everything you want to eat.

753
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:01,060
My baby...

754
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:03,350
Thanks for staying so strong.

755
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:07,980
She seems to be doing much better
than yesterday. Her speech is clearer too.

756
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:09,280
Yes, I know.

757
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:12,200
It's a miracle
that she's already recovered this much.

758
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:15,820
Her cranial nerves are regenerating
very quickly because she's young.

759
00:41:16,370 --> 00:41:18,080
The pressure around the medulla is gone,

760
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,660
and we took care of the bleeding too.

761
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:21,790
Just keep up
with the rehabilitation therapy,

762
00:41:21,870 --> 00:41:24,670
and she'll recover to the point
that it won't affect her day-to-day life.

763
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:27,250
Please don't worry too much.

764
00:41:27,790 --> 00:41:31,090
We should be able to move her
to the regular ward in about two days.

765
00:41:31,170 --> 00:41:34,130
Thank you, Doctor. We owe it all to you.

766
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:35,220
No problem.

767
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:38,640
You haven't been able to go home
for the past few days, right?

768
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:41,180
I saw you sleeping on the chairs at night.

769
00:41:42,350 --> 00:41:43,980
She's passed the critical stage,

770
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:46,060
so you should go home
and sleep comfortably tonight.

771
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:50,070
We were planning
to go home tonight anyway.

772
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:55,320
Our grand opening is tomorrow.

773
00:41:56,410 --> 00:41:58,450
I'm starting a business
in the midst of all this.

774
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:03,290
My mom teaches yoga. She's very famous.

775
00:42:03,870 --> 00:42:04,750
Oh, really?

776
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:07,580
So, you're opening a yoga center?

777
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:11,210
Yes. After working as an instructor
on salary for years,

778
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:13,800
I took out a loan
and opened a yoga center.

779
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:16,090
But a few of members from
the previous center signed up

780
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:18,720
and helped me spread the word,
so I already have many members.

781
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:23,600
They already paid their membership fees,
and some of them are coming from far away,

782
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:25,600
so I couldn't postpone the opening.

783
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:28,350
Knowing that my daughter is in the PICU...

784
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:31,320
I'm not sure if I'm doing the right thing.

785
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,990
Gosh, don't say that.
You need to earn money, of course.

786
00:42:34,650 --> 00:42:37,740
Tae-hui has her dad, you know.
And we'll check in on her often as well.

787
00:42:38,870 --> 00:42:41,780
Doctor, please feel free to visit
my yoga center when you have some time.

788
00:42:42,290 --> 00:42:45,540
I feel like it'll do very well
if you come.

789
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:47,750
Doctor.

790
00:42:48,830 --> 00:42:51,420
You're like a good luck charm
to me and my family.

791
00:42:52,550 --> 00:42:56,130
Whenever you have some free time,
please stop by for a cup of coffee.

792
00:42:56,920 --> 00:43:00,010
She won't have time for that.
She must be always busy.

793
00:43:00,850 --> 00:43:04,850
Doctor, it's okay even if it's
a year later, or three years later.

794
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:06,430
Just visit us anytime.

795
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:09,230
For you, free yoga classes for life.

796
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:12,190
Thank you for saying that.

797
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:14,780
And I really will stop by
when I have some time.

798
00:43:15,530 --> 00:43:16,530
Talk to you soon.

799
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,290
Can you raise this arm for me?

800
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:30,420
Raise this leg for me.

801
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:32,130
This one too.

802
00:43:32,750 --> 00:43:34,630
My head hurts so much, Doctor.

803
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:42,140
When did you get here?

804
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:44,100
I got here a while ago
for another patient.

805
00:43:44,850 --> 00:43:46,180
Do we have the CT angiogram?

806
00:43:47,270 --> 00:43:48,350
That's an aneurysm.

807
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:51,020
-Shave the area for coil embolization.
-Okay.

808
00:43:56,070 --> 00:43:57,110
Yes, hello.

809
00:43:58,690 --> 00:44:00,070
Is the bleeding severe?

810
00:44:01,410 --> 00:44:03,320
Well, I'll go and take a look.

811
00:44:03,910 --> 00:44:04,740
Okay.

812
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,500
Sorry. Call the coil embolization team
and Anesthesiology.

813
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:09,540
-No problem.
-Seong-yeong, can you shave the area

814
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:11,620
-for coil embolization?
-Sure, no problem.

815
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:15,590
Coil embolization?
Then you'll be late for practice.

816
00:44:16,630 --> 00:44:18,170
I won't be late. It'll be done quickly.

817
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:21,180
-What's for dinner?
-Seok-hyeong wants <i>ramyeon</i>.

818
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:24,510
-Shall we get some dumplings and <i>gimbap</i>?
-That's a given.

819
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:27,140
-By the way, where are you headed now?
-The ER.

820
00:44:28,470 --> 00:44:32,230
Oh, Hui-su wants my advice on something.
I think she fought with her sister-in-law.

821
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:34,020
Aren't you busy?

822
00:44:34,110 --> 00:44:36,730
Today is not so bad.
I'll be busy next week though.

823
00:44:36,820 --> 00:44:38,940
U-ju has a field trip,
and I have a lot of lectures.

824
00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:42,450
I'll be busy with surgery as well. Come
with me if you have some time to kill.

825
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:44,490
-I have the coil procedure.
-Oh, right.

826
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:46,120
Move.

827
00:44:47,450 --> 00:44:49,540
PROFESSOR OF CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY
KIM JUN-WAN

828
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:51,120
THERE IS A 20-MINUTE DELAY

829
00:45:00,090 --> 00:45:02,090
PROFESSOR OF CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY
CHEON MYEONG-TAE

830
00:45:02,170 --> 00:45:03,430
NO WAITING PATIENTS

831
00:45:03,510 --> 00:45:06,260
She got a stent put in last year
at a different hospital,

832
00:45:06,350 --> 00:45:07,930
but the symptoms are reoccurring?

833
00:45:08,010 --> 00:45:09,100
Yes.

834
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:13,940
She's been experiencing chest pain
frequently as well as severe constipation.

835
00:45:15,350 --> 00:45:18,270
Doctor, I read in books
and on the Internet

836
00:45:19,530 --> 00:45:21,190
that the medications that are prescribed

837
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:23,780
after a stent procedure
can cause constipation.

838
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:26,160
I read that probiotics can help.

839
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:28,490
Can she take probiotics?

840
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:31,500
-Where do you live?
-We live in Ilsan.

841
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:37,130
Yeongji Hospital in Ilsan is pretty good.
You should take her there.

842
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:38,790
Pardon me?

843
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:41,590
You don't need to tell me
about what you read on the Internet.

844
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:44,510
And you don't need to come
all the way here.

845
00:45:44,590 --> 00:45:46,720
She should just get treated
at a hospital nearby.

846
00:45:47,510 --> 00:45:48,930
Anyway, thank you for coming. Next?

847
00:45:49,970 --> 00:45:51,640
-Was she my last patient for the day?
-Yes.

848
00:45:53,020 --> 00:45:54,190
Take care.

849
00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:01,900
The surgery was done
on the 23rd of last month,

850
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:03,820
so you still have to wait a bit
to give a bath.

851
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:05,700
It healed nicely though.

852
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:07,820
Showers are fine, starting next week.

853
00:46:08,410 --> 00:46:10,410
You can bathe the baby
starting next weekend.

854
00:46:10,490 --> 00:46:11,990
Okay. Got it, Doctor.

855
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:13,790
Thank you.

856
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,250
-One more thing.
-Yes?

857
00:46:15,330 --> 00:46:18,580
When you're using running water,
be gentle with the soap.

858
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:20,250
As for bathing the baby,

859
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:23,670
it'd be best if you could wait
until the scabs fall off naturally.

860
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:26,090
Okay, thank you.

861
00:46:28,550 --> 00:46:29,760
-How many are left?
-Five more.

862
00:46:29,850 --> 00:46:32,560
-You said you have plans this evening.
-It's no problem at all.

863
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:34,640
Professor, I heard
Professor Cheon is already done.

864
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:36,940
It's not even 4 p.m. yet.

865
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:42,480
Everything's ready.

866
00:46:42,650 --> 00:46:45,320
Professor Chae is in her office.
Call her, and she'll come right away.

867
00:46:45,490 --> 00:46:47,030
Thanks for everything.

868
00:46:52,660 --> 00:46:55,200
-We're getting a lot of NS patients today.
-I know.

869
00:46:55,540 --> 00:46:57,580
-Hello.
-Hello.

870
00:46:58,710 --> 00:47:00,580
Seong-yeong, are you done
with the shaving?

871
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:12,230
What's the matter?

872
00:47:12,980 --> 00:47:13,940
What's wrong?

873
00:47:32,550 --> 00:47:34,800
Seong-yeong, spare me a second.

874
00:47:35,510 --> 00:47:36,510
Come on.

875
00:47:42,970 --> 00:47:44,060
What is it?

876
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:52,480
Well...

877
00:47:53,150 --> 00:47:56,820
Professor, we told the patient
that we had to shave his head

878
00:47:56,900 --> 00:48:00,780
in case we might have to perform
another brain surgery

879
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:02,830
in the near future.

880
00:48:03,620 --> 00:48:04,950
-Shut it.
-Okay.

881
00:48:15,710 --> 00:48:18,090
Gosh, you...

882
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:37,900
<i>Patient Oh Yu-min
is really not doing well.</i>

883
00:48:38,530 --> 00:48:40,280
But strangely,
her MELD score is going down.

884
00:48:40,860 --> 00:48:42,320
What do we do? We don't have time.

885
00:48:45,790 --> 00:48:47,120
Do we have her father's address?

886
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,040
Yes, just a moment.

887
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:53,040
My gosh, he's here.

888
00:48:58,670 --> 00:48:59,720
My goodness.

889
00:49:05,850 --> 00:49:08,810
At the top, you see the fetal heart rate.

890
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:11,640
And at the bottom,
you see the mother's contractions.

891
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:14,730
-If you look closely...
-We have a patient with PPH coming in!

892
00:49:22,860 --> 00:49:25,030
Her hemoglobin level is four.

893
00:49:26,490 --> 00:49:27,540
That's too low.

894
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:29,080
Four?

895
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:31,660
What does that mean?

896
00:49:32,250 --> 00:49:34,500
It means that she has lost a lot of blood.

897
00:49:36,380 --> 00:49:37,630
Will she live?

898
00:49:38,210 --> 00:49:39,300
Yes.

899
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:50,350
Are you really the same person?

900
00:49:52,270 --> 00:49:53,270
Yes, Doctor.

901
00:49:54,190 --> 00:49:56,230
I lost 7kg.

902
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:58,860
Not by starving myself.

903
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:02,110
I hired a personal trainer
and worked out six hours a day.

904
00:50:02,740 --> 00:50:04,860
And I've been strictly watching
what I eat.

905
00:50:05,660 --> 00:50:07,410
I predict that I'll probably lose

906
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:11,580
additional 2 to 3kg
in the next week or so.

907
00:50:13,710 --> 00:50:14,710
Doctor.

908
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:19,550
Please allow me to donate my liver.

909
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:23,380
You see,

910
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:25,550
I don't care if I die.

911
00:50:29,930 --> 00:50:31,390
If I can save my daughter,

912
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:35,350
I really don't care what happens to me.

913
00:50:37,270 --> 00:50:39,270
I was so preoccupied
with my business abroad

914
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:41,440
that I neglected

915
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:45,150
my one and only daughter.

916
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:49,330
I had no idea at all until
my daughter was on the brink of death

917
00:50:50,990 --> 00:50:52,910
from alcoholism.

918
00:50:56,250 --> 00:50:57,670
She's in this mess now

919
00:50:59,210 --> 00:51:00,340
all because of me.

920
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:03,510
Had I been there for her,

921
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:06,260
she wouldn't have

922
00:51:07,430 --> 00:51:09,140
ended up like this.

923
00:51:11,140 --> 00:51:12,140
Doctor.

924
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:15,940
I know it's late,
but I want to be a good dad to her now.

925
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:21,150
So please allow me to donate my liver.

926
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:24,650
I'll lose more weight if you tell me to.

927
00:51:25,530 --> 00:51:27,660
And I'll exercise even harder.

928
00:51:29,490 --> 00:51:30,870
Please, Doctor.

929
00:51:32,950 --> 00:51:35,250
Let me donate my liver.

930
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:37,160
Please?

931
00:51:41,380 --> 00:51:42,290
Sir.

932
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,760
According to the rules,
you can't be a donor.

933
00:51:48,340 --> 00:51:50,930
You're above the age limit
to qualify as a donor,

934
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:55,430
and you have a fatty liver. I can't let
you do it if I were to stick to the rules.

935
00:51:57,020 --> 00:51:59,310
And to tell you the truth, I had given up.

936
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:01,520
But seeing you today...

937
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:07,400
I'll muster up some courage.

938
00:52:10,070 --> 00:52:11,200
Let's do it.

939
00:52:13,450 --> 00:52:15,240
I'll order a liver ultrasound
and other tests.

940
00:52:15,330 --> 00:52:17,710
We'll proceed with the surgery
if everything looks good.

941
00:52:19,750 --> 00:52:20,750
Thank you.

942
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,420
Doctor, I really

943
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:25,590
appreciate this.

944
00:52:26,170 --> 00:52:27,550
No, please.

945
00:52:29,260 --> 00:52:33,970
I mean, I should thank you. I'm grateful
to see you again, looking so healthy.

946
00:52:44,570 --> 00:52:47,610
Your son will go through a procedure
called coil embolization.

947
00:52:48,110 --> 00:52:50,740
We'll insert a thin catheter
via a femoral puncture

948
00:52:50,820 --> 00:52:52,410
and guide it up to his cerebral arteries.

949
00:52:52,910 --> 00:52:55,240
Then we'll insert coils
to fill the aneurysm

950
00:52:55,330 --> 00:52:56,990
and close it off.

951
00:52:57,620 --> 00:53:00,660
And to prevent infections,
we have to shave the hair

952
00:53:00,750 --> 00:53:02,750
around the groin area before the surgery.

953
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:06,710
But one of our interns
misunderstood the instructions

954
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:09,420
and shaved his head instead.

955
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:14,600
My instructions weren't clear enough,

956
00:53:14,890 --> 00:53:17,470
so this is my fault. I'm really sorry.

957
00:53:20,140 --> 00:53:22,140
You can claim compensation if you'd like.

958
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:25,360
I promise you
that I'll get this all sorted out for you.

959
00:53:26,860 --> 00:53:27,980
It's okay, Doctor.

960
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:32,320
He may lose his life.

961
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:34,820
Who cares about his hair?

962
00:53:35,410 --> 00:53:36,280
Don't worry about it.

963
00:53:37,580 --> 00:53:38,580
Thank you.

964
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:44,080
Doctor. The surgery won't hurt, right?

965
00:53:44,790 --> 00:53:46,750
It's all good as long as it won't hurt.

966
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:47,920
So please...

967
00:53:49,090 --> 00:53:51,090
Don't be so harsh on the intern.

968
00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:56,470
We'll administer anesthesia,
so you won't feel any pain.

969
00:53:57,350 --> 00:54:00,020
Your thigh might feel a little tight
after the surgery,

970
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:03,390
but I'll tell them
to give you cold compresses.

971
00:54:04,810 --> 00:54:05,690
Thank goodness.

972
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:19,450
-Which song are we practicing today?
-"Met You by Chance."

973
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:21,000
Okay.

974
00:54:23,580 --> 00:54:24,750
What are you doing?

975
00:54:25,330 --> 00:54:27,420
-I'm reflecting on myself.
-What for?

976
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:30,920
For thinking that I knew

977
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:33,630
everything about this world and people.

978
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:40,260
-I'm reflecting on a bunch of stuff.
-What are you talking about?

979
00:54:40,850 --> 00:54:42,930
Can you step aside?
Chi-hong needs to come in.

980
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:46,400
-Hello.
-Hi. What's up?

981
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:48,270
He said he had to ask me something.

982
00:54:50,150 --> 00:54:53,360
Jun-wan, if you have the time,
would you please get lost?

983
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:54,610
It's about a family matter.

984
00:55:25,850 --> 00:55:27,310
You can come in and see Jae-won.

985
00:55:27,390 --> 00:55:29,270
No, it's okay. I saw Jae-won earlier.

986
00:55:29,860 --> 00:55:32,070
It's just that I keep wanting
to see my baby.

987
00:55:33,940 --> 00:55:35,860
The surgery went well, right?

988
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:37,740
Professor Ahn explained everything,

989
00:55:37,820 --> 00:55:40,320
but I wasn't really listening
because I was so out of it earlier.

990
00:55:41,950 --> 00:55:43,160
-Come in for a second.
-Okay.

991
00:55:43,990 --> 00:55:45,330
I was in the OR

992
00:55:45,410 --> 00:55:47,790
to assist Professor Ahn,
so I saw everything.

993
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:53,920
Look.

994
00:55:54,210 --> 00:55:56,880
This is what the common bile duct
normally looks like.

995
00:55:57,470 --> 00:55:58,880
As we explained before the surgery,

996
00:55:58,970 --> 00:56:02,600
this part of Jae-won's common bile duct
was stretched out.

997
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:05,470
First, we cut out the stretched-out part.

998
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:09,060
Then to create a new passageway
for his bile to travel, we connected this

999
00:56:11,810 --> 00:56:13,270
to his small intestine.

1000
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:15,480
The surgery went well.

1001
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:18,860
It's only been a while,
so Jae-won seems to be in a bit of pain.

1002
00:56:18,950 --> 00:56:21,370
But there's no bleeding,
and the urine output is good as well.

1003
00:56:21,950 --> 00:56:23,200
The vitals are very stable too.

1004
00:56:23,450 --> 00:56:25,790
We should be able to send Jae-won
back to the ward tomorrow.

1005
00:56:26,870 --> 00:56:28,460
Thank you, Doctor.

1006
00:56:29,580 --> 00:56:30,960
Thank you so much.

1007
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:32,920
My gosh.

1008
00:56:33,790 --> 00:56:34,960
Thank you.

1009
00:56:46,390 --> 00:56:48,430
Yes, they dated for a long time.
About five years?

1010
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:52,860
But as you know,

1011
00:56:52,940 --> 00:56:54,820
Ik-sun had no interest in getting married.

1012
00:56:55,230 --> 00:56:57,650
But the guy kept asking her to marry him,

1013
00:56:57,780 --> 00:57:00,950
and Ik-sun liked him enough
to change her mind about it,

1014
00:57:01,740 --> 00:57:02,820
so she said yes.

1015
00:57:03,410 --> 00:57:05,330
Anyway, things were fine between them.

1016
00:57:05,410 --> 00:57:08,700
But one day, they went
to see a fortune-teller on a whim.

1017
00:57:09,750 --> 00:57:11,960
Apparently,
the fortune-teller said to Ik-sun

1018
00:57:13,210 --> 00:57:15,340
that she'd destroy his future
if they stayed together.

1019
00:57:15,420 --> 00:57:16,590
What?

1020
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:18,510
She said they're totally incompatible

1021
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:20,970
and that Ik-sun would be like a roadblock
to his future.

1022
00:57:22,550 --> 00:57:24,050
They were told some nonsense like that.

1023
00:57:25,510 --> 00:57:27,970
-And she believed it?
-No, of course not.

1024
00:57:28,970 --> 00:57:31,770
But that would stay
in the back of your mind, you know?

1025
00:57:31,850 --> 00:57:33,810
So the next day,

1026
00:57:34,310 --> 00:57:37,980
Ik-sun made an appointment
with every fortune-teller in the area

1027
00:57:38,230 --> 00:57:41,030
and asked him to come with her
to get that out of their heads.

1028
00:57:41,820 --> 00:57:43,950
-And?
-But that jerk was like...

1029
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:47,160
He said he told his mom about it

1030
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:50,790
and that she is against them
getting married.

1031
00:57:51,620 --> 00:57:53,120
Then he asked her for time apart.

1032
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:56,420
Ik-sun was baffled.

1033
00:57:57,340 --> 00:58:00,050
She was just sitting there,
dazed and confused.

1034
00:58:01,510 --> 00:58:03,880
Then she suddenly got a call
from that guy's mom.

1035
00:58:05,140 --> 00:58:06,220
She answered,

1036
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:10,520
and his mom wanted to hang out
on the weekend.

1037
00:58:13,690 --> 00:58:15,900
In such a happy, jolly voice,

1038
00:58:16,810 --> 00:58:19,650
she asked Ik-sun to join her
on her trip to Sokcho that weekend.

1039
00:58:19,730 --> 00:58:20,940
So he lied.

1040
00:58:22,150 --> 00:58:23,740
He sure did, using his mom as an excuse.

1041
00:58:24,740 --> 00:58:27,410
He didn't know that
his mom and Ik-sun talked often.

1042
00:58:29,030 --> 00:58:32,540
If his feelings had changed,
he should've just been honest with her.

1043
00:58:32,620 --> 00:58:33,830
I mean, he's not a kid.

1044
00:58:35,790 --> 00:58:37,630
Why did she even date
a douchebag like him?

1045
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:42,460
Anyway, she suffered from insomnia
for over six months after that.

1046
00:58:42,970 --> 00:58:44,260
She couldn't even eat,

1047
00:58:45,590 --> 00:58:48,180
and she lost over 5kg during those months.

1048
00:58:49,970 --> 00:58:53,640
I was busy at the hospital back then,
so I couldn't really be there for her.

1049
00:58:54,230 --> 00:58:56,100
Is my dear sister okay now?

1050
00:58:56,690 --> 00:58:59,520
Yes, she seems
to have fully recovered from it.

1051
00:59:00,270 --> 00:59:02,070
Her sense of humor is coming back.

1052
00:59:10,700 --> 00:59:12,450
Anyway, thanks for telling me.

1053
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,870
When I talk to Ik-sun, I'll pretend
not to know anything about this.

1054
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:17,370
Okay, sounds good.

1055
00:59:18,670 --> 00:59:19,750
Professor.

1056
00:59:21,590 --> 00:59:23,960
Please believe me.
Nothing's going on between me and Ik-sun.

1057
00:59:24,050 --> 00:59:25,670
We're really just friends.

1058
00:59:26,550 --> 00:59:29,010
Okay, I heard you. Jeez.

1059
00:59:29,850 --> 00:59:32,850
You have your band practice
later today, right?

1060
00:59:33,390 --> 00:59:35,770
May I stop by next time
and watch you practice?

1061
00:59:35,850 --> 00:59:36,770
Sure!

1062
00:59:37,310 --> 00:59:38,980
You can definitely come, but...

1063
00:59:39,860 --> 00:59:40,940
You like Song-hwa, right?

1064
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:42,860
-I mean, you admire--
-Yes.

1065
00:59:48,030 --> 00:59:49,110
I like her.

1066
00:59:56,790 --> 00:59:58,330
Everyone likes Song-hwa.

1067
00:59:59,420 --> 01:00:00,830
That's why she's always so busy.

1068
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:04,760
Anyway, when those who like her
see her playing her bass guitar...

1069
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:08,720
I'm sure you'll fall for her even more.
She's gotten so much better at it.

1070
01:00:08,970 --> 01:00:10,260
She's such a nerd.

1071
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:14,100
I heard that she had to do
coil embolization. Would she be done?

1072
01:00:14,850 --> 01:00:16,680
Yes, she should be almost done now.

1073
01:00:17,850 --> 01:00:19,100
Good work, everyone.

1074
01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:24,110
I know a good <i>sujebi</i> place nearby.

1075
01:00:24,190 --> 01:00:25,320
-Let's go.
-Okay.

1076
01:00:26,230 --> 01:00:29,280
Professor, you must be exhausted.
Did the surgery go well?

1077
01:00:30,070 --> 01:00:32,530
We struggled to locate
the origin of the bleeding at first,

1078
01:00:32,620 --> 01:00:33,450
but it went well.

1079
01:00:34,030 --> 01:00:35,330
We managed to stop the bleeding,

1080
01:00:35,410 --> 01:00:38,410
so we'll do a transfusion
and see how she recovers.

1081
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:40,750
When you're requesting a CBC,

1082
01:00:40,830 --> 01:00:44,170
order a DIC as well.
And let me know when the results are out.

1083
01:00:44,750 --> 01:00:47,420
Also, she's gotten a lot of blood,
so do a chest X-ray tomorrow.

1084
01:00:47,510 --> 01:00:48,720
Got it.

1085
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:49,880
Professor.

1086
01:00:51,930 --> 01:00:54,970
Did that patient make it?

1087
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:57,270
Of course, she's okay now.

1088
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:00,810
See you tomorrow.

1089
01:01:03,270 --> 01:01:04,360
-See you.
-See you.

1090
01:01:06,020 --> 01:01:07,440
Thank you.

1091
01:01:17,330 --> 01:01:20,000
-We're late.
-All right, okay.

1092
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:21,500
Give me a minute.

1093
01:01:26,130 --> 01:01:27,420
Jeez, I heard you!

1094
01:01:54,990 --> 01:01:56,240
Sorry about that.

1095
01:01:56,370 --> 01:01:59,660
Wait, sir. Your wallet.

1096
01:01:59,750 --> 01:02:00,620
Thank you.

1097
01:02:09,710 --> 01:02:10,710
Hey, what is this?

1098
01:02:13,300 --> 01:02:14,550
<i>Doors are opening.</i>

1099
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:23,100
-Where are you headed?
-<i>Doors are closing.</i>

1100
01:02:23,270 --> 01:02:24,520
-It's a secret.
-What?

1101
01:02:34,450 --> 01:02:36,360
Hey, I'm in the lobby.

1102
01:02:49,460 --> 01:02:50,630
It's understandable.

1103
01:02:50,710 --> 01:02:52,710
He's just a middle-aged man
without his white coat.

1104
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:55,050
I didn't recognize him at all.
What do I do?

1105
01:02:55,260 --> 01:02:57,470
It's okay. Professor Yang is cool
with these things.

1106
01:02:57,550 --> 01:02:58,800
Don't worry about it.

1107
01:02:59,550 --> 01:03:02,220
Girls, the moment
we take off our surgical gowns,

1108
01:03:02,310 --> 01:03:04,850
we're back to being
just like anybody else.

1109
01:03:05,270 --> 01:03:06,230
-Okay.
-Okay.

1110
01:03:06,310 --> 01:03:09,190
I know it can get stressful, but think
that the patients can be your family

1111
01:03:09,270 --> 01:03:10,570
and be patient.

1112
01:03:11,020 --> 01:03:13,490
Give them a second chance
and try to be understanding.

1113
01:03:13,900 --> 01:03:16,200
But no third chance.
Tell your supervisors right away.

1114
01:03:16,490 --> 01:03:17,410
-Okay.
-Okay.

1115
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:22,240
Yeong-ju, did you say
your father is a doctor?

1116
01:03:22,410 --> 01:03:25,910
Yes, but he's getting chemotherapy
after his cancer surgery at the moment.

1117
01:03:27,170 --> 01:03:29,250
My gosh, is he okay?

1118
01:03:29,330 --> 01:03:33,380
Yes! He always bad-mouths
his doctor and the hospital.

1119
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:35,550
He's doing great.

1120
01:03:38,180 --> 01:03:39,930
-Over there.
-Oh, I see them.

1121
01:03:40,260 --> 01:03:42,060
-Seok-hyeong!
-Ik-jun!

1122
01:03:42,140 --> 01:03:43,140
What?

1123
01:03:43,810 --> 01:03:45,810
What? What do you want?

1124
01:03:46,690 --> 01:03:47,690
Sorry about that.

1125
01:03:47,810 --> 01:03:49,190
Hey, dude.

1126
01:03:49,270 --> 01:03:50,810
-You bumped into me.
-I'm hungry.

1127
01:03:50,900 --> 01:03:53,570
-You're at it again.
-Gosh, you started this skit.

1128
01:04:11,210 --> 01:04:12,040
Who's coming?

1129
01:04:17,510 --> 01:04:19,010
I'll get all shy.

1130
01:04:20,140 --> 01:04:21,510
You never let us down. Well done.

1131
01:04:22,050 --> 01:04:23,310
Will he like it though?

1132
01:04:23,810 --> 01:04:24,930
Then my mom will come too.

1133
01:04:30,100 --> 01:04:33,020
Jong-su, when was the last time
you went to a concert?

1134
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:35,440
I don't know what songs
are popular these days.

1135
01:04:36,610 --> 01:04:39,650
Jeong-won, can you guys perform a song
by Moon Ju-ran?

1136
01:04:40,450 --> 01:04:42,030
Or something by Cho Mi-mi.

1137
01:04:42,950 --> 01:04:46,080
We'll kick you out if you're going
to keep making such unreasonable requests.

1138
01:04:46,660 --> 01:04:47,540
All right, fine.

1139
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:49,370
Get started, then.

1140
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:50,920
Yes, sir.

1141
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,380
I'm fine with anything,
but pick something upbeat.

1142
01:04:53,670 --> 01:04:54,960
Pick something exciting, mister.

1143
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,010
"Mister"?

1144
01:04:57,760 --> 01:04:58,970
Yes, ma'am.

1145
01:05:23,780 --> 01:05:27,620
<i>I met you by chance</i>

1146
01:05:27,700 --> 01:05:30,040
<i>And your beauty stole my heart</i>

1147
01:05:31,670 --> 01:05:35,000
<i>I met you by chance</i>

1148
01:05:35,590 --> 01:05:38,130
<i>And your eyes captivated my heart</i>

1149
01:05:39,170 --> 01:05:44,300
<i>There is something I want to tell you</i>

1150
01:05:44,390 --> 01:05:51,060
<i>Why can't I muster up the courage?</i>

1151
01:05:53,770 --> 01:05:57,860
<i>I want to say it to you
But I don't feel confident</i>

1152
01:05:57,940 --> 01:06:00,900
<i>My heart is pounding</i>

1153
01:06:01,950 --> 01:06:05,700
<i>I shall let all this frustration</i>

1154
01:06:05,780 --> 01:06:08,540
<i>Fly away in the wind</i>

1155
01:06:51,870 --> 01:06:53,580
I'm not a kid, Dad.

1156
01:06:53,660 --> 01:06:55,920
I'll just eat it myself.

1157
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,500
To me, you're still a ten-year-old.

1158
01:07:00,630 --> 01:07:02,710
And why do I have to eat porridge?

1159
01:07:03,170 --> 01:07:04,760
I haven't even gotten the surgery yet.

1160
01:07:07,720 --> 01:07:11,890
Dad, I want to eat fried chicken.

1161
01:08:01,360 --> 01:08:05,110
<i>That lady
Who is as beautiful as a blooming flower</i>

1162
01:08:05,190 --> 01:08:07,990
<i>Stole my heart</i>

1163
01:08:09,240 --> 01:08:13,120
<i>Her gorgeous eyes
That sparkle like morning dew</i>

1164
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:15,830
<i>Captivated my heart</i>

1165
01:08:16,700 --> 01:08:22,250
<i>There is something I want to tell you</i>

1166
01:08:22,340 --> 01:08:28,220
<i>Why can't I muster up the courage?</i>

1167
01:08:31,590 --> 01:08:35,600
<i>I want to say it to you
But I don't feel confident</i>

1168
01:08:35,680 --> 01:08:38,560
<i>My heart is pounding</i>

1169
01:08:39,640 --> 01:08:43,310
<i>A fool, such a fool</i>

1170
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:46,780
<i>I must be a fool</i>

1171
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:07,960
<i>There is something I want to tell you</i>

1172
01:09:08,050 --> 01:09:14,970
<i>Why can't I muster up the courage?</i>

1173
01:09:17,560 --> 01:09:21,440
<i>I want to say it to you
But I don't feel confident</i>

1174
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:24,020
<i>My heart is pounding</i>

1175
01:09:25,230 --> 01:09:28,650
<i>A fool, such a fool</i>

1176
01:09:29,240 --> 01:09:33,030
<i>I must be a fool</i>

1177
01:10:02,770 --> 01:10:04,100
That was amazing!

1178
01:10:05,020 --> 01:10:07,110
-Hey! Goodness.
-Gosh, I'm sleepy.

1179
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:16,070
Daddy, take me with you.
I want to go with you.

1180
01:10:16,950 --> 01:10:19,910
Hey, U-ju. I'll see you in the evening.

1181
01:10:19,990 --> 01:10:21,160
You can wait, right?

1182
01:10:23,500 --> 01:10:25,120
Okay, our goodbye ritual.

1183
01:10:26,420 --> 01:10:28,920
There! Okay. See you later.

1184
01:10:59,240 --> 01:11:00,240
My gosh.

1185
01:11:02,160 --> 01:11:03,830
My gosh, Doctor!

1186
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:05,500
You actually came.

1187
01:11:06,290 --> 01:11:09,460
WISHING YOU ABUNDANCE OF PROSPERITY
CHAE SONG-HWA

1188
01:11:10,040 --> 01:11:11,460
Congratulations on your opening.

1189
01:11:12,340 --> 01:11:13,380
Thank you.

1190
01:11:14,170 --> 01:11:16,430
Honey, Dr. Chae is here. Come on out!

1191
01:11:16,510 --> 01:11:20,350
No, that's okay. I can't stay anyway.

1192
01:11:20,430 --> 01:11:23,100
I'm meeting someone in the area,
so I wanted to stop by.

1193
01:11:26,230 --> 01:11:27,900
Have a great day.

1194
01:11:44,790 --> 01:11:46,460
<i>A guy is here to see you.</i>

1195
01:11:46,910 --> 01:11:49,380
<i>He seemed to be in his late 30s,</i>

1196
01:11:50,210 --> 01:11:51,130
<i>and he's handsome.</i>

1197
01:11:58,550 --> 01:11:59,640
What the...

1198
01:12:14,190 --> 01:12:15,030
Surprised to see me?

1199
01:12:18,280 --> 01:12:19,320
You're no fun.

1200
01:12:20,240 --> 01:12:23,160
This one is for spicy fish stew.
All the ingredients are ready to go,

1201
01:12:23,240 --> 01:12:24,700
so just boil them with the sauce.

1202
01:12:24,790 --> 01:12:28,790
In this one, you'll find different kinds
of tripe. They're raw, so grill them.

1203
01:12:28,870 --> 01:12:30,420
You have to grill them, okay?

1204
01:12:30,670 --> 01:12:34,130
This is <i>sundae</i> and organ meats.
Things like the ears, liver, lung,

1205
01:12:34,210 --> 01:12:36,510
intestines, kidneys, and so on.

1206
01:12:36,590 --> 01:12:38,550
They're cooked,
so you can eat them right away.

1207
01:12:43,390 --> 01:12:45,850
-Did something happen?
-No, not at all.

1208
01:12:45,930 --> 01:12:47,930
-Are you getting remarried?
-No.

1209
01:12:48,020 --> 01:12:50,190
-Is Mom ill?
-No, she's fine.

1210
01:12:50,270 --> 01:12:52,650
-Is Dad ill?
-Jeez, I just came to see you.

1211
01:12:52,730 --> 01:12:54,570
-Are you ill?
-Gosh, I'm off.

1212
01:12:54,650 --> 01:12:56,780
I promised U-ju
I'd take him out for <i>tonkatsu</i>.

1213
01:12:56,860 --> 01:12:58,700
I just stopped by on the way
to give you these.

1214
01:12:58,780 --> 01:13:00,610
-Where's the restaurant?
-In Apgujeong-dong.

1215
01:13:03,870 --> 01:13:05,660
I just came to see you, okay?

1216
01:13:08,790 --> 01:13:09,790
You've been well, right?

1217
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:12,000
Yes.

1218
01:13:13,210 --> 01:13:14,710
I've been well. What about you?

1219
01:13:14,790 --> 01:13:16,420
I'm always well.

1220
01:13:16,710 --> 01:13:19,300
I'm sorry for not visiting you often
and not taking

1221
01:13:21,010 --> 01:13:22,390
better care of you.

1222
01:13:29,930 --> 01:13:31,190
Bye.

1223
01:13:35,770 --> 01:13:37,820
I should give you some spending money.

1224
01:13:38,990 --> 01:13:39,990
Here.

1225
01:13:42,820 --> 01:13:44,410
What?

1226
01:13:45,160 --> 01:13:46,450
Are you crying?

1227
01:13:48,910 --> 01:13:50,540
Gosh, what is wrong with me?

1228
01:13:53,790 --> 01:13:55,250
You're nuts.

1229
01:13:55,330 --> 01:13:57,210
I'm off. Take it easy.

1230
01:13:58,420 --> 01:14:00,760
Call me if you're ever stressed out.

1231
01:14:01,010 --> 01:14:05,180
I'm not busy at all,
so you can call me anytime.

1232
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:07,890
I'm off, for real this time.

1233
01:14:32,870 --> 01:14:39,130
Subtitle translation by Won-hyang Son

1234
01:14:54,600 --> 01:14:56,310
Okay. We'll go together.

1235
01:14:56,400 --> 01:14:58,360
I have to go
if my girlfriend wants me to go.

1236
01:14:58,440 --> 01:15:00,400
<i>They're all nice people.</i>

1237
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:01,480
-Hello.
-Hello.

1238
01:15:01,980 --> 01:15:02,940
What is this?

1239
01:15:03,030 --> 01:15:06,320
<i>I guess you really want to see
the end of me.</i>

1240
01:15:06,410 --> 01:15:09,160
Ik-jun, how about a drink with me tonight?

1241
01:15:09,240 --> 01:15:11,080
What? What's going on?

1242
01:15:11,660 --> 01:15:14,290
<i>I'd be a shame for Jeong-won
to quit his job as a doctor.</i>

1243
01:15:14,370 --> 01:15:16,290
<i>There aren't a lot of doctors like him.</i>

1244
01:15:16,370 --> 01:15:18,840
What's up with your kids?

1245
01:15:18,920 --> 01:15:21,880
Our dear Gyeo-ul must be dating someone!

1246
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:22,800
Really?

1247
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:25,470
If you like her, say so.
I'll keep it a secret.

1248
01:15:25,680 --> 01:15:27,260
Jeong-won hasn't gone home yet.

1249
01:15:27,340 --> 01:15:28,430
I have to see a patient.

1250
01:15:28,510 --> 01:15:30,760
-I'll stay here.
<i>-Professor, by any chance...</i>

1251
01:15:31,640 --> 01:15:33,310
<i>You're not being jealous, are you?</i>

1252
01:15:33,390 --> 01:15:34,980
<i>-No, I didn't.
-Yes, you did.</i>

1253
01:15:35,060 --> 01:15:36,940
No! When? What time?

1254
01:15:37,020 --> 01:15:39,110
<i>It's nice if you can rely on each other.</i>

1255
01:15:40,270 --> 01:15:41,190
Later.

1256
01:15:41,320 --> 01:15:44,530
I'll tell you guys at once
when we're all together.

1257
01:15:46,490 --> 01:15:48,780
<i>-Who?
-Who's going to do the surgery?</i>

1258
01:15:48,870 --> 01:15:49,740
<i>It'll be burdensome.</i>

1259
01:15:49,820 --> 01:15:52,700
It's a given to do well. If not,
it'll harm the hospital's reputation.

1260
01:15:52,790 --> 01:15:55,200
<i>The patient's condition is really bad
due to chronic rejection.</i>

1261
01:15:55,290 --> 01:15:58,040
I won't do it. I don't want to.

1262
01:15:58,670 --> 01:15:59,960
<i>Don't do it if you don't want to.</i>

1263
01:16:00,540 --> 01:16:02,000
I've told you though.

1264
01:16:02,500 --> 01:16:05,340
The patient says no,
and Professor Cheon says to follow it.

1265
01:16:05,420 --> 01:16:06,840
If I had an excuse,

1266
01:16:06,920 --> 01:16:08,760
<i>I don't want to proceed
a high risk operation</i>

1267
01:16:09,340 --> 01:16:10,430
<i>It's not up to you.</i>

1268
01:16:10,510 --> 01:16:12,310
It's up to the doctor.

1269
01:16:12,890 --> 01:16:15,060
<i>Professor. What do I do?</i>

1270
01:16:15,140 --> 01:16:17,440
We must protect the baby
who came to us this time.

1271
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:19,270
<i>If the doctor gives up on the patient,</i>

1272
01:16:19,940 --> 01:16:21,150
<i>he isn't a doctor anymore.</i>
