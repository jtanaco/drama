1
00:00:11,957 --> 00:00:13,926
<b>Seo Woo, come here.</b>

2
00:00:16,626 --> 00:00:18,237
<b>Give me your opinion.</b>

3
00:00:22,036 --> 00:00:25,106
<b>People that my grandmother sponsors...</b>

4
00:00:25,106 --> 00:00:27,676
<b>send letters of appreciation,</b>

5
00:00:28,047 --> 00:00:30,547
<b>so I put them in Uncle's and my addresses.</b>

6
00:00:30,746 --> 00:00:34,486
<b>I never read them, so I didn't know,</b>

7
00:00:34,687 --> 00:00:38,287
<b>but Kim Ji Soo had written to that address.</b>

8
00:00:43,287 --> 00:00:45,026
<b>It's okay.</b>

9
00:00:46,927 --> 00:00:49,526
<b>I guess you don't read the letters.</b>

10
00:00:50,937 --> 00:00:54,007
<b>If you had, you would've called right away.</b>

11
00:00:54,937 --> 00:00:56,437
<b>Ms. Moon.</b>

12
00:00:56,937 --> 00:01:01,107
<b>I found out why Won's mom died.</b>

13
00:01:01,647 --> 00:01:04,916
<b>It wasn't the blizzard.</b>

14
00:01:06,416 --> 00:01:08,617
<b>My husband was involved.</b>

15
00:01:09,546 --> 00:01:12,957
<b>I became miserable, but I didn't call him.</b>

16
00:01:13,317 --> 00:01:15,186
<b>I won't. I will never.</b>

17
00:01:15,186 --> 00:01:17,227
<b>Do you know why? Because...</b>

18
00:01:17,927 --> 00:01:19,957
<b>My husband...</b>

19
00:01:20,966 --> 00:01:23,227
<b>He made a mistake.</b>

20
00:01:25,336 --> 00:01:27,636
<b>It's too much to bear on my own.</b>

21
00:01:28,207 --> 00:01:30,267
<b>I want to tell the world,</b>

22
00:01:31,106 --> 00:01:33,076
<b>but I can't.</b>

23
00:01:35,306 --> 00:01:37,177
<b>That's why I'm writing you like this.</b>

24
00:01:38,477 --> 00:01:41,946
<b>With the assurance that it will never be read.</b>

25
00:01:42,546 --> 00:01:43,886
<b>What should I do?</b>

26
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:47,287
<b>Does your uncle know about this letter?</b>

27
00:01:47,287 --> 00:01:49,356
<b>No, he doesn't.</b>

28
00:01:50,056 --> 00:01:53,397
<b>Only that Ji Soo knows something about his mom's death.</b>

29
00:01:53,397 --> 00:01:56,996
<b>She must have sent a lot of letters. Seriously, that girl...</b>

30
00:01:59,466 --> 00:02:02,907
<b>One. Catch Ji Soo's husband and kill him.</b>

31
00:02:02,907 --> 00:02:05,237
<b>Two. Two...</b>

32
00:02:05,907 --> 00:02:07,177
<b>He can't find out.</b>

33
00:02:08,477 --> 00:02:09,907
<b>Why do you think that?</b>

34
00:02:11,146 --> 00:02:13,877
<b>Ji Soo didn't tell him, so he shouldn't find out.</b>

35
00:02:15,116 --> 00:02:16,386
<b>She did tell him.</b>

36
00:02:16,546 --> 00:02:17,986
<b>She wrote it.</b>

37
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:32,337
<b>Ji Soo.</b>

38
00:02:33,467 --> 00:02:37,136
<b>You found out but hid it desperately,</b>

39
00:02:39,337 --> 00:02:41,347
<b>so I won't try to find out.</b>

40
00:02:43,146 --> 00:02:45,446
<b>What did you find out that made you so miserable?</b>

41
00:02:46,377 --> 00:02:47,516
<b>Tell me...</b>

42
00:02:48,817 --> 00:02:50,817
<b>much later when we meet again.</b>

43
00:02:52,557 --> 00:02:54,727
<b>If we can't cry together,</b>

44
00:02:55,687 --> 00:02:57,227
<b>let's stay ignorant as you wanted.</b>

45
00:02:58,956 --> 00:03:01,396
<b>I'll do my best not to find out.</b>

46
00:03:05,097 --> 00:03:08,636
<b>(A Piece of Your Mind)</b>

47
00:03:09,837 --> 00:03:11,037
<b>(Episode 10)</b>

48
00:03:13,837 --> 00:03:16,676
<b>No. He has to know.</b>

49
00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:20,277
<b>I really think Uncle should know.</b>

50
00:03:20,277 --> 00:03:21,886
<b>We can't keep quiet about this.</b>

51
00:03:26,657 --> 00:03:28,856
<b>- Seo Woo. - Your uncle...</b>

52
00:03:29,856 --> 00:03:30,896
<b>can never find out.</b>

53
00:03:35,366 --> 00:03:36,497
<b>I feel sick.</b>

54
00:03:45,377 --> 00:03:47,176
<b>Seo Woo, are you okay?</b>

55
00:03:49,076 --> 00:03:51,176
<b>When I first saw Ji Soo,</b>

56
00:03:51,747 --> 00:03:54,046
<b>she was barely surviving day to day.</b>

57
00:03:55,486 --> 00:03:58,187
<b>As though everything would be fine if she endured it.</b>

58
00:03:59,356 --> 00:04:02,657
<b>She made her decision and worked hard to stick to it.</b>

59
00:04:03,257 --> 00:04:04,956
<b>We should respect that.</b>

60
00:04:05,296 --> 00:04:07,896
<b>Are you saying you'll keep that secret for her now?</b>

61
00:04:09,027 --> 00:04:11,337
<b>Do you like my uncle even after you got to know Ji Soo?</b>

62
00:04:14,307 --> 00:04:15,967
<b>It's such a small world.</b>

63
00:04:15,967 --> 00:04:17,537
<b>And the studio is even smaller.</b>

64
00:04:18,876 --> 00:04:21,147
<b>Still, I'm glad it's you.</b>

65
00:04:30,046 --> 00:04:31,186
<b>It's just as I said.</b>

66
00:04:32,457 --> 00:04:34,926
<b>Mr. Kang's wife passed away,</b>

67
00:04:35,126 --> 00:04:36,727
<b>and so he blamed himself.</b>

68
00:04:37,496 --> 00:04:39,556
<b>He said she was on a trip and whatnot.</b>

69
00:04:39,756 --> 00:04:41,126
<b>He hid it, was sad and miserable...</b>

70
00:04:41,126 --> 00:04:43,426
<b>all by his lonesome, which was why he fell into a slump.</b>

71
00:04:43,897 --> 00:04:45,236
<b>He didn't want to believe it,</b>

72
00:04:45,236 --> 00:04:46,767
<b>so no wonder he didn't want to talk about it.</b>

73
00:04:47,837 --> 00:04:49,436
<b>I think I'm the only one he told,</b>

74
00:04:49,436 --> 00:04:50,876
<b>but you need to know.</b>

75
00:04:51,037 --> 00:04:52,876
<b>That way, you can understand him.</b>

76
00:04:54,506 --> 00:04:56,947
<b>I thought I should watch him pull off everything...</b>

77
00:04:57,106 --> 00:04:59,546
<b>from his music video to his recitals...</b>

78
00:04:59,717 --> 00:05:02,746
<b>to eventually returning to being a classical pianist.</b>

79
00:05:03,087 --> 00:05:05,387
<b>It was quite rewarding...</b>

80
00:05:05,387 --> 00:05:07,116
<b>to help him get over his slump.</b>

81
00:05:08,087 --> 00:05:09,657
<b>It has been a while since life felt worth living.</b>

82
00:05:11,556 --> 00:05:14,796
<b>By any chance...</b>

83
00:05:18,767 --> 00:05:19,866
<b>Do I have feelings for him?</b>

84
00:05:21,006 --> 00:05:22,407
<b>You're in no position to worry about me.</b>

85
00:05:23,407 --> 00:05:25,477
<b>I think I already have something to worry about.</b>

86
00:05:26,176 --> 00:05:27,546
<b>Just find my uncle.</b>

87
00:05:47,426 --> 00:05:49,397
<b>I think Ha Won may come.</b>

88
00:07:36,436 --> 00:07:37,606
<b>I finally get to see you.</b>

89
00:08:12,477 --> 00:08:14,137
<b>So you worked at a hotel.</b>

90
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:17,207
<b>I've never slept at a hotel before.</b>

91
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:18,517
<b>Don't make me laugh.</b>

92
00:08:19,147 --> 00:08:21,847
<b>You went on a trip to Jeju Island with your family in middle school.</b>

93
00:08:22,546 --> 00:08:24,816
<b>You went around in the hotel slippers...</b>

94
00:08:24,816 --> 00:08:26,717
<b>and bragged so much about it.</b>

95
00:08:27,587 --> 00:08:28,626
<b>Right, right.</b>

96
00:08:32,626 --> 00:08:33,656
<b>What about Chang Sup?</b>

97
00:08:34,297 --> 00:08:36,266
<b>I don't care how he's doing.</b>

98
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:38,097
<b>I'm not curious how he's doing.</b>

99
00:08:39,067 --> 00:08:40,266
<b>Is it over?</b>

100
00:08:43,467 --> 00:08:44,937
<b>Never mind if you don't want to tell me.</b>

101
00:08:46,876 --> 00:08:50,376
<b>There was a girl whom I wondered how she could bear living.</b>

102
00:08:51,047 --> 00:08:53,616
<b>But seeing how well she endured,</b>

103
00:08:54,116 --> 00:08:55,917
<b>I looked at her every time life got too hard.</b>

104
00:08:56,947 --> 00:08:58,616
<b>I thought of how brave she was.</b>

105
00:09:01,016 --> 00:09:05,396
<b>Compared to her, my struggles were nothing.</b>

106
00:09:05,396 --> 00:09:06,496
<b>Is that girl Han Seo Woo?</b>

107
00:09:07,126 --> 00:09:08,927
<b>- No comment. - Goodness.</b>

108
00:09:11,337 --> 00:09:13,837
<b>I felt sad...</b>

109
00:09:15,266 --> 00:09:16,807
<b>and wronged.</b>

110
00:09:18,106 --> 00:09:20,036
<b>I felt sad again.</b>

111
00:09:20,776 --> 00:09:22,746
<b>Then I was fine.</b>

112
00:09:23,347 --> 00:09:26,876
<b>I tell myself, "Right, this isn't a matter of life and death."</b>

113
00:09:27,077 --> 00:09:28,717
<b>That's where I am right now.</b>

114
00:09:32,486 --> 00:09:34,526
<b>What was your daughter's name?</b>

115
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:39,597
<b>Never mind if you don't want to talk about it.</b>

116
00:09:46,036 --> 00:09:47,297
<b>Min Jung.</b>

117
00:09:50,707 --> 00:09:52,077
<b>You went through so much.</b>

118
00:09:53,837 --> 00:09:55,047
<b>You did well.</b>

119
00:10:04,616 --> 00:10:05,756
<b>From now on,</b>

120
00:10:06,817 --> 00:10:08,286
<b>when things are hard,</b>

121
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:10,756
<b>think of Han Seo Woo...</b>

122
00:10:11,697 --> 00:10:14,156
<b>and remind yourself, "Even Min Jung is hanging on."</b>

123
00:10:15,927 --> 00:10:17,526
<b>It will give you energy.</b>

124
00:10:23,337 --> 00:10:24,366
<b>Come on.</b>

125
00:10:34,847 --> 00:10:37,016
<b>I got different kinds of beer. Will you let me join you?</b>

126
00:10:38,256 --> 00:10:40,417
<b>Alcohol.</b>

127
00:10:40,417 --> 00:10:41,457
<b>You're silly.</b>

128
00:10:42,386 --> 00:10:43,457
<b>Did you hear what she said?</b>

129
00:10:45,097 --> 00:10:47,526
<b>- Say that again. - Alcohol!</b>

130
00:10:48,026 --> 00:10:50,697
<b>My gosh, it wasn't there when I went to the store.</b>

131
00:10:50,827 --> 00:10:53,067
<b>- Really? - This one is good, isn't it?</b>

132
00:10:53,067 --> 00:10:55,766
<b>Hey! Don't drink without eating anything!</b>

133
00:10:55,766 --> 00:10:57,467
<b>This is why you got dumped.</b>

134
00:11:10,947 --> 00:11:12,587
<b>This should be good enough.</b>

135
00:11:18,297 --> 00:11:19,526
<b>I'll make sure...</b>

136
00:11:20,756 --> 00:11:22,597
<b>to see you fall asleep before I leave.</b>

137
00:11:22,597 --> 00:11:23,727
<b>Why don't you live here?</b>

138
00:11:26,797 --> 00:11:28,236
<b>Come here after work.</b>

139
00:11:29,506 --> 00:11:31,337
<b>I'll be here when you return.</b>

140
00:11:32,837 --> 00:11:34,847
<b>When I come, you'll be here.</b>

141
00:11:35,847 --> 00:11:37,847
<b>I don't want you to stay in that semi-basement room alone.</b>

142
00:11:40,077 --> 00:11:41,947
<b>I don't want...</b>

143
00:11:43,116 --> 00:11:45,856
<b>to come here alone, sit anywhere,</b>

144
00:11:46,557 --> 00:11:48,327
<b>and toss and turn all night either.</b>

145
00:11:50,087 --> 00:11:51,656
<b>If we keep doing this,</b>

146
00:11:51,656 --> 00:11:52,827
<b>you might do something rash.</b>

147
00:11:58,297 --> 00:11:59,667
<b>If you need time,</b>

148
00:12:00,766 --> 00:12:02,036
<b>- from tomorrow on... - From...</b>

149
00:12:03,236 --> 00:12:04,337
<b>now on.</b>

150
00:12:20,786 --> 00:12:23,227
<b>I need to tell Eun Joo in person.</b>

151
00:12:23,286 --> 00:12:25,927
<b>She'll be very hurt if I just text her.</b>

152
00:12:26,557 --> 00:12:27,856
<b>I'll let her know first,</b>

153
00:12:29,097 --> 00:12:32,697
<b>and I'll take my spoon, lounge clothes, and...</b>

154
00:12:33,036 --> 00:12:34,396
<b>What else do I need to bring?</b>

155
00:12:34,606 --> 00:12:36,807
<b>- Are you sure you can tell her? - Of course.</b>

156
00:12:37,136 --> 00:12:39,437
<b>Eun Joo supports this kind of life.</b>

157
00:12:42,207 --> 00:12:44,717
<b>What if you can't come back within the count of 10?</b>

158
00:12:45,577 --> 00:12:47,616
<b>- Then? - Come tomorrow.</b>

319
00:29:08,857 --> 00:29:10,566
<b>Seo Woo is crazy strong.</b>

320
00:29:11,026 --> 00:29:13,066
<b>I drove her home with all her stuff today.</b>

321
00:29:13,266 --> 00:29:16,407
<b>Seo Woo's home? Do you mean the homestay?</b>

322
00:29:16,707 --> 00:29:17,766
<b>In Wokin-dong.</b>

323
00:29:19,677 --> 00:29:20,707
<b>Wokin-dong?</b>

324
00:29:23,006 --> 00:29:24,447
<b>It's a sentimental town.</b>

325
00:29:25,977 --> 00:29:28,917
<b>It has a sentimental meaning for my uncle and me.</b>

326
00:29:29,586 --> 00:29:30,617
<b>Your uncle?</b>

327
00:29:31,717 --> 00:29:34,117
<b>- Your uncle? - Are you curious?</b>

328
00:29:35,727 --> 00:29:38,826
<b>Well... I think this is the first you've spoken of your family.</b>

329
00:29:40,857 --> 00:29:42,496
<b>My grandmother adopted him.</b>

330
00:29:42,727 --> 00:29:45,897
<b>We're about the same age. He's like my best friend.</b>

331
00:29:47,496 --> 00:29:49,036
<b>Maybe it's his house.</b>

332
00:29:49,437 --> 00:29:51,736
<b>Why would Seo Woo go to your uncle's house?</b>

333
00:29:52,336 --> 00:29:53,377
<b>The thing is...</b>

334
00:29:54,207 --> 00:29:56,677
<b>- they're going out. - I see.</b>

335
00:29:57,607 --> 00:29:59,746
<b>I thought she never dated before. She had me fooled.</b>

336
00:30:01,316 --> 00:30:02,887
<b>I only recently found out myself.</b>

337
00:30:02,887 --> 00:30:04,986
<b>I saw Seo Woo every day,</b>

338
00:30:05,147 --> 00:30:07,617
<b>and I was closer to my uncle than anyone else.</b>

339
00:30:08,117 --> 00:30:10,786
<b>But they're what? I was mad at first,</b>

340
00:30:12,857 --> 00:30:13,996
<b>but I liked it.</b>

341
00:30:15,596 --> 00:30:17,667
<b>It made me happy once I found out.</b>

342
00:30:18,427 --> 00:30:19,596
<b>That's what matters.</b>

343
00:30:20,536 --> 00:30:23,806
<b>The person you see every day has a life you are unaware of.</b>

344
00:30:23,806 --> 00:30:25,407
<b>It's totally possible.</b>

345
00:30:25,736 --> 00:30:27,707
<b>I guess my wife could've had one too.</b>

346
00:30:39,586 --> 00:30:40,586
<b>Soon Ho.</b>

347
00:30:42,486 --> 00:30:45,357
<b>I have yet to give a recital that I truly wanted.</b>

348
00:30:47,056 --> 00:30:48,727
<b>And I never will.</b>

349
00:30:51,096 --> 00:30:52,667
<b>This upcoming recital...</b>

350
00:30:55,596 --> 00:30:56,766
<b>is the most humiliating.</b>

351
00:30:58,367 --> 00:30:59,377
<b>Why?</b>

352
00:31:00,437 --> 00:31:02,546
<b>I'm doing it to thank you for all your hard work.</b>

353
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:11,717
<b>Once you receive the applause, the support,</b>

354
00:31:12,617 --> 00:31:14,157
<b>and finish the recital,</b>

355
00:31:14,986 --> 00:31:17,826
<b>you'll grow to love the piece that you wrote,</b>

356
00:31:18,427 --> 00:31:19,897
<b>your recital,</b>

357
00:31:21,556 --> 00:31:23,167
<b>the hard times, everything.</b>

358
00:31:27,296 --> 00:31:28,397
<b>You can do it.</b>

359
00:31:44,217 --> 00:31:45,346
<b>(From Kim Ji Soo)</b>

360
00:31:46,657 --> 00:31:50,026
<b>Ji Soo, I guess it's not time yet.</b>

361
00:31:58,026 --> 00:31:59,137
<b>It crumbled.</b>

362
00:31:59,996 --> 00:32:02,397
<b>The promise I wanted to keep with all my might...</b>

363
00:32:03,506 --> 00:32:04,806
<b>crumbled...</b>

364
00:32:05,836 --> 00:32:07,177
<b>to pieces.</b>

365
00:32:08,006 --> 00:32:09,076
<b>What will you do?</b>

366
00:32:14,016 --> 00:32:15,346
<b>Kang In Wook.</b>

367
00:32:18,217 --> 00:32:20,016
<b>I'll have to ask Kang In Wook...</b>

368
00:32:21,657 --> 00:32:23,526
<b>whether he had something to do with my mom's death.</b>

369
00:32:25,326 --> 00:32:26,897
<b>Do you think he'll tell you?</b>

370
00:32:30,927 --> 00:32:32,967
<b>I'll have to ask even if I end up wasting my time.</b>

371
00:32:56,627 --> 00:32:58,326
<b>(Messages, Before Dawn)</b>

372
00:32:58,326 --> 00:32:59,427
<b>There's no one here.</b>

373
00:33:15,177 --> 00:33:17,177
<b>- I'm here. - Where?</b>

374
00:33:17,877 --> 00:33:20,217
<b>I can't even find my seat in theaters once the lights are out.</b>

375
00:33:21,316 --> 00:33:22,447
<b>You haven't changed.</b>

376
00:33:23,687 --> 00:33:24,717
<b>Found you.</b>

377
00:33:25,486 --> 00:33:26,717
<b>I found you.</b>

378
00:33:30,127 --> 00:33:31,657
<b>Do you have to go to the studio?</b>

379
00:33:31,657 --> 00:33:33,756
<b>I can't for a few days.</b>

380
00:33:33,756 --> 00:33:36,697
<b>A friend asked me to help out here, so I have to be here.</b>

381
00:33:37,467 --> 00:33:38,667
<b>That's a relief.</b>

382
00:33:38,996 --> 00:33:40,167
<b>A relief?</b>

383
00:33:42,197 --> 00:33:44,836
<b>Did you come here just to ask me that?</b>

384
00:33:46,477 --> 00:33:47,707
<b>That's part of the reason.</b>

385
00:33:48,836 --> 00:33:51,246
<b>I'm going to be very busy for a few days.</b>

386
00:33:51,546 --> 00:33:53,417
<b>So much that I can't go to the house.</b>

387
00:33:54,016 --> 00:33:55,816
<b>It's unacceptable.</b>

388
00:33:56,746 --> 00:33:59,147
<b>I'll go to you whenever I have time.</b>

389

<b>And...</b>

390

<b>even if you fight with Soon Ho, don't quit.</b>

391

<b>You got that job with your skill.</b>

<b>Don't budge even if she pushes you out.</b>

393

<b>Why are you saying that?</b>

394
00:34:16,667 --> 00:34:19,036
<b>Don't let little things affect you.</b>

395

<b>(Uncle)</b>

396
00:34:36,587 --> 00:34:40,096
<b>Sorry about yesterday. Kang In Wook suddenly came.</b>

397
00:34:40,096 --> 00:34:41,457
<b>Did you wait long?</b>

398
00:34:41,556 --> 00:34:44,266
<b>Did you make progress with him?</b>

399
00:34:44,266 --> 00:34:46,596
<b>Yes. Why?</b>

400
00:34:47,567 --> 00:34:49,266
<b>Do you know much about him?</b>

401
00:34:51,207 --> 00:34:54,406
<b>Do you know Seo Woo? Is that why you like her?</b>

402
00:34:56,346 --> 00:34:57,746
<b>I know enough.</b>

403
00:34:59,716 --> 00:35:03,016
<b>I know all of his weaknesses, flaws, and anxieties.</b>

404
00:35:03,016 --> 00:35:04,487
<b>I like him anyway.</b>

405
00:35:06,857 --> 00:35:08,087
<b>What if I'm against it?</b>

406
00:35:08,087 --> 00:35:09,487
<b>If you're against it?</b>

407
00:35:09,757 --> 00:35:12,996
<b>Then I wouldn't pursue it. I listen.</b>

408
00:35:13,056 --> 00:35:14,727
<b>So go ahead and oppose.</b>

409
00:35:14,727 --> 00:35:18,067
<b>Insist, complain, and whine. Go ahead and do that.</b>

410
00:35:18,067 --> 00:35:19,636
<b>Like you'd ever.</b>

411
00:35:21,866 --> 00:35:25,036
<b>I'd like to meet Kang In Wook. Alone.</b>

412
00:35:25,667 --> 00:35:27,636
<b>That would be too awkward.</b>

413
00:35:28,176 --> 00:35:30,306
<b>Isn't he going to the studio today?</b>

414
00:35:30,647 --> 00:35:32,746
<b>He'll probably come tomorrow evening.</b>

415
00:35:33,377 --> 00:35:36,647
<b>I'll introduce you formally. You can't meet at the studio.</b>

416
00:35:36,917 --> 00:35:39,386
<b>I'll meet him alone first. We can all meet again another time.</b>

417
00:35:39,386 --> 00:35:42,857
<b>I see. You want to act like my uncle, is that it?</b>

418
00:35:42,857 --> 00:35:44,257
<b>Goodness.</b>

419
00:35:44,727 --> 00:35:48,127
<b>Hey. Do you have a house in Wokin-dong?</b>

420
00:35:49,096 --> 00:35:50,127
<b>Yes.</b>

421
00:35:50,996 --> 00:35:52,667
<b>So it was your house.</b>

422
00:35:55,667 --> 00:35:57,107
<b>- Why? - Nothing.</b>

423
00:35:57,107 --> 00:35:59,737
<b>I may ask for a favor next time if I need something.</b>

424
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:03,507
<b>(Mr. Kang)</b>

425
00:36:04,647 --> 00:36:07,016
<b>Uncle, I have a call. Bye.</b>

00:36:11,647 --> 00:36:13,386
<b>At the studio tomorrow evening.</b>

<b>Seo Woo.</b>

428

<b>Mr. Kang says he wants to use the studio. Do you have time?</b>

429
00:36:23,366 --> 00:36:26,366
<b>I have an evening performance, so I'm free in the afternoon.</b>

430
00:36:26,366 --> 00:36:27,897
<b>I'll go right now.</b>

431
00:36:27,897 --> 00:36:29,167
<b>Thanks.</b>

432
00:36:29,766 --> 00:36:31,036
<b>Did you tell him...</b>

433
00:36:32,167 --> 00:36:33,636
<b>about the letter?</b>

434
00:36:34,107 --> 00:36:37,676
<b>Not yet. But I should when the timing is right.</b>

435
00:36:37,906 --> 00:36:39,246
<b>Don't do it.</b>

436
00:36:39,277 --> 00:36:42,076
<b>I'm sure it'll be hard for my uncle when he finds out,</b>

437
00:36:42,076 --> 00:36:44,147
<b>but he'll find out what he needs to,</b>

438
00:36:44,147 --> 00:36:47,457
<b>destroy Ji Soo's husband, and move on right away.</b>

439
00:36:47,556 --> 00:36:49,257
<b>He's tougher than you think.</b>

440
00:36:49,257 --> 00:36:51,627
<b>Seo Woo. Don't worry.</b>

441
00:37:02,096 --> 00:37:03,806
<b>It looks okay.</b>

442
00:37:06,076 --> 00:37:09,446
<b>You brought the mattress, so you can take it with you.</b>

443

<b>There's a fee to throw it away.</b>

444
00:37:12,047 --> 00:37:13,277
<b>And...</b>

445
00:37:13,616 --> 00:37:14,746
<b>I'll take it with me.</b>

446
00:37:16,246 --> 00:37:19,487
<b>I'll call a moving truck and two men to come tomorrow.</b>

447
00:37:20,917 --> 00:37:22,556
<b>You should go to work.</b>

448
00:37:32,627 --> 00:37:34,696
<b>What if I leave and...</b>

449
00:37:35,567 --> 00:37:38,366
<b>- What if... - I don't want what-ifs.</b>

450
00:37:38,366 --> 00:37:40,536
<b>I'm not interested in events that may or may not occur.</b>

451

<b>I have too much to do right now.</b>

452

<b>Are you bored?</b>

453
00:37:44,147 --> 00:37:46,716
<b>Then you can call the movers yourself.</b>

454
00:37:47,147 --> 00:37:49,687
<b>You're so cool about this. Good for you.</b>

455
00:38:05,127 --> 00:38:06,167
<b>What are you looking at?</b>

456
00:38:06,167 --> 00:38:09,766
<b>What? Min Jung's posts.</b>

457
00:38:10,266 --> 00:38:13,076
<b>They're all pictures of food. Take a look.</b>

459

<b>You've been eating well and living it up.</b>

<b>I'm jealous. Look at this.</b>

461

<b>They're from places...</b>

462

<b>that my daughter looked up and told me to go to.</b>

463

<b>She was always in the hospital,</b>

464
00:38:33,156 --> 00:38:35,757
<b>so she loved it when I ate good food.</b>

465
00:38:36,127 --> 00:38:38,797
<b>I'd go and take a picture of myself enjoying the food,</b>

466
00:38:39,466 --> 00:38:41,136
<b>and my daughter would post comments.</b>

467
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:45,567
<b>She'd like them and...</b>

468
00:38:46,007 --> 00:38:49,176
<b>she'd be happier if others liked them too.</b>

469

<b>(It looks so good! Eat up and have a good day at work!)</b>

470
00:38:54,877 --> 00:38:57,446
<b>I want to go here too. Take me.</b>

471
00:38:57,446 --> 00:38:58,516
<b>So...</b>

472
00:38:59,446 --> 00:39:01,516
<b>I want to eat things like this too.</b>

00:52:22,851 --> 00:52:23,851
<b>Radishes?</b>

633
00:52:24,251 --> 00:52:26,322
<b>What's wrong with my mom?</b>

634
00:52:30,762 --> 00:52:34,431
<b>It's sweet. Radishes aren't usually sweet in the spring.</b>

635
00:52:36,061 --> 00:52:37,362
<b>It's delicious.</b>

636
00:52:38,701 --> 00:52:39,731
<b>What?</b>

637
00:52:40,771 --> 00:52:41,831
<b>Okay.</b>

638
00:52:50,311 --> 00:52:52,282
<b>What? Do you regret it?</b>

639
00:52:53,782 --> 00:52:57,422
<b>I feel like I messed up. Should I beg?</b>

640
00:52:58,052 --> 00:53:01,751
<b>Eun Joo is a great girl. Why did I...</b>

641
00:53:02,251 --> 00:53:04,391
<b>She's so nice.</b>

642
00:53:05,422 --> 00:53:06,962
<b>Should I get on my knees?</b>

643
00:53:06,962 --> 00:53:09,632
<b>Chang Sup. Heed my words.</b>

644
00:53:10,902 --> 00:53:12,431
<b>It's too late.</b>

645
00:53:24,041 --> 00:53:25,382
<b>Get to work.</b>

646
00:53:26,541 --> 00:53:27,851
<b>What will you do?</b>

647
00:53:27,851 --> 00:53:30,822
<b>What else? I'll have to prepare what I have been.</b>

648
00:53:32,481 --> 00:53:34,851
<b>Ji Soo didn't tell him, so he shouldn't know.</b>

649
00:53:34,851 --> 00:53:35,851
<b>Those were your words.</b>

650
00:53:35,851 --> 00:53:38,722
<b>We shouldn't waste the effort Ji Soo put into it.</b>

651
00:53:38,891 --> 00:53:41,692
<b>That was when we didn't know who Kang In Wook was.</b>

652
00:53:41,692 --> 00:53:43,701
<b>More the reason since we do know.</b>

653
00:53:44,902 --> 00:53:46,731
<b>You want to keep up the charade?</b>

654
00:53:46,731 --> 00:53:48,701
<b>Regardless of who Kang In Wook is?</b>

655
00:53:48,972 --> 00:53:51,141
<b>Exactly.</b>

656
00:53:51,141 --> 00:53:53,001
<b>Why did you come here?</b>

657
00:53:55,742 --> 00:53:57,382
<b>Keep your personal life out of your work.</b>

658
00:53:58,242 --> 00:53:59,882
<b>Keep preparing what you've been working on.</b>

659
00:53:59,882 --> 00:54:01,981
<b>Don't let these little things distract you.</b>

660
00:54:03,251 --> 00:54:04,451
<b>Then...</b>

661
00:54:05,322 --> 00:54:08,052
<b>tell your uncle everything you know.</b>

662
00:54:08,052 --> 00:54:11,762
<b>And let your uncle take care of everything. And...</b>

663
00:54:12,222 --> 00:54:14,731
<b>if you still want to do what we've been preparing,</b>

664
00:54:15,161 --> 00:54:16,231
<b>go ahead.</b>

665
00:54:16,692 --> 00:54:17,902
<b>You two can do it.</b>

666
00:54:18,802 --> 00:54:20,231
<b>You stay out of it.</b>

667
00:54:20,632 --> 00:54:22,472
<b>I'll keep doing what I have been.</b>

668
00:54:26,172 --> 00:54:27,771
<b>I know better than you do...</b>

669
00:54:28,072 --> 00:54:31,342
<b>just how sickening this situation is.</b>

670
00:54:31,612 --> 00:54:34,052
<b>Please. For the next few days,</b>

671
00:54:34,351 --> 00:54:35,951
<b>just do what I tell you.</b>

672
00:54:35,951 --> 00:54:38,282
<b>I'll tell him everything once this recital is over,</b>

673
00:54:38,951 --> 00:54:40,251
<b>so please.</b>

674
00:54:40,951 --> 00:54:42,922
<b>Let's not tell my uncle for a few days.</b>

675
00:54:44,862 --> 00:54:46,121
<b>Please do that for me.</b>

676
00:54:51,262 --> 00:54:53,501
<b>I do have the time, but...</b>

677
00:54:53,871 --> 00:54:57,342
<b>Ms. Moon put in an enormous amount of work, so please.</b>

678
00:54:57,342 --> 00:55:00,512
<b>It would be good for you to do the recital by yourself.</b>

679
00:55:00,771 --> 00:55:02,141
<b>I know.</b>

680
00:55:03,242 --> 00:55:04,681
<b>Why don't you want to do it?</b>

681
00:55:05,742 --> 00:55:07,751
<b>Because Mr. Kang is despicable.</b>

682
00:55:07,981 --> 00:55:11,722
<b>He's despicable. I'm furious. I'm going crazy.</b>

683
00:55:11,782 --> 00:55:14,152
<b>I'm losing my mind and am dumbfounded. That's why.</b>

684
00:55:15,322 --> 00:55:18,891
<b>How could you call me despicable to my face? What else was there?</b>

685
00:55:18,891 --> 00:55:20,831
<b>You're going crazy.</b>

686
00:55:43,512 --> 00:55:45,422
<b>He's back to playing classical music.</b>

687
00:55:45,422 --> 00:55:47,791
<b>He's back to his old self.</b>

688
00:55:50,052 --> 00:55:51,462
<b>Back to his old self.</b>

689
00:55:51,992 --> 00:55:54,291
<b>You can do the recital, right?</b>

690
00:55:54,532 --> 00:55:57,431
<b>I think it's only right that you do it.</b>

691
00:55:57,762 --> 00:56:00,972
<b>You understand Mr. Kang as he is now.</b>

692
00:56:02,371 --> 00:56:04,201
<b>I may ruin it.</b>

693
00:56:06,001 --> 00:56:07,112
<b>No.</b>

694
00:56:07,911 --> 00:56:09,771
<b>Should I ruin it?</b>

695
00:56:10,612 --> 00:56:11,842
<b>I'll do it.</b>

696
00:56:13,782 --> 00:56:15,612
<b>Why did your friend go to that house?</b>

697
00:56:18,451 --> 00:56:20,121
<b>That house with good acoustics.</b>

698
00:56:20,992 --> 00:56:22,791
<b>I almost went,</b>

699
00:56:23,451 --> 00:56:24,561
<b>but couldn't.</b>

700
00:56:26,061 --> 00:56:28,891
<b>Okay. I see.</b>

701
00:56:28,891 --> 00:56:32,001
<b>You said your friend went inside.</b>

702
00:56:32,362 --> 00:56:33,871
<b>I corrected my statement...</b>

703
00:56:34,472 --> 00:56:37,302
<b>and said my friend never went into that house.</b>

704
00:56:38,601 --> 00:56:40,472
<b>You clearly said she had been there.</b>

705
00:56:43,782 --> 00:56:46,481
<b>How can she check the sound without going inside?</b>

706
00:56:48,581 --> 00:56:52,251
<b>Ji Soo never went into that house.</b>

707
00:56:59,573 --> 00:57:03,243
<b>Ji Soo never went into that house.</b>

708
00:57:08,812 --> 00:57:11,652
<b>That's my friend's name. Kim Ji Soo.</b>

709
00:57:12,252 --> 00:57:13,823
<b>She's older than I am.</b>

710
00:58:26,192 --> 00:58:27,493
<b>- What are you doing? - What are you doing?</b>

711
00:58:33,973 --> 00:58:35,973
<b>Let's not tell my uncle for a few days.</b>

712
00:58:36,502 --> 00:58:37,902
<b>Well...</b>

713
00:58:39,643 --> 00:58:41,843
<b>It's really nice out.</b>

714
00:58:41,913 --> 00:58:45,042
<b>Did you know? You really need to know.</b>

715
00:58:56,252 --> 00:58:58,062
<b>It really is nice.</b>

716
00:58:58,922 --> 00:59:00,962
<b>I almost missed it.</b>

717
00:59:02,292 --> 00:59:04,102
<b>You actually played along.</b>

718
00:59:04,363 --> 00:59:05,462
<b>How nice.</b>

719
00:59:10,332 --> 00:59:12,942
<b>I need some powerful healing.</b>

720
00:59:13,372 --> 00:59:15,772
<b>Can we do a half-look?</b>

721
00:59:17,783 --> 00:59:18,942
<b>Where are you?</b>

722
00:59:43,973 --> 00:59:46,643
<b>Briefly and affectionately.</b>

723
00:59:54,883 --> 00:59:56,482
<b>I guess this is why.</b>

724
00:59:57,152 --> 01:00:02,053
<b>I feel like I am very strong lately.</b>

725
01:00:03,493 --> 01:00:06,663
<b>It must be because someone is staying with me...</b>

726
01:00:07,093 --> 01:00:08,993
<b>and I feel safe.</b>

727
01:00:08,993 --> 01:00:10,232
<b>I'm glad.</b>

728
01:00:11,863 --> 01:00:13,562
<b>See you tomorrow night.</b>

729
01:00:14,772 --> 01:00:16,303
<b>I'll be done by then.</b>

730
01:00:17,272 --> 01:00:20,473
<b>I'll stay with you non-stop starting tomorrow night.</b>

731
01:00:23,643 --> 01:00:26,683
<b>I'm charged 70 percent.</b>

732
01:00:32,652 --> 01:00:34,352
<b>85 percent.</b>

733
01:00:37,292 --> 01:00:38,763
<b>100 percent.</b>

734
01:00:46,062 --> 01:00:49,172
<b>There will be two recitals. At 4pm and 7pm.</b>

735
01:00:49,872 --> 01:00:53,073
<b>Ticket sales for 4pm recitals are usually very low.</b>

736
01:00:53,143 --> 01:00:56,772
<b>The 7pm recital is the real one. The 4pm one is more like a warm-up.</b>

737
01:00:57,683 --> 01:00:59,883
<b>Okay. Where's the video for the preview?</b>

738
01:00:59,883 --> 01:01:01,053
<b>I didn't get it yet.</b>

739
01:01:01,053 --> 01:01:02,582
<b>I sent it.</b>

740
01:01:02,582 --> 01:01:05,823
<b>We can use the old one. That looks nice.</b>

741
01:01:05,823 --> 01:01:07,053
<b>What was that?</b>

742
01:01:10,192 --> 01:01:11,493
<b>Is this it?</b>

743
01:01:12,192 --> 01:01:14,493
<b>Yes, that's it.</b>

744
01:01:26,073 --> 01:01:28,573
<b>My wife has never been to a recital like this.</b>

745
01:01:28,573 --> 01:01:30,473
<b>The page-turner must be his wife.</b>

746
01:01:31,542 --> 01:01:33,343
<b>Do you want me to upload this too?</b>

747
01:01:33,643 --> 01:01:35,383
<b>No, just the front part.</b>

748
01:01:35,812 --> 01:01:37,183
<b>The part where Ji Soo can't be seen.</b>

749
01:01:37,323 --> 01:01:38,652
<b>Who's Ji Soo?</b>

750
01:01:39,252 --> 01:01:40,922
<b>The woman next to him.</b>

751
01:01:44,922 --> 01:01:46,192
<b>Did Uncle...</b>

752
01:01:47,192 --> 01:01:48,332
<b>see this?</b>

753
01:01:52,732 --> 01:01:54,172
<b>Did you meet Kang In Wook?</b>

754
01:01:57,502 --> 01:01:58,772
<b>Soon Ho...</b>

755
01:01:59,902 --> 01:02:02,843
<b>didn't tell you there was another letter from Ji Soo, did she?</b>

756
01:02:04,113 --> 01:02:06,883
<b>I read it and gave it to her.</b>

757
01:02:06,883 --> 01:02:10,312
<b>She seemed to struggle about whether or not to show it to you.</b>

758
01:02:11,122 --> 01:02:12,482
<b>There was a connection...</b>

759
01:02:13,352 --> 01:02:16,593
<b>between Ji Soo's husband and your mom.</b>

760
01:02:20,993 --> 01:02:22,533
<b>Go to Kang In Wook.</b>

761
01:02:24,502 --> 01:02:25,663
<b>Go and ask him.</b>

762
01:02:41,413 --> 01:02:45,652
<b>Rehearse in Mr. Choi's studio today instead of ours.</b>

763
01:02:46,453 --> 01:02:47,792
<b>Something came up.</b>

764
01:02:48,252 --> 01:02:49,993
<b>Do not come to the studio.</b>

765
01:02:49,993 --> 01:02:51,422
<b>(Do not come to the studio.)</b>

766
01:02:59,533 --> 01:03:00,562
<b>Hey.</b>

767
01:03:03,533 --> 01:03:05,502
<b>I guess Kang In Wook will be here to rehearse tonight.</b>

768
01:03:06,973 --> 01:03:08,113
<b>He canceled.</b>

769
01:03:16,852 --> 01:03:18,352
<b>Why didn't you come to the house?</b>

770
01:03:19,783 --> 01:03:21,223
<b>Something came up while I was going.</b>

771
01:03:27,022 --> 01:03:28,533
<b>You did it on purpose.</b>

772
01:03:29,292 --> 01:03:30,562
<b>Did you tell me to come on purpose?</b>

773
01:03:32,163 --> 01:03:33,402
<b>Because of Kang In Wook?</b>

774
01:03:34,832 --> 01:03:37,203
<b>- Why? - He's Ji Soo's husband.</b>

775
01:03:40,672 --> 01:03:43,312
<b>You weren't interested at all in her husband.</b>

776
01:03:43,312 --> 01:03:44,482
<b>I only need a minute.</b>

777
01:03:45,513 --> 01:03:46,913
<b>Tell me when he's coming here.</b>

778
01:03:47,312 --> 01:03:48,783
<b>I can explain.</b>

779
01:03:49,453 --> 01:03:50,823
<b>I don't want to hear anything from you.</b>

780
01:03:50,883 --> 01:03:52,522
<b>I don't know what you found out,</b>

781
01:03:52,522 --> 01:03:53,922
<b>- but that's not all of it. - Enough.</b>

782
01:03:56,252 --> 01:03:57,723
<b>Call me when he comes here.</b>

783
01:04:00,163 --> 01:04:01,232
<b>He won't come.</b>

784
01:04:15,973 --> 01:04:17,113
<b>Ji Soo's letter.</b>

785
01:04:17,982 --> 01:04:20,183
<b>I don't have it. I ripped it up.</b>

786
01:04:22,683 --> 01:04:24,482
<b>- Soon Ho. - What?</b>

787
01:04:25,082 --> 01:04:26,323
<b>Do you want an apology?</b>

788
01:04:26,453 --> 01:04:28,022
<b>I don't want a stupid apology.</b>

<b>Do you...</b>

790

<b>- not know why I'm being like this? - I do. I do, but...</b>

<b>Soon Ho, I need...</b>

<b>to know exactly what happened that day.</b>

794
01:04:44,542 --> 01:04:47,913
<b>Whether I lost everything simply and nonsensically because of a blizzard.</b>

795

<b>It's driving me crazy.</b>

<b>Did something happen?</b>

797

<b>Once I find out the truth,</b>

798
01:04:59,183 --> 01:05:00,993
<b>I'll never see that jerk again.</b>

799
01:05:02,453 --> 01:05:05,692
<b>Apologies? Resentment? All of that is meaningless.</b>

800

<b>He won't come today.</b>

801

<b>Was Mr. Kang here?</b>

<b>Seriously. I'm sick and tired of love,</b>

<b>I locked myself in the farm for nine years.</b>

<b>I was holed up there...</b>

<b>even if I roam around near him,</b>

817

<b>I won't run into that jerk that I avoided for nine years.</b>

<b>So why...</b>

<b>I'm going crazy too.</b>

821
