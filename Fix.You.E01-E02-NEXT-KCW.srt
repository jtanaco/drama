<b>He came to the ER at dawn.</b>

3
00:00:45,387 --> 00:00:46,986
<b>Hey, does it hurt a lot?</b>

4
00:00:48,927 --> 00:00:50,457
<b>I asked for an orthopedist.</b>

5
00:00:50,457 --> 00:00:51,957
<b>Why is it you again?</b>

6
00:00:51,957 --> 00:00:54,027
<b>Why do you suddenly want
a different doctor?</b>

7
00:00:57,436 --> 00:00:58,667
<b>It hurts even when I just touch you?</b>

8
00:00:59,906 --> 00:01:02,376
<b>I'll give you some analgesics.</b>

9
00:01:15,447 --> 00:01:16,816
<b>Have you been using crutches?</b>

10
00:01:16,816 --> 00:01:19,357
<b>I can't even walk due to the pain,
so I have to use them.</b>

11
00:01:21,286 --> 00:01:23,327
<b>Just get me an orthopedist.</b>

12
00:01:24,257 --> 00:01:26,667
<b>Why do you keep
asking for an orthopedist?</b>

13
00:01:27,527 --> 00:01:29,167
<b>I want my leg amputated.</b>

14
00:01:29,697 --> 00:01:30,697
<b>What?</b>

15
00:01:31,796 --> 00:01:33,736
<b>I can't play soccer with this leg.</b>

16
00:01:34,167 --> 00:01:35,807
<b>I'm always walking with a limp
because it hurts.</b>

17
00:01:36,206 --> 00:01:37,577
<b>So I'd rather
just have it amputated.</b>

18
00:01:37,577 --> 00:01:38,906
<b>How are you going to play soccer...</b>

19
00:01:38,906 --> 00:01:40,876
<b>with an amputated leg?
Are you going to give up?</b>

20
00:01:40,876 --> 00:01:43,277
<b>I'm not giving up. I just can't play
because of the pain.</b>

21
00:01:43,376 --> 00:01:45,176
<b>How am I supposed to play soccer
with this leg?</b>

22
00:01:48,986 --> 00:01:50,057
<b>You're right.</b>

23
00:01:50,486 --> 00:01:52,727
<b>There's no point in playing soccer
when you're not well.</b>

24
00:01:53,557 --> 00:01:54,626
<b>Call orthopedics.</b>

25
00:01:54,626 --> 00:01:57,126
<b>I already did, but he needs to wait
at least a month.</b>

26
00:01:58,557 --> 00:01:59,667
<b>What should we do?</b>

27
00:02:05,066 --> 00:02:06,236
<b>I guess there's no other choice.</b>

28
00:02:08,337 --> 00:02:09,536
<b>I'll amputate it for you.</b>

29
00:02:13,977 --> 00:02:15,146
<b>You... You're going to do it?</b>

30
00:02:16,917 --> 00:02:18,847
<b>How can a psychiatrist
perform surgery?</b>

31
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:20,646
<b>Why can't I?
I even fix people's minds.</b>

32
00:02:20,646 --> 00:02:21,986
<b>Amputating a leg is easy.</b>

33
00:02:22,216 --> 00:02:25,086
<b>I think you made the right choice.
Let's just get rid of this leg.</b>

34
00:02:25,086 --> 00:02:27,227
<b>You're always sick,
and you can't even play soccer.</b>

35
00:02:27,227 --> 00:02:28,687
<b>So what's the point
of having this leg?</b>

36
00:02:28,687 --> 00:02:30,697
<b>I'll make sure
to cut it nice and clean.</b>

37
00:02:31,097 --> 00:02:32,667
<b>These days, artificial legs
are very nicely made.</b>

38
00:02:32,667 --> 00:02:34,167
<b>So you won't even need crutches.</b>

39
00:02:34,926 --> 00:02:36,437
<b>Let's get ready for surgery.</b>

40
00:02:36,437 --> 00:02:37,466
<b>- Okay.
- Let's go.</b>

<b>What... What are you doing?</b>

44
00:02:46,877 --> 00:02:48,507
<b>We need you to stay still.</b>

45

<b>- Please wait just a little bit.
- No, wait.</b>

<b>Just a second.</b>

<b>No! No!</b>

49

<b>No! No! Don't!</b>

50

<b>Did you really think I'd do it here?</b>

51
00:03:32,657 --> 00:03:34,127
<b>Take him to the OR.</b>

<b>- Let's go.
- You're really going to cut it off?</b>

<b>Doctor, I don't think this is right.</b>

<b>- Let me leave.

311
00:19:48,797 --> 00:19:50,336
<b>The dermatology specialist...</b>

312
00:19:50,336 --> 00:19:52,336
<b>decided it's not simple dermatitis,</b>

313
00:19:52,336 --> 00:19:54,336
<b>and suggested
she see a psychiatrist.</b>

314
00:19:54,336 --> 00:19:56,336
<b>The patient vehemently refused,</b>

315
00:19:56,507 --> 00:19:58,537
<b>only to return three months later.</b>

316
00:19:58,537 --> 00:20:00,676
<b>Dermatology asked us for a consult.</b>

317
00:20:01,176 --> 00:20:02,747
<b>It's most likely...</b>

318
00:20:02,906 --> 00:20:05,616
<b>a physical delusional disorder
that involves parasites.</b>

319
00:20:05,777 --> 00:20:08,146
<b>From the photos,
I'd say she sprayed something.</b>

320
00:20:08,146 --> 00:20:10,686
<b>Yes. Disinfectants, insecticides,</b>

321
00:20:10,686 --> 00:20:13,156
<b>herbicides, anything that'll
kill bugs, she sprayed.</b>

322
00:20:13,686 --> 00:20:16,086
<b>Shouldn't we suspect
poisoning due to insecticides too?</b>

323
00:20:16,086 --> 00:20:18,356
<b>Good point. She coughs
and has difficulty breathing.</b>

324
00:20:18,356 --> 00:20:21,467
<b>How do you think we should
proceed with treating her?</b>

325
00:20:23,896 --> 00:20:27,037
<b>First, we must calm her
with medicine.</b>

326
00:20:27,336 --> 00:20:28,906
<b>Most physical
delusional disorders...</b>

327
00:20:28,906 --> 00:20:30,807
<b>are accompanied by anxiety issues.</b>

328
00:20:30,807 --> 00:20:33,846
<b>A benzodiazepine
anti-anxiety drug should suffice.</b>

329
00:20:34,876 --> 00:20:36,146
<b>With delusional disorders,</b>

330
00:20:36,146 --> 00:20:38,846
<b>I believe an anti-psychotic
is the treatment of choice.</b>

331
00:20:38,846 --> 00:20:39,916
<b>But...</b>

332
00:20:40,247 --> 00:20:44,057
<b>if you start by medicating
a patient without any rapport,</b>

333
00:20:44,057 --> 00:20:46,217
<b>do you think the medicine will help?</b>

334
00:20:47,327 --> 00:20:51,027
<b>Which is why I think we should
start with psychological counseling.</b>

335
00:20:52,696 --> 00:20:56,297
<b>The patient's vehemently
refusing psychiatric help,</b>

336
00:20:56,666 --> 00:20:57,797
<b>so how will you do that?</b>

337
00:20:58,396 --> 00:21:00,366
<b>Why not speak with her family?</b>

338
00:21:00,866 --> 00:21:02,406
<b>Will the patient wait?</b>

339
00:21:02,406 --> 00:21:03,707
<b>I have a feeling...</b>

340
00:21:03,707 --> 00:21:06,336
<b>she'll scratch off her skin
before we manage that.</b>

341
00:21:08,277 --> 00:21:11,446
<b>I think going out as a team
is the only option.</b>

342
00:21:11,777 --> 00:21:13,747
<b>To find out what happened to her.</b>

343
00:21:15,586 --> 00:21:16,787
<b>Why are you sitting there?</b>

344
00:21:20,957 --> 00:21:22,057
<b>I'll get going now.</b>

345
00:21:26,096 --> 00:21:27,827
<b>- Good luck.
- Thanks.</b>

346
00:21:34,537 --> 00:21:36,936
<b>We might get her to talk first.</b>

347
00:21:38,207 --> 00:21:39,477
<b>That's your method.</b>

348
00:21:40,606 --> 00:21:42,846
<b>I'll deal with my patients
my own way.</b>

349
00:21:43,717 --> 00:21:44,747
<b>See you.</b>

350
00:21:51,057 --> 00:21:53,926
<b>Why must I see a psychiatrist
for a skin problem?</b>

351
00:21:54,027 --> 00:21:57,227
<b>Are you saying there's
something wrong with my mind?</b>

352
00:21:57,856 --> 00:22:01,126
<b>I'm just checking if there are
any psychological issues.</b>

353
00:22:01,126 --> 00:22:03,596
<b>You don't have to take it
too seriously.</b>

354
00:22:04,037 --> 00:22:06,237
<b>I'll ask a few simple questions,</b>

355
00:22:06,567 --> 00:22:09,606
<b>then have you admitted
to treat your skin.</b>

356
00:22:14,047 --> 00:22:17,217
<b>You said that insects
keep burrowing out of your arm?</b>

357
00:22:17,217 --> 00:22:18,217
<b>Yes.</b>

358
00:22:18,676 --> 00:22:21,616
<b>But the dermatologist
won't believe me.</b>

359
00:22:22,386 --> 00:22:23,886
<b>When did this start?</b>

360
00:22:26,517 --> 00:22:27,926
<b>A little under three months ago.</b>

361
00:22:28,586 --> 00:22:33,297
<b>Did something happen to shock
or upset you around that time?</b>

362
00:22:33,497 --> 00:22:34,596
<b>Listen.</b>

363
00:22:35,067 --> 00:22:38,836
<b>Do you want to say that
stress caused this?</b>

364
00:22:39,737 --> 00:22:40,866
<b>Not really.</b>

365
00:22:42,807 --> 00:22:43,876
<b>You're so annoying.</b>

366
00:23:01,656 --> 00:23:03,727
<b>What are you doing?</b>

367
00:23:03,727 --> 00:23:04,926
<b>I'm done. Just a moment.</b>

368
00:23:07,567 --> 00:23:10,297
<b>Ms. Kim. Look at this photo.</b>

369
00:23:12,936 --> 00:23:14,606
<b>The photo doesn't show any insects.</b>

370

<b>It seems like you're the only one
who can see the insects.</b>

371
00:23:20,136 --> 00:23:21,846
<b>So why don't we try to figure out...</b>

372
00:23:22,507 --> 00:23:23,916
<b>why this is happening?</b>

373
00:23:25,416 --> 00:23:28,846
<b>You're calling me crazy, aren't you?</b>

374

- Don't lie to me.</b>

<b>Remember Kim Yu Ra that got
sent here from Dermatology?</b>

376
00:23:48,136 --> 00:23:49,606
<b>Have her hospitalized right now.</b>

377
00:23:49,707 --> 00:23:50,836
<b>Okay.</b>

378
00:23:51,836 --> 00:23:53,946
<b>Do you want her hospitalized
at the psychiatric ward?</b>

379
00:23:53,946 --> 00:23:55,646
<b>No, she's showing
a lot of resistance.</b>

380
00:23:55,646 --> 00:23:56,777
<b>So send her to the general ward.</b>

00:28:28,886 --> 00:28:31,557
<b>But thanks to a certain cop,
he was able to avoid getting sent...</b>

464
00:28:31,557 --> 00:28:33,457
<b>to a youth detention center.</b>

465
00:28:34,827 --> 00:28:38,696
<b>Ever since then,
he dreamed of becoming a cop.</b>

466
00:28:39,896 --> 00:28:42,227
<b>But he kept failing the test...</b>

467
00:28:42,227 --> 00:28:44,836
<b>because he had to work part-time
as he studied for the test.</b>

468
00:28:46,096 --> 00:28:47,196
<b>And in the end,</b>

<b>his grandmother passed away...</b>

470
00:28:49,267 --> 00:28:52,136
<b>without being able to see

471

<b>She died due to a DUI car accident.</b>

472

<b>On the day of her funeral,</b>

473
00:29:01,586 --> 00:29:03,787
<b>he stole a cop's uniform
and wore it...</b>

474
00:29:04,457 --> 00:29:06,817
<b>so he could make
his grandmother's dream come true.</b>

475
00:29:08,356 --> 00:29:11,757
<b>But he kept wearing the uniform
even after the funeral,</b>

476
00:29:12,327 --> 00:29:14,426
<b>and it made him feel like
a real cop.</b>

477
00:29:16,696 --> 00:29:20,267
<b>And ever since then, he actually
started to think of himself as one.</b>

478

482

<b>But you know you're not a cop.</b>

483
00:30:09,146 --> 00:30:11,386
<b>Why do you keep telling me
that I'm not a cop?</b>

484
00:30:16,787 --> 00:30:18,926
<b>I need to patrol the neighborhood.
Let me out of here right now.</b>

00:48:55,935 --> 00:48:56,935
<b>I apologize.</b>

773

<b>Who are you?</b>

776
00:49:07,906 --> 00:49:08,975

- It's not right...</b>

779

780

<b>I'm very sorry.</b>

783

<b>If you take this to the police,</b>

784
00:49:28,066 --> 00:49:30,795

00:50:18,316 --> 00:50:19,616
<b>He's not an officer.</b>

798

<b>What is he then?</b>

799
00:50:23,116 --> 00:50:24,215
<b>Who are you?</b>

800

<b>I'm sorry.</b>

802
00:50:34,826 --> 00:50:35,866

807

<b>he isn't a policeman.</b>

809

<b>Then what is he?</b>

810
00:50:58,156 --> 00:50:59,886

811

<b>How will you explain this?</b>

818
00:51:26,616 --> 00:51:29,215
<b>- Isn't this a scandal?

<b>How do you feel right now?</b>

820
00:51:30,556 --> 00:51:32,455

<b>Don't worry.</b>

<b>A fake cop

<b>What?</b>

888
00:54:48,586 --> 00:54:50,086
<b>This is the real thing.</b>

<b>It's broken.</b>

890
00:54:57,926 --> 00:54:58,955
<b>It's broken?</b>

891
00:54:59,056 --> 00:55:00,765
<b>- Blow into this.
- Okay.</b>

892
00:55:05,096 --> 00:55:06,265
<b>It's broken.</b>

893
00:55:06,265 --> 00:55:08,066
<b>It says 0.08 percent all the time.</b>

894
00:55:08,535 --> 00:55:09,676
<b>Then...</b>

895
00:55:11,275 --> 00:55:14,045
<b>this happened to me

896
00:55:14,376 --> 00:55:16,876
<b>shoved a broken machine in my face?</b>

<b>Just a moment.</b>

898
00:55:38,235 --> 00:55:39,235
<b>Hey.</b>

899
00:55:39,666 --> 00:55:41,566
<b>I just took another test...</b>

900

<b>Can you write about it?</b>

902
00:55:45,306 --> 00:55:46,906
<b>I didn't drive drunk...</b>

<b>No, wait.</b>

905
00:55:51,616 --> 00:55:53,886
<b>How about you interview me?</b>

906
00:55:53,916 --> 00:55:55,086
<b>Okay.</b>

907
00:55:55,416 --> 00:55:57,886
<b>I'm going into a meeting.

<b>This was just an accident.</b>

909
00:56:10,965 --> 00:56:12,195
<b>Like a car accident.</b>

910
00:56:14,535 --> 00:56:15,965
<b>I couldn't have done anything,</b>

<b>so I can make things right.</b>

912

<b>The sobriety test was wrong...</b>

913
00:56:21,576 --> 00:56:23,676
<b>and the fake cop

<b>Did you really drive drunk?</b>

919
00:57:04,556 --> 00:57:06,386

921

930
00:58:22,826 --> 00:58:23,965
<b>Are you two-timing me?</b>

931
00:58:23,965 --> 00:58:26,066
<b>How could someone like me do that?</b>

932
00:58:26,136 --> 00:58:27,435
<b>She's a friend.</b>

933
00:58:27,435 --> 00:58:29,265
<b>- Did you like it?
- As if.</b>

934
00:58:29,265 --> 00:58:31,475
<b>- She's just a friend.
- Not that.</b>

935
00:58:32,306 --> 00:58:34,705
<b>Getting an exclusive scoop.</b>

936
00:58:35,176 --> 00:58:37,416
<b>Did you like it, you scumbag?</b>

937
00:58:38,475 --> 00:58:39,916
<b>You jerk.</b>

938
00:58:41,515 --> 00:58:43,116
<b>I had no choice.</b>

939
00:58:43,316 --> 00:58:44,856
<b>My superior saw it first and...</b>

940
00:58:56,896 --> 00:58:58,566
<b>Hey. Hey!</b>

941
00:59:00,765 --> 00:59:01,906
<b>What are you...</b>

942
00:59:02,005 --> 00:59:03,136
<b>Han Woo Joo!</b>

943
00:59:20,755 --> 00:59:24,126
<b>Everyone creates a basement
in their heart.</b>

944
00:59:24,896 --> 00:59:27,725
<b>And in that basement,
they hide their secrets.</b>

945
00:59:29,795 --> 00:59:32,235
<b>Things that other people don't know.</b>

946
00:59:34,765 --> 00:59:37,975
<b>What are you hiding
in your basement?</b>

947
01:01:04,295 --> 01:01:05,426
<b>(Special thanks to Wi Ha Joon.)</b>

948
01:01:07,195 --> 01:01:09,995
<b>(Fix You)</b>

949
01:01:11,396 --> 01:01:12,896
<b>Must I abandon my patient?</b>

950
01:01:12,896 --> 01:01:14,005
<b>Are you the only doctor?</b>

951
01:01:14,106 --> 01:01:15,866
<b>Actors are all about the image.</b>

952
01:01:15,866 --> 01:01:17,576
<b>What does the truth matter?</b>

953
01:01:17,576 --> 01:01:18,975
<b>Could you please settle?</b>

954
01:01:18,975 --> 01:01:21,306
<b>Why should I settle?</b>

955
01:01:21,576 --> 01:01:23,316
<b>Why is my life so messed up?</b>

956
01:01:23,745 --> 01:01:26,916
<b>I just want to live like
other people.</b>

957
01:01:27,045 --> 01:01:29,245
<b>Oh? What are you doing here?</b>

958
01:01:29,515 --> 01:01:31,755
<b>Oh Yu Min said he's your fan.</b>

959
01:01:31,755 --> 01:01:33,656
<b>- Did he really?
- Yes!</b>

960
01:01:33,656 --> 01:01:34,785
<b>He did it!</b>

961
01:01:34,785 --> 01:01:36,896
<b>Why do you keep
treating me like a patient?</b>

962
01:01:36,896 --> 01:01:38,795
<b>It feels really messed up!</b>

963
01:01:40,495 --> 01:01:42,995
<b>Woo Joo, get down from there.
It's very dangerous.</b>

964
01:01:43,265 --> 01:01:45,035
<b>I have a patient for you.</b>

965
01:01:45,035 --> 01:01:46,295
<b>You met already.</b>

966
01:01:46,705 --> 01:01:47,735
<b>Darn...</b>

967
01:01:49,005 --> 01:01:51,035
<b>Where did you learn to
swear like that?</b>
