<b>Was it really necessary to come back here?</b>

6
00:00:29,445 --> 00:00:32,115
<b>Checking the scene could give us
a new insight.</b>

7

<b>We can go and check

<b>Why don't you just become a detective?</b>

<b>I'm doing it my way.</b>

11

<b>-that room is...
-Sir.</b>

14

<b>We have a similar suite

<b>That room is very special to us.</b>

<b>Today,</b>

17
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:15,867
<b>I'm going to propose.</b>

18
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:20,329
<b>Well, if that's the case...</b>

19
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:23,416
<b>She's one lucky woman.</b>

20
00:01:23,916 --> 00:01:25,168
<b>Goodness.</b>

21
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:28,546
<b>She was married once.</b>

22
00:01:29,046 --> 00:01:30,298
<b>But for me, it's my first time.</b>

23
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:35,595
<b>There are lots of couples like that
these days. Right?</b>

24
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:38,514
<b>She can be very fussy though.</b>

25
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:40,808
<b>She's fussy and a bit of a clean freak.</b>

26
00:01:41,392 --> 00:01:42,852
<b>She's a little bit of both.</b>

27
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:45,646
<b>So I'm worried about

<b>Hee-jae, come here and push me.</b>

32
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,585
<b>I'm Seo Jeong-hwa, and you're the culprit.</b>

33
00:02:50,419 --> 00:02:53,005
<b>These kinds of things
should be done properly.</b>

34

<b>-Hey!
-What?</b>

35
00:03:05,184 --> 00:03:07,353
<b>But do you think that'd be enough</b>

36
00:03:08,312 --> 00:03:10,606
<b>to shatter the glass table?</b>

37
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:11,899
<b>I'm not sure.</b>

38
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:13,526
<b>This time, you're Seo Jeong-hwa.</b>

39
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:24,787
<b>Shouldn't it require
at least this much strength?</b>

40
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:29,208
<b>I guess it wasn't
involuntary manslaughter then.</b>

41
00:03:32,336 --> 00:03:35,256
<b>The culprit who banged
Seo Jeong-hwa's head on the table</b>

42
00:03:35,339 --> 00:03:37,341
<b>surely would've injured his or her hand.</b>

43
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:43,014
<b>But Ha Chan-ho's hands were fine.
They were only covered in blood.</b>

44
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:48,895
<b>Then here's a second question
assuming that Ha Chan-ho is innocent.</b>

45
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,904
<b>The alcohol spilled on the table.</b>

46
00:03:59,488 --> 00:04:04,493
<b>But at the scene of the accident,
there were no signs of alcohol on the rug.</b>

47
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:06,996
<b>That means the rug
came from somewhere else.</b>

48
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:26,515
<b>In order to move a corpse
and a heavy rug covered in blood,</b>

49
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:28,142
<b>there should be at least two guys.</b>

50
00:04:29,393 --> 00:04:31,854
<b>And somewhere nearby...</b>

51
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:36,442
<b>There has to be a place
that has the same rug and table.</b>

52
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:43,699
<b>Look at this stain.</b>

53
00:04:44,533 --> 00:04:46,494
<b>Do you see this or not?</b>

54
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:48,913
<b>I can't see anything.</b>

55
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:53,585
<b>So I'm the only one who can see this?
Oh, my god.</b>

56
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:56,671
<b>Honey, you see this stain, right?</b>

57
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:58,631
<b>It's so dirty.</b>

58
00:05:03,135 --> 00:05:07,723
<b>And look at this place right here.
Look at that and that.</b>

59
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:10,768
<b>I don't like the layout of the furniture.</b>

60
00:05:10,851 --> 00:05:13,270
<b>I personally think</b>

61
00:05:13,354 --> 00:05:14,814
<b>it sucks.</b>

62
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:18,442
<b>Oh, I see.</b>

63
00:05:19,151 --> 00:05:20,820
<b>My goodness gracious.</b>

64
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:23,573
<b>Look at this hair. Oh, my god.</b>

65
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:25,908
<b>What is this hair?
Are you serious right now?</b>

66
00:05:31,288 --> 00:05:33,791
<b>I have very sensitive bronchi.</b>

67
00:05:33,874 --> 00:05:35,418
<b>-Right, honey?
-Right.</b>

68
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:39,672
<b>A single speck of dust
and a strand of hair can be fatal to me.</b>

69
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:42,174
<b>Then what can we do for you?</b>

70
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:44,093
<b>We can give you a refund if you want.</b>

71
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:47,680
<b>There's another suite next door, right?
I'd like to switch to that one.</b>

72
00:05:49,765 --> 00:05:53,352
<b>Ma'am, that suite isn't
for ordinary customers.</b>

73
00:05:53,978 --> 00:05:55,312
<b>It's for one of our VIP customers,</b>

74
00:05:55,396 --> 00:05:57,773
<b>and it's reserved all year long.</b>

75
00:05:59,483 --> 00:06:02,361
<b>SS Group sold all their hotels.</b>

76
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,656
<b>But apparently, Chairman Son still has
exclusive use of one of the suites.</b>

77
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:12,163
<b>What? Can you repeat
why we can't switch rooms?</b>

78
00:06:12,246 --> 00:06:14,957
<b>That suite isn't for ordinary customers.</b>

79

<b>"Ordinary"?</b>

80
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:18,961
<b>Did you just call me ordinary?</b>

81
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:21,965
<b>Oh, my god.</b>

82
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:24,717
<b>Honey, did you hear that?
She called me ordinary.</b>

83

<b>Am I an ordinary person?</b>

84
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:28,262
<b>Did she just label me as someone ordinary?</b>

85
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:30,264
<b>No, that's not what I meant.</b>

<b>You know what? Forget it!
Bring me the president of the hotel.</b>

87

<b>This place has terrible hygiene,</b>

88
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:38,898
<b>but you call this a suite

<b>I'm going to upload a national petition

<b>I'll show you what happens</b>

91

<b>when you mess with an ordinary person.</b>

92

<b>Oh, my god. Me? Ordinary?</b>

93
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,494
<b>You called me ordinary? Really?</b>

94
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:54,038
<b>No one has ever said that to me.
I'm going to tell my mom.</b>

95
00:06:55,414 --> 00:06:57,333
<b>I'll leave as soon as I propose to her.</b>

96
00:06:58,125 --> 00:06:59,960
<b>I went through so much to get this.</b>

97

<b>This diamond was found in 1905

153
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:45,686
<b>You don't have CCTVs? Oh, my god.</b>

154
00:10:45,769 --> 00:10:48,814
<b>Then I'll just have to call the cops.</b>

155
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,399
<b>-Sir.
-Gosh.</b>

156
00:10:50,482 --> 00:10:51,900
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

157
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:54,903
<b>We can't have any more cops
come to our hotel.</b>

158
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:04,330
<b>But there is one thing I can do for you.</b>

159
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:14,923
<b>There aren't any cameras in the room,
but you can check the one in the hallway.</b>

160
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:21,430
<b>There's a CCTV camera in the hallway?</b>

161
00:11:23,515 --> 00:11:28,604
<b>The main concept of our suite
is to protect our guests' privacy.</b>

162
00:11:28,687 --> 00:11:31,398
<b><i>So we keep the hallway CCTV confidential.</i></b>

163
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:36,403
<b>After 24 hours, the footage gets
sent to the security company.</b>

164
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:40,699
<b>But you lost it a few hours ago, so
you'll be able to check the footage here.</b>

165
00:11:47,247 --> 00:11:50,292
<b><i>There aren't any CCTV cameras
in front of the VIP guest room.</i></b>

166
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:53,837
<b>Gosh, that's not good.
We can't see anything.</b>

167
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:56,006
<b>-What?
-Gosh, forget it.</b>

168
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:58,050
<b>How can we find the ring with this?</b>

169
00:11:58,133 --> 00:12:00,761
<b>Where is my ring?
Where is my expensive ring?</b>

170
00:12:00,844 --> 00:12:03,514
<b>You know what?
Call everyone that came into our room.</b>

171
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:07,226
<b>I want my expensive ring back!</b>

172
00:12:07,976 --> 00:12:09,812
<b>-Honey, wait.
-What?</b>

173
00:12:10,145 --> 00:12:13,607
<b>After I gave you the ring, you went
to the bathroom to wash your hands.</b>

174
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:16,276
<b>-Yes.
-Where did you put the ring?</b>

175
00:12:17,736 --> 00:12:18,737
<b>A while ago?</b>

176
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:23,659
<b>I put it in my cute mini bag.</b>

177
00:12:28,872 --> 00:12:30,958
<b>There's your ring.</b>

178
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:33,544
<b>The famous ring you got from Africa.</b>

179
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:36,922
<b>It really does look expensive.</b>

180
00:12:37,714 --> 00:12:40,717
<b>But this whole experience
completely ruined my mood.</b>

181
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:42,219
<b>Let's go somewhere else, honey.</b>

182

<b>About that CCTV camera in the hallway...</b>

183

<b>Do you think the cops didn't know?
It wasn't on the evidence list.</b>

184
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:58,068
<b>We'll find out once we check.
Let's call the security company--</b>

185
00:12:58,152 --> 00:13:00,696
<b>Yes, I already asked Ju-ho to check.</b>

186

<b>What's your relationship with Park Ju-ho?</b>

187

<b>Like us?</b>

189

00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:47,220
<b>Hey, how have you been?</b>

452
00:31:05,383 --> 00:31:07,593
<b>There's a freight container
at the harbor at Yeonan Pier.</b>

453
00:31:13,891 --> 00:31:16,269
<b>Back when we were working
on that case together,</b>

454
00:31:17,186 --> 00:31:21,065
<b>I followed Seo Jeong-hwa's navigation
and went to Yeonan Pier.</b>

455
00:31:22,275 --> 00:31:24,861
<b>That day, I didn't even know
what I should be looking for.</b>

456
00:31:25,445 --> 00:31:26,279
<b>But...</b>

457
00:31:28,698 --> 00:31:31,367
<b>Now, I know. It all makes sense.</b>

458
00:31:44,589 --> 00:31:46,674
<b>My gosh, what is all this?</b>

459
00:31:46,758 --> 00:31:47,592
<b>Not sure.</b>

460
00:31:49,093 --> 00:31:52,221
<b>So, this will be managed by Song & Kim
from now on, right?</b>

461
00:31:52,305 --> 00:31:54,307
<b>Oh, yes. That's right.</b>

462
00:31:55,058 --> 00:31:57,393
<b>Were these left by the person
who was previously in charge?</b>

463
00:31:57,977 --> 00:31:59,187
<b>What's going on?</b>

464
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:00,688
<b>Who's that person?</b>

465
00:32:01,397 --> 00:32:02,607
<b>Ms. Seo Jeong-hwa.</b>

466
00:32:05,276 --> 00:32:06,569
<b>What? Who?</b>

467
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:08,654
<b>Seo Jeong-hwa. That lady.</b>

468
00:32:09,238 --> 00:32:10,156
<b>She owns a gallery.</b>

469
00:32:16,746 --> 00:32:19,749
<b>The paintings that
Seo Jeong-hwa used to manage</b>

470
00:32:19,832 --> 00:32:23,669
<b>were all purchased by White Hotel
through ArtSky.</b>

471
00:32:23,753 --> 00:32:25,129
<b>In other words,</b>

472
00:32:26,005 --> 00:32:27,673
<b>they're owned by Chairman Son.</b>

473
00:32:30,676 --> 00:32:32,220
<b>Why are you telling me this?</b>

474
00:32:36,849 --> 00:32:37,975
<b>Because I'm a lawyer too.</b>

475
00:32:42,355 --> 00:32:43,398
<b>You see,</b>

476
00:32:44,816 --> 00:32:48,403
<b>I also regret wrapping up
Ha Chan-ho's first trial like that.</b>

477
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:55,952
<b>Thanks.</b>

478
00:33:03,668 --> 00:33:05,586
<b>I'll be off, then.</b>

479
00:33:15,888 --> 00:33:17,098
<b>Hee-jae.</b>

480
00:33:18,015 --> 00:33:19,142
<b>I...</b>

481
00:33:21,227 --> 00:33:24,355
<b>I'm not sure when and how
things started going wrong.</b>

482
00:33:25,773 --> 00:33:29,944
<b>I also don't know why I'm still
at Song & Kim when you guys are all there.</b>

483
00:33:38,494 --> 00:33:39,620
<b>Gi-hyeok.</b>

484
00:33:40,872 --> 00:33:42,999
<b>Don't beat yourself up
for something that's been done.</b>

485
00:33:43,833 --> 00:33:47,420
<b>It's not like you can change
what's already been done.</b>

486
00:33:48,838 --> 00:33:49,755
<b>Just</b>

487
00:33:50,256 --> 00:33:52,592
<b>focus on the present.</b>

488
00:33:53,176 --> 00:33:55,553
<b>And what you should do from now on.</b>

489
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:00,141
<b>If we start regretting
what we did in the past,</b>

490
00:34:00,224 --> 00:34:02,185
<b>I should go jump
into the Han River or something.</b>

491
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:07,023
<b>When you jump,</b>

492
00:34:08,149 --> 00:34:10,401
<b>-I'll do it with you.
-Jeez, you fool.</b>

493
00:34:11,486 --> 00:34:13,863
<b>What I'm saying is, we shouldn't do that.</b>

494
00:34:13,946 --> 00:34:16,491
<b>I just want to do things with you,
no matter what it is.</b>

495
00:34:20,703 --> 00:34:21,746
<b>Jeez.</b>

496
00:34:39,931 --> 00:34:42,183
<b>These guys are our staff.</b>

497
00:34:42,934 --> 00:34:44,227
<b>Yes, that's right.</b>

498
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:45,853
<b>B1 PARKING LOT</b>

499
00:34:47,647 --> 00:34:49,232
<b>I don't recognize that car though.</b>

500
00:34:50,191 --> 00:34:52,944
<b>Isn't it from a cleaning company?
It's not you guys?</b>

501
00:34:53,152 --> 00:34:55,530
<b>No, it's not us.</b>

502
00:34:56,072 --> 00:34:58,449
<b>Does White Hotel work
with another cleaning company?</b>

503
00:34:58,616 --> 00:35:00,493
<b>No, we have an exclusive contract
with them.</b>

504
00:35:02,036 --> 00:35:03,621
<b>Who are these people?</b>

505
00:35:14,924 --> 00:35:18,302
<b>You couldn't find any information
on this company called Cleaning?</b>

506
00:35:18,386 --> 00:35:21,138
<b>No. I did a thorough search online,
and this company doesn't exist.</b>

507
00:35:21,722 --> 00:35:23,808
<b>I called every company
that has a similar name,</b>

508
00:35:23,933 --> 00:35:25,977
<b>but none of them has any connection
with White Hotel.</b>

509
00:35:26,644 --> 00:35:28,396
<b>Okay. Thanks.</b>

510
00:35:29,355 --> 00:35:31,399
<b>Reorganize the list of cars

511
00:35:31,983 --> 00:35:33,276
<b>-What?
-What?</b>

512
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:39,282
<b>-Goodness.
-Gosh.</b>

513
00:35:45,663 --> 00:35:46,872
<b>Let's cheer up.</b>

514
00:35:48,666 --> 00:35:51,836
<b>Issume has been financing
presidential campaigns,</b>

515
00:35:51,919 --> 00:35:56,299
<b>and Song Pil-jung has been the middleman
between Issume and the candidates.</b>

516
00:35:56,382 --> 00:35:58,259
<b>And after taking office at the Blue House,</b>

517
00:35:58,342 --> 00:36:01,304
<b>they had to repay Issume and Song Pil-jung
during their terms.</b>

518
00:36:01,387 --> 00:36:05,016
<b>That's how Song & Kim has managed
to stay at the top all these years.</b>

519
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:08,436
<b>And they're planning to do
the exact same thing again</b>

520
00:36:08,686 --> 00:36:10,980
<b>for Lee In-yeop,
the presidential candidate.</b>

521
00:36:11,063 --> 00:36:14,859
<b>Then it's true that
Judge Yoon gave Issume special treatment.</b>

522
00:36:19,196 --> 00:36:22,575
<b>They even made him
the Supreme Court Justice.</b>

523
00:36:22,658 --> 00:36:26,162
<b>But at a critical moment, my father...</b>

524
00:36:27,622 --> 00:36:28,581
<b>No, I mean...</b>

525
00:36:30,207 --> 00:36:33,252
<b>Judge Yoon Chung-yeon rebelled.</b>

526
00:36:33,336 --> 00:36:35,296
<b>I understand all the facts.</b>

527
00:36:36,088 --> 00:36:38,132
<b>However, we should still say</b>

528
00:36:38,424 --> 00:36:41,260
<b>he was never bribed
for the verdict in favor of them,</b>

529
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:43,846
<b>and he had no say in being appointed
Supreme Court Justice.</b>

530
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:45,890
<b>The verdict was at his sole discretion,</b>

531
00:36:45,973 --> 00:36:48,017
<b>and it cannot be considered
abuse of authority.</b>

532
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:50,603
<b>That will be our argument, right?</b>

533
00:36:51,562 --> 00:36:52,938
<b>No, we'll do the opposite of that.</b>

534
00:36:53,564 --> 00:36:57,151
<b>We'll admit everything.</b>

535
00:36:57,234 --> 00:37:00,655
<b>And during the trial,
we'll uncover the truth behind it all</b>

536
00:37:01,238 --> 00:37:03,824
<b>and reveal their connections.</b>

537
00:37:03,908 --> 00:37:05,618
<b>Isn't that prosecutors' job though?</b>

538
00:37:06,452 --> 00:37:08,371
<b>You said you'll defend your father.</b>

539
00:37:08,454 --> 00:37:11,374
<b>The current and former CEOs
of Issume's subsidiaries</b>

540
00:37:11,457 --> 00:37:15,294
<b>violated the law to make sure
Ha Chan-ho could inherit the company,</b>

541
00:37:15,378 --> 00:37:17,546
<b>yet my father acquitted them.</b>

542
00:37:18,714 --> 00:37:19,965
<b>That is wrong.</b>

543
00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:22,510
<b>And it is considered</b>

544
00:37:23,177 --> 00:37:24,512
<b>abuse of authority.</b>

545
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:28,641
<b>The court is at recess,</b>

546
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:30,685
<b>but it got scheduled right away.</b>

547
00:37:31,769 --> 00:37:32,895
<b>The key is,</b>

548
00:37:33,688 --> 00:37:35,731
<b>will your father admit to it?</b>

549
00:37:36,315 --> 00:37:37,942
<b>That his verdict was wrong.</b>

550
00:37:40,111 --> 00:37:41,112
<b>He will.</b>

551
00:37:43,656 --> 00:37:44,615
<b>He promised me</b>

552
00:37:45,199 --> 00:37:46,575
<b>that he will.</b>

553
00:37:49,704 --> 00:37:51,706
<b>I'm so confused right now.</b>

554
00:37:52,832 --> 00:37:54,291
<b>What is the goal of--</b>

555
00:37:54,375 --> 00:37:56,377
<b>That will be the beginning.</b>

556
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:58,295
<b>He must admit
that he abused his authority.</b>

557
00:37:58,379 --> 00:38:00,798
<b>Only then will his motive gain importance.</b>

558
00:38:01,048 --> 00:38:02,133
<b>And only then</b>

559
00:38:03,426 --> 00:38:06,971
<b>can we take Song Pil-jung down.</b>

560
00:38:19,775 --> 00:38:20,985
<b><i>Yes, Dad.</i></b>

561
00:38:21,652 --> 00:38:23,112
<b>Don't worry too much.</b>

562
00:38:23,821 --> 00:38:27,533
<b>Remember what we discussed?
That's all you need to do.</b>

563
00:38:29,410 --> 00:38:30,411
<b><i>All right.</i></b>

564
00:38:45,259 --> 00:38:47,887
<b>I'll need Ha Chan-ho on the witness stand.</b>

565
00:38:48,345 --> 00:38:50,765
<b>After all, he benefited the most
from that trial.</b>

566
00:38:53,058 --> 00:38:55,728
<b>Will he do it though?</b>

567
00:38:56,145 --> 00:38:58,439
<b>We'll be defending him
in the court of appeal,</b>

568
00:38:58,522 --> 00:39:01,525
<b>so I'm pretty sure he's desperate
to get on our good side.</b>

569
00:39:01,776 --> 00:39:05,029
<b>Because he'll have to spend
eight years in jail otherwise.</b>

570
00:39:07,406 --> 00:39:09,784
<b>Are you going to strike a deal with him
or something?</b>

571
00:39:12,077 --> 00:39:13,746
<b>If that's our only option.</b>

572
00:39:14,121 --> 00:39:16,457
<b>I learned it from you.</b>

573
00:39:23,672 --> 00:39:25,800
<b>But revealing your father's wrong deeds</b>

574
00:39:26,258 --> 00:39:28,594
<b>will disgrace your family,

<b>I'm doing it for my family's honor.</b>

<b>Admitting your mistake</b>

578
00:39:41,524 --> 00:39:45,444
<b>is harder than making one

579

<b>Yes, that's the spirit.</b>

581

<b>Defendant Yoon Chung-yeon,</b>
