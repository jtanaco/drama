4

<b>Why did you do this to me?</b>

5
00:00:24,383 --> 00:00:26,719
<b>-Put it down!
-Why did you do that to her?</b>

6
00:00:29,722 --> 00:00:30,556
<b>That's enough.</b>

7

<b>-Move aside.
-You can blame him for his mistakes.</b>

<b>Do not look down on his sincerity.</b>

<b>EPISODE 14</b>

34
00:04:10,901 --> 00:04:12,361
<b>It happened over ten years ago.</b>

35
00:04:13,278 --> 00:04:15,072
<b>Sergeant Song Gyeong-su</b>

36
00:04:16,156 --> 00:04:18,283
<b>who was dispatched
to the National Police Agency</b>

37
00:04:19,368 --> 00:04:20,827
<b>suggested forming Rugal.</b>

38
00:04:22,537 --> 00:04:25,999
<b>He had been my partner for a long time
and was Mi-na's father.</b>

39
00:04:28,252 --> 00:04:29,086
<b>Mi-na's father?</b>

40
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:33,173
<b>Did you already know?</b>

41
00:04:34,758 --> 00:04:35,717
<b>Go on, sir.</b>

42
00:04:36,426 --> 00:04:38,470
<b>Even before he became a police officer,</b>

43
00:04:39,263 --> 00:04:40,973
<b>Sergeant Song was on the advisory council</b>

44
00:04:41,056 --> 00:04:43,684
<b>to make robots with increased abilities
for the Ministry of Defense.</b>

45
00:04:44,518 --> 00:04:46,061
<b>He was a distinguished scientist.</b>

46
00:04:46,645 --> 00:04:50,607
<b>It was hard to keep Argos under control
with the manpower from the police.</b>

47
00:04:51,191 --> 00:04:53,068
<b>So the confidential project we started</b>

48
00:04:53,151 --> 00:04:54,528
<b>became you guys.</b>

49
00:04:55,821 --> 00:04:56,905
<b>The Rugal Project.</b>

50
00:04:57,489 --> 00:04:59,074
<b>That's enough history lesson for today.</b>

51
00:04:59,658 --> 00:05:01,952
<b>People who had been on this project,
including my father,</b>

52
00:05:02,661 --> 00:05:04,913
<b>were aware of how dangerous
this project could be.</b>

53
00:05:04,997 --> 00:05:06,707
<b>But they still applied to be on it.</b>

54
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:09,126
<b>That's right.</b>

55
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:12,170
<b>Only those who were resolute
to make a change have joined us.</b>

56
00:05:13,171 --> 00:05:14,506
<b>But that determination</b>

57
00:05:16,341 --> 00:05:17,843
<b>wasn't enough to change reality.</b>

58
00:05:46,747 --> 00:05:47,622
<b>Chief Choi.</b>

59
00:05:48,457 --> 00:05:49,750
<b>Did we...</b>

60
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:50,917
<b>No.</b>

61
00:05:51,585 --> 00:05:53,962
<b>Did I end up joining the team
based on your plan?</b>

62
00:05:54,796 --> 00:05:55,839
<b>You guys are different.</b>

63
00:05:56,465 --> 00:05:57,799
<b>Your involvement wasn't planned.</b>

64
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,177
<b>And I was lucky to have you.</b>

65
00:06:00,886 --> 00:06:02,763
<b>Tae-woong became
the first successful member.</b>

66
00:06:03,346 --> 00:06:05,474
<b>And then, you and Mi-na joined, too.</b>

67
00:06:05,557 --> 00:06:07,559
<b>Seeing how you became part of the team</b>

68
00:06:08,518 --> 00:06:09,770
<b>gave me this thought.</b>

69
00:06:10,937 --> 00:06:12,439
<b>"I shouldn't just be waiting.</b>

70
00:06:13,982 --> 00:06:15,734
<b>Why don't I look for one myself?"</b>

71
00:06:15,817 --> 00:06:17,444
<b>Is that how you found</b>

72
00:06:19,613 --> 00:06:20,655
<b>Gi-beom?</b>

<b>PERSONNEL FILE</b>

74
00:06:30,582 --> 00:06:32,751
<i><b>We had just finished developing
the artificial eyes.</i></b>

75
00:06:34,211 --> 00:06:36,630
<i><b>And I needed an individual
that could handle the eyes.</i></b>

76
00:06:36,713 --> 00:06:37,672
<b>PERSONNEL FILE</b>

77
00:06:40,258 --> 00:06:41,843
<i><b>He was physically gifted.</i></b>

78
00:06:42,761 --> 00:06:45,263
<i><b>He had ambition and was competitive
which was typical for a cop.</i></b>

79
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:48,892
<b>On top of that, he was mentally stable.</b>

80
00:06:50,769 --> 00:06:52,604
<b>He was the perfect fit.</b>

81
00:06:53,188 --> 00:06:55,148
<b>Why didn't you tell him the truth
from the start?</b>

82
00:06:55,232 --> 00:06:56,858
<b>That you needed Gi-beom's help.</b>

83
00:06:56,942 --> 00:07:01,113
<b>I had no idea that
he would go after Ko Yong-deok.</b>

84
00:07:01,696 --> 00:07:03,073
<b>The situation changed rapidly.</b>

85
00:07:03,657 --> 00:07:04,533
<b>At that rate,</b>

86
00:07:05,367 --> 00:07:07,953
<b>I had to watch Gi-beom getting killed.</b>

87
00:07:08,745 --> 00:07:09,746
<b>Is that why</b>

88
00:07:10,705 --> 00:07:12,582
<b>you devised such a plan
with Detective Yang?</b>

89
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:14,793
<b>I thought it could be our opportunity.</b>

90
00:07:14,876 --> 00:07:18,422
<b>I decided to take the role of giving him</b>

91
00:07:18,505 --> 00:07:21,299
<b>a nudge in the right direction
to reach his full potential.</b>

92
00:07:21,383 --> 00:07:23,468
<b>Is that why you got his wife involved?</b>

93
00:07:25,345 --> 00:07:27,389
<b>Even at the expense of killing Yeo-jin?</b>

94
00:07:27,472 --> 00:07:29,349
<b>I didn't think this would happen</b>

95
00:07:30,767 --> 00:07:31,768
<b>to Yeo-jin.</b>

96
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,272
<b>Logically, I follow your plan,</b>

97
00:07:36,148 --> 00:07:37,983
<b>but it's hard to emotionally accept it.</b>

98
00:07:39,025 --> 00:07:40,986
<b>While I wish Gi-beom to understand you,</b>

99
00:07:43,321 --> 00:07:44,489
<b>my heart breaks for him.</b>

100
00:07:45,615 --> 00:07:47,242
<b>I think you need time to process this.</b>

101
00:07:47,742 --> 00:07:48,994
<b>For you, chief.</b>

102
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:51,621
<b>And for Gi-beom.</b>

103
00:08:28,658 --> 00:08:29,576
<b>Water.</b>

104
00:08:31,203 --> 00:08:32,037
<b>Water...</b>

105
00:08:33,497 --> 00:08:34,748
<b>Help me.</b>

106
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,876
<b>Help me.</b>

107
00:08:49,221 --> 00:08:51,139
<b>Did you find her?</b>

108
00:08:53,725 --> 00:08:54,935
<b>Did you see your wife?</b>

109
00:08:55,936 --> 00:08:58,021
<b>I was the one who found her.</b>

110
00:08:58,522 --> 00:09:00,023
<b>I'm not trying to take credit.</b>

111
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:02,400
<b>Can you give me some water?</b>

112
00:09:41,982 --> 00:09:43,024
<i><b>Kill him.</i></b>

113
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:01,042
<b>Dead.</b>

114
00:10:03,795 --> 00:10:05,922
<b>Find me everything
Choi Geun-cheol hid from me.</b>

115
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:11,928
<b>It scared the crap out of me earlier.</b>

116
00:10:14,723 --> 00:10:15,765
<b>What do you mean?</b>

117
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:18,101
<b>When you two were fighting.</b>

118
00:10:19,728 --> 00:10:21,438
<b>"What if I lose one of you?</b>

119
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:23,857
<b>Does it mean I have to take revenge?"</b>

120
00:10:25,525 --> 00:10:26,651
<b>But both of you</b>

121
00:10:28,153 --> 00:10:29,237
<b>are my close friends</b>

122
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,531
<b>and I like you both.</b>

123
00:10:32,532 --> 00:10:33,366
<b>That won't happen.</b>

124
00:10:36,202 --> 00:10:38,705
<b>But you weren't worried about Chief Choi?</b>

125
00:10:39,873 --> 00:10:42,000
<b>I felt reassured
because you were protecting him.</b>

126
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:43,710
<b>Or I could've sacrificed my body.</b>

127
00:10:45,629 --> 00:10:48,465
<b>If Chief Choi hears that,
he might be disappointed.</b>

128
00:10:51,343 --> 00:10:53,053
<b>Gi-beom was probably disappointed, right?</b>

129
00:10:54,054 --> 00:10:56,765
<b>In you and me, right?</b>

130
00:10:56,848 --> 00:10:58,058
<b>He's not that petty.</b>

131
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:03,396
<b>Seeing how he took a step back,
he probably understands our situation.</b>

132
00:11:06,149 --> 00:11:07,567
<b>That's what worries me more.</b>

133
00:11:09,569 --> 00:11:11,529
<b>That he might try to shoulder</b>

134
00:11:14,074 --> 00:11:15,533
<b>all the burdens and pain by himself.</b>

135
00:11:52,987 --> 00:11:54,447
<b>No one would be able to forgive</b>

136
00:11:56,282 --> 00:11:57,951
<b>after seeing this.</b>

137
00:11:59,119 --> 00:12:00,370
<b>Did you find out more</b>

138
00:12:01,538 --> 00:12:02,831
<b>about how she'd been living?</b>

139
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:05,166
<b>I didn't have time to talk to Gi-beom.</b>

140
00:12:06,709 --> 00:12:10,004
<b>And what you already know
is the extent of my information.</b>

141
00:12:11,631 --> 00:12:13,091
<b>I should have looked for her</b>

142
00:12:14,259 --> 00:12:15,468
<b>no matter what it took.</b>

143
00:12:20,223 --> 00:12:21,474
<b>I can't side with you</b>

144
00:12:22,517 --> 00:12:23,852
<b>on this matter.</b>

145
00:12:26,563 --> 00:12:27,397
<b>Okay.</b>

146
00:12:29,149 --> 00:12:30,817
<b>Thank you for being honest with me.</b>

147
00:12:31,734 --> 00:12:34,320
<b>Gi-beom's feeling
is the most important thing right now.</b>

148
00:12:35,613 --> 00:12:36,948
<b>Why did you do it?</b>

149
00:12:37,949 --> 00:12:41,828
<b>It would've been better
if you were honest with him.</b>

150
00:12:45,248 --> 00:12:47,333
<b>What if his surgery didn't work?</b>

151
00:12:48,543 --> 00:12:50,295
<b>What were you going to do, then?</b>

152
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:54,549
<b>Do you think there's anyone
who knows Gi-beom as well as I do?</b>

153
00:12:56,968 --> 00:13:00,346
<b>The thought of the surgery failing
didn't even cross my mind.</b>

154
00:13:02,307 --> 00:13:03,433
<b>No.</b>

155
00:13:04,642 --> 00:13:06,686
<b>If you knew him that well
and believed in him,</b>

156
00:13:08,104 --> 00:13:09,939
<b>you should have told him the whole truth.</b>

157
00:13:11,816 --> 00:13:15,778
<b>If this was between two people,

<b>Or is someone helping you out

174

<b>If not that, you must have been trained

198

<b>As of this moment, cut the artificial
eyes' access to our servers.</b>

<b>-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.</b>

202
00:17:15,852 --> 00:17:19,272
<b>His behaviors towards you seem to stem

<b>But I cannot allow insubordination.</b>

251

<b>You think you can leave here alive?</b>

561
00:50:52,917 --> 00:50:55,420
<b>I guess you'll let me live

00:50:57,839 --> 00:51:00,050
<b>Money makes you worthy, is that it?</b>

564
00:51:00,383 --> 00:51:02,594
<b>To hell with that.</b>

565
00:51:14,773 --> 00:51:16,775
<b>I know you want Argos for yourself,</b>

00:51:34,709 --> 00:51:35,543
<b>Why?</b>

571
00:51:36,544 --> 00:51:37,420
<b>Don't you want me?</b>

572
00:51:57,399 --> 00:51:58,692
<b>It's funny how you seem startled.</b>

<b>You knew this day would come.</b>

00:52:04,698 --> 00:52:06,825
<b>You're startled even though

<b>to be ambushed by you.</b>

578
00:52:12,997 --> 00:52:13,915
<b>I'm truly sorry.</b>

579
00:52:15,083 --> 00:52:16,584
<b>There's nothing more I can say.</b>

580
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:18,294
<b>My friend,</b>

581
00:52:20,088 --> 00:52:21,965
<b>were you actually my friend?</b>

582
00:52:24,676 --> 00:52:29,180
<b>I tried to persuade Yeo-jin

<b>Well, don't worry.</b>

585
00:52:34,644 --> 00:52:36,646
<b>I'm also not in the mood

<b>I knew that he'd be

589
00:53:03,882 --> 00:53:05,633
<b>I made a fair warning.</b>

590
00:53:06,968 --> 00:53:09,888
<b>I also read the files on the chief.</b>

591

<b>I'm now aware that Hwang Deuk-gu

<b>Is that your reason for shooting me?</b>

593
00:53:21,357 --> 00:53:24,277
<b>What Chief Choi did was despicable,

594
00:53:25,069 --> 00:53:26,863
<b>What Mun-bok did was wrong,</b>

595

<b>but killing him isn't the answer.</b>

596
00:53:30,283 --> 00:53:32,494
<b>Hwang Deuk-gu is the one
we must truly eliminate.</b>

597
00:53:32,577 --> 00:53:35,663
<b>So why are you going after others
instead of tracking him down?</b>

598
00:53:36,331 --> 00:53:39,417
<b>Gi-beom, don't do this.</b>

599
00:53:40,794 --> 00:53:42,003
<b>Please, stop.</b>

600
00:53:48,885 --> 00:53:51,596
<i><b>Because you show them mercy,

601
00:53:52,889 --> 00:53:55,183

602
00:54:09,906 --> 00:54:10,782
<i><b>Kill her.</i></b>

603
00:54:12,283 --> 00:54:13,159
<b>Shut up.</b>

00:54:16,162 --> 00:54:16,996
<b>Gi-beom?</b>

605
00:54:21,709 --> 00:54:22,710
<b>Gi-beom!</b>

606
00:54:37,475 --> 00:54:39,143
<b>He's been dead for a while.</b>

607
00:54:40,770 --> 00:54:41,855
<b>Is he really</b>

608
00:54:42,897 --> 00:54:44,315
<b>going to kill them all?</b>

609
00:54:44,399 --> 00:54:46,776
<b>Detective Yang would've died too

610
00:54:46,860 --> 00:54:48,570
<b>Instead of waiting for him to return,</b>

611
00:54:49,153 --> 00:54:50,446
<b>shouldn't we put him down?</b>

<b>We'll do what it takes to help him first.</b>

613
00:55:12,886 --> 00:55:13,928
<i><b>Attack.</i></b>

614
00:55:25,815 --> 00:55:26,941
<i><b>Kill them</i></b>

615
00:55:28,192 --> 00:55:29,235
<i><b>all.</i></b>

616
00:56:06,397 --> 00:56:09,525
<b>If my artificial eyes are like computers,</b>

617
00:56:10,026 --> 00:56:12,070
<b>could they be formatted or reset?</b>

618
00:56:12,153 --> 00:56:14,280
<b>Can installing the software again
erase any errors?</b>

619
00:56:15,239 --> 00:56:16,699
<b>Broadly speaking, they're similar.</b>

620
00:56:17,033 --> 00:56:19,243
<b>But the smaller details are more complex.</b>

621
00:56:19,327 --> 00:56:21,245
<b>Imagine a big factory.</b>

622
00:56:21,329 --> 00:56:23,289
<b>There are a lot of processes
that are operating.</b>

623
00:56:23,373 --> 00:56:25,041
<b>If pressing a button could mess it all up,</b>

624
00:56:25,166 --> 00:56:26,751
<b>the system wouldn't be stable.</b>

625
00:56:27,251 --> 00:56:29,337
<b>You need backup generators
and backup files</b>

626
00:56:29,420 --> 00:56:31,506
<b>to fill in the parts that get broken.</b>

627
00:56:31,589 --> 00:56:33,716
<b>Still, when things get out of hand,</b>

628
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:35,635
<b>you want to wipe the slate clean
and start over.</b>

629
00:56:36,552 --> 00:56:39,681
<b>You'll need more than your regular trauma
to see any changes in the eyes.</b>

630
00:56:40,390 --> 00:56:42,850
<b>However, if the tree trunk won't budge,</b>

631

<b>we can go after the roots.</b>

632
00:56:45,395 --> 00:56:47,438
<b>Remember the chip
embedded in the back of your head?</b>

633
00:56:47,522 --> 00:56:48,523
<b>That...</b>

634
00:56:51,109 --> 00:56:52,777
<b>I shouldn't be telling you this.</b>

635
00:57:14,424 --> 00:57:16,050
<i><b>You want to get rid of me?</i></b>

636
00:57:17,302 --> 00:57:20,305
<i><b>If you do, it'll be the end of you too.</i></b>

637
00:57:21,347 --> 00:57:22,682
<i><b>We can do this ourselves.</i></b>

638
00:57:25,518 --> 00:57:26,728
<b>Stop this.</b>

639
00:57:26,811 --> 00:57:28,479
<i><b>Why do we need Rugal anyway?</i></b>

640
00:57:29,063 --> 00:57:30,356
<i><b>We can kill them all.</i></b>

641
00:57:32,984 --> 00:57:34,235
<b>I won't do that.</b>

642
00:57:34,819 --> 00:57:36,654
<i><b>You will end up doing so.</i></b>

643
00:57:46,539 --> 00:57:48,541
<b>Did you just make me kneel?</b>

644
00:57:49,792 --> 00:57:51,419
<b>You've chosen the wrong guy to mess with.</b>

645
00:57:51,669 --> 00:57:53,838
<b>I won't go down without a fight.</b>

646
00:57:53,921 --> 00:57:55,340
<i><b>I can do</i></b>

647
00:57:56,674 --> 00:57:57,842
<b>so much more.</b>

648
00:58:08,311 --> 00:58:11,439
<b>Is that coming from your eyes
that mistook me for a test subject</b>

649
00:58:12,023 --> 00:58:13,274
<b>and made you attack me?</b>

650
00:58:24,243 --> 00:58:25,286
<b>Calm down, Gi-beom.</b>

651
00:58:25,870 --> 00:58:26,913
<b>Compose yourself!</b>

652
00:58:26,996 --> 00:58:28,539
<b>Don't do this.</b>

653
00:58:29,165 --> 00:58:30,541
<b>Please, stop.</b>

654
00:58:40,051 --> 00:58:41,594
<b>I won't let you have it your way.</b>

655

<i><b>Even if I do this?</i></b>

656

657

658

<b>How are you holding up?</b>

659
01:00:05,928 --> 01:00:07,930
<b>I doubt any of us is unfazed by all this.</b>

660
01:00:10,099 --> 01:00:11,642
<b>We have more people now</b>

661

<i><b>I'd like to meet.</i></b>

665
