<b>(Woori King Dumplings)</b>

4
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:39,409
<b>Is this the place?</b>

5
00:00:39,469 --> 00:00:41,786
<b>The previous owner ran off
in the middle of the night, right?</b>

6
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:43,979
<b>We lucked out because of it though.</b>

7
00:00:44,609 --> 00:00:45,679
<b>Shall we take a look?</b>

8
00:00:46,549 --> 00:00:48,420
<b>- Okay.
- Let's take a look.</b>

9
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:56,590
<b>Are you kidding me?</b>

10
00:00:57,289 --> 00:00:59,159
<b>Shouldn't we see
who our neighbors are?</b>

11
00:00:59,729 --> 00:01:00,859
<b>No, keep your eyes on me.</b>

12
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:03,735
<b>What a mess.</b>

13
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:06,345
<b>It's as if a tornado
blast through here.</b>

14

<b>What's worse than a tornado
are creditors.</b>

15
00:01:10,269 --> 00:01:12,486
<b>Still, it's not as bad as I thought.</b>

16
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:14,870
<b>The tables and chairs
are good enough.</b>

17
00:01:15,379 --> 00:01:17,055
<b>Most of the cooking utensils
are still there...</b>

18
00:01:17,079 --> 00:01:18,355
<b>and the stove
works perfectly well too.</b>

19
00:01:18,379 --> 00:01:22,126
<b>It's a good thing we found a store
where the owner just took off.</b>

20
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:24,495
<b>All we need really is a new sign.</b>

21
00:01:24,519 --> 00:01:28,195
<b>There's even a small room
where I can sleep.</b>

22
00:01:28,219 --> 00:01:30,835
<b>The two of us
will be commuting anyway.</b>

23

<b>Cho Yeon, are you sure
about just selling kimbap though?</b>

24
00:01:34,689 --> 00:01:37,335
<b>Shouldn't we at least
have some soup with it?</b>

25
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:39,670
<b>How about udon? Can you make one?</b>

26
00:01:41,069 --> 00:01:42,229
<b>What about buckwheat noodles?</b>

27
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:44,676
<b>- There's one thing I'm good at.
- What's that?</b>

28
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,385
<b>- A fruit salad!
- Darn it.</b>

29
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:48,516
<b>It's of a liquid base, isn't it?</b>

30
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,579
<b>Let's just stick to ramyeon, okay?</b>

31
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,885
<b>Hold on. How about Unnie's Kimbap?</b>

32
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:55,950
<b>- What are you talking about?
- Come on.</b>

33
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:57,555
<b>I mean for the name.</b>

34
00:01:57,579 --> 00:01:59,719
<b>We'll call it Unnie's Kimbap.</b>

35
00:02:00,489 --> 00:02:02,366
<b>I think it has
a familiar ring to it.</b>

36
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:03,635
<b>I love it too.</b>

37
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:07,159
<b>Good then.
We have a name for our diner.</b>

38

<b>All we need to do now is make money.</b>

39

<b>Let's make it rain!</b>

40
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:13,806
<b>Yes, let's do it.</b>

41

<b>- Go, Unnie's Kimbap.
- Go, Unnie's Kimbap.</b>

42

<b>- Let's clean this place up.
- Sure.</b>

43
00:02:21,169 --> 00:02:23,316
<b>Gosh, I'm late.</b>

44
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:24,539
<b>Darn it.</b>

00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,310
<b>I'm late!</b>

<b>I can't believe you, you know.</b>

47

<b>Couldn't you have woken me up?</b>

48

<b>Keep getting dressed unless
you want to show me more skin.</b>

<b>Yes, the mail came in this morning.</b>

55
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,759
<b>So much for
a dramatic turn of events.</b>

56
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:11,620
<b>Although, I guess
it's what I expected.</b>

57

<b>What now?</b>

58
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:15,776
<b>Will you keep on
working here together?</b>

59
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,460
<b>I get that about the house,</b>

60
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,270
<b>but isn't it awkward here?</b>

61
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:20,846
<b>Of course, it is.</b>

62
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:22,615
<b>One of us

<b>Have you had any offers?</b>

64

<b>I'm sure many hospitals

<b>I've been searching,</b>

<b>but none are close

<b>We both want

<b>I guess Hanseo University Hospital

<b>Hanseo Hospital?</b>

<b>I value my free time, remember?</b>

<b>I hate places

<b>You should be able

<b>But...</b>

91

<b>I don't know,

93
00:04:49,819 --> 00:04:51,259
<b>The lady at
the dried fish store...</b>

94
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:53,060
<b>said that they had
on sexy outfits...</b>

95
00:04:53,089 --> 00:04:54,935
<b>and was wearing red lipstick.</b>

96
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:57,459
<b>They even had double the volume
in their hair.</b>

97

<b>Anyway, I hear that
they're quite crude.</b>

98
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:02,375
<b>The lady at the dried fish store
is probably exaggerating.</b>

99

<b>You know how she is.</b>

100
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:07,370
<b>No way. She seems
to be onto something this time.</b>

101

<b>They don't seem like ordinary women.</b>

102

<b>What else can they be though?</b>

103
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:15,286
<b>Oh, come on. This again?</b>

104
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:18,456
<b>Why does this always happen
when someone new joins the market?</b>

105
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:21,196
<b>Who cares what they did
before coming here?</b>

106

<b>How can you say that?</b>

<b>about them ruining

<b>That is why

00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:38,495
<b>Congratulations.</b>

154
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:41,235
<b>Was what you said to the chairman
ad-libbed or rehearsed?</b>

155
00:07:41,259 --> 00:07:43,459
<b>Rehearsed of course!</b>

156
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:45,545
<b>- I'll get going then.
- Sure. Take care.</b>

157
00:07:45,569 --> 00:07:47,305
<b>- I'll call you sometime.
- Sure thing.</b>

158
00:07:47,329 --> 00:07:48,706
<b>Did you book us the restaurant?</b>

159
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:50,115
<b>Of course.</b>

160
00:07:50,139 --> 00:07:52,716
<b>We'll be clearing out
all the meat there.</b>

161
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,815
<b>I'm ready to have
my wallet burned through,</b>

162
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:56,956
<b>- so do your worst.
- Nice.</b>

163
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,540
<b>Let's go!</b>

164
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:00,656
<b>Good job, guys.
Let's grab a bite to eat.</b>

165
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,350
<b>It'll be on me.</b>

166
00:08:02,579 --> 00:08:04,220
<b>Dinner?</b>

167
00:08:04,379 --> 00:08:06,925
<b>Gosh, I'm sorry,
but it's my mother's birthday today.</b>

168
00:08:06,949 --> 00:08:08,565
<b>And I've been suffering
from a terrible headache.</b>

169
00:08:08,589 --> 00:08:11,959
<b>My friends are out front
and they've been calling me.</b>

170
00:08:12,189 --> 00:08:13,430
<b>Is that so?</b>

171
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:15,899
<b>I guess
dinner is out of the question then.</b>

172
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:17,759
<b>I'll at least be saving money.</b>

173
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,576
<b>Good job today, guys.</b>

174
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,675
<b>You too.</b>

175
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:21,970
<b>- Good job today.
- Bye.</b>

176
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:25,740
<b>In here, guys.</b>

177
00:08:26,509 --> 00:08:29,410
<b>I hear this place serves great meat.</b>

178
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:32,009
<b>Hey!</b>

179
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:33,649
<b>You guys...</b>

180
00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:35,425
<b>When did you get here?</b>

181
00:08:35,449 --> 00:08:37,296
<b>You move fast
when it comes to these things.</b>

182
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,620
<b>Gyu Jin, you're here.</b>

183
00:08:46,029 --> 00:08:48,535
<b>We were going to celebrate
my mom's birthday,</b>

184
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:50,135
<b>but dinner was postponed.</b>

185
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:51,535
<b>He had a headache,</b>

186
00:08:51,559 --> 00:08:53,375
<b>but now he's doing better.</b>

187
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:56,269
<b>I get it, okay?
I never said anything.</b>

188
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:58,676
<b>Eat up, guys.
Don't let the meat burn.</b>

189
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,440
<b>Go ahead. Here.</b>

190
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:02,240
<b>- Eat up.
- Gosh.</b>

191
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:04,980
<b>You all did great. Now, eat up.</b>

192
00:09:05,409 --> 00:09:06,909
<b>- You too.
- Thanks.</b>

193
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,080
<b>Here you go. Go ahead.</b>

194
00:09:19,529 --> 00:09:20,659
<b>Unbelievable.</b>

195
00:09:21,389 --> 00:09:23,460
<b>They cast her aside
and she went home alone.</b>

196
00:09:25,669 --> 00:09:28,029
<b>This is why she should've
been nicer to them.</b>

197
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:35,779
<b>What...</b>

198
00:09:39,309 --> 00:09:40,309
<b>Hello?</b>

199
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:43,419
<b>Right? I knew it was a stretch.</b>

200
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,990
<b>Don't say that.
I'm the one who's sorry.</b>

201
00:09:46,889 --> 00:09:49,765
<b>Let's grab a drink sometime
when you're less busy.</b>

202
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:51,919
<b>Right, of course.</b>

203
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:52,990
<b>Hello?</b>

204
00:09:57,529 --> 00:09:59,470
<b>Honey, why are you standing there?</b>

205
00:09:59,769 --> 00:10:01,629
<b>- Joon Seon, I'm here too.
- Hi Auntie.</b>

206
00:10:02,169 --> 00:10:04,139
<b>How were things at the market today?</b>

207
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,785
<b>So much for the crabs
being nice and plump.</b>

208
00:10:07,809 --> 00:10:09,655
<b>They're not like that at all.</b>

209
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:11,956
<b>Mom, save some for yourself too.</b>

210
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:13,226
<b>Just eat up.</b>

211
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:15,950
<b>You're home early today though.
What about your part-time job?</b>

212
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:19,320
<b>My boss wanted to close early
and go home.</b>

213
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:23,666
<b>She acts out on a whim
even when she runs her business.</b>

214
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:24,919
<b>She just blows hot and cold.</b>

215
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:27,629
<b>Are you sure she can pay you
working like that?</b>

216
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:30,200
<b>It's nice
that she gets to finish early.</b>

217
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:32,659
<b>How is your studying going?
Is it going well?</b>

218
00:10:32,769 --> 00:10:34,706
<b>Not really. I'm just trying.</b>

219
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:37,539
<b>Don't overwork yourself.
It might shock your head.</b>

220
00:10:38,269 --> 00:10:40,210
<b>I think it's shocked already.</b>

221
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:43,316
<b>My brain is so slow
that I can't keep up with the class.</b>

222
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:46,409
<b>All your hard work will go down
the drain if you get exhausted.</b>

223
00:10:46,649 --> 00:10:49,726
<b>Studying is like a long-term battle.
You should take your time.</b>

224
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:50,820
<b>Okay, Dad.</b>

225
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:54,850
<b>I guess Mom and Dad
only care about Da Hee.</b>

226
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:57,336
<b>Joon Seon, maybe we should also take
college entrance exams...</b>

227
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,690
<b>or realtor qualifications
or whatever.</b>

228
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:03,100
<b>Joon Seon.</b>

229
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,000
<b>Yes? What did you say?</b>

230
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:07,476
<b>What's wrong with him?</b>

231
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,039
<b>Why are you distracted while eating?</b>

232
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:11,370
<b>I'm not feeling well.</b>

233
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,870
<b>Please excuse me.
I enjoyed the dinner.</b>

234
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:21,409
<b>What? He left all his food.</b>

235
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,125
<b>What's wrong with that glutton?</b>

236
00:11:24,149 --> 00:11:25,179
<b>I know.</b>

237
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,365
<b>Is he upset because we didn't
leave him the chicken yesterday?</b>

238
00:11:28,389 --> 00:11:31,019
<b>I guess he has no appetite
what with everything on his mind.</b>

239
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,166
<b>Ok Ja, you should eat some more.</b>

240
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:36,529
<b>Mix your rice in the crab shell.</b>

241
00:11:38,429 --> 00:11:40,446
<b>Young Dal and Ok Boon,
I should get going.</b>

242
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:41,629
<b>I'll see you tomorrow.</b>

243
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:45,600
<b>Ok Ja, wait.</b>

244
00:11:46,009 --> 00:11:47,546
<b>What? Why, Young Dal?</b>

245
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:48,669
<b>Well...</b>

246
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,340
<b>I need to ask you a favor.</b>

247
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:01,490
<b>I should've bought some sushi.</b>

248
00:12:12,059 --> 00:12:13,100
<b>Hello?</b>

249
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:15,370
<b>Dr. Song Na Hee?</b>

250
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:19,070
<b>Yes. This is her. Who is this?</b>

251
00:12:19,539 --> 00:12:20,686
<b>This is Nam Cheol Woo,</b>

252
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:22,230
<b>Chief of Pediatrics
at Hanseo Hospital.</b>

253
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:24,940
<b>We met at the conference today.</b>

254
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:27,909
<b>Oh, right. Hello.
To what do I owe the pleasure?</b>

255
00:12:28,309 --> 00:12:29,679
<b>I enjoyed your presentation today.</b>

256
00:12:30,019 --> 00:12:31,379
<b>Your paper was excellent.</b>

257
00:12:31,549 --> 00:12:34,250
<b>And the alternative you proposed
sounded quite interesting.</b>

258
00:12:34,649 --> 00:12:36,789
<b>Thank you for your kind words.</b>

259
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:38,395
<b>So I was wondering...</b>

260
00:12:38,419 --> 00:12:42,129
<b>There's an opening for
a pediatric research lecturer.</b>

261
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:44,635
<b>You can also get tenure...</b>

262
00:12:44,659 --> 00:12:47,399
<b>based on performance.</b>

263
00:12:48,669 --> 00:12:50,399
<b>I won't beat around the bush.</b>

264
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,440
<b>What do you think, Dr. Song?</b>

265
00:12:52,909 --> 00:12:55,710
<b>Would you be interested in
a job interview at our hospital?</b>

266
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:58,580
<b>Yes, I'd love to.</b>

267
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:01,409
<b>I'll have the documents
ready tomorrow.</b>

268
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:04,980
<b>Okay. I'll see you then. Thank you.</b>

269
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,620
<b>Yes!</b>

270
00:13:11,889 --> 00:13:14,629
<b>Well done, Song Na Hee.</b>

271
00:13:15,059 --> 00:13:17,230
<b>You did a great job.</b>

272
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,775
<b>What are you doing?</b>

273
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,529
<b>I think I have something in my ear.</b>

274
00:13:22,029 --> 00:13:23,676
<b>Why did you come home so early?</b>

275
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,570
<b>You acted like
you'd drink all night.</b>

276
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,916
<b>I'm just trying to get in shape.</b>

277
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,639
<b>I have something going on.</b>

278
00:13:31,139 --> 00:13:32,809
<b>Did you eat instant noodles again?</b>

279
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:40,265
<b>You should keep
your temper in check...</b>

280
00:13:40,289 --> 00:13:43,596
<b>and try to get along
with the junior doctors.</b>

281
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:45,265
<b>Instead of scolding them,</b>

282
00:13:45,289 --> 00:13:48,105
<b>you can buy them a meal
and offer a sympathetic ear.</b>

283
00:13:48,129 --> 00:13:49,775
<b>Why are you being so nosy
all of a sudden?</b>

284
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:51,860
<b>I'm just worried about you.</b>

285
00:13:52,129 --> 00:13:54,046
<b>You at least had me until now,</b>

286
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:56,115
<b>but what will you do now?
Jae Seok is on another team.</b>

287
00:13:56,139 --> 00:13:57,740
<b>I had a harder time because of you.</b>

288
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:59,186
<b>Don't worry.</b>

289
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:00,985
<b>It's all over once I quit.</b>

290
00:14:01,009 --> 00:14:02,485
<b>I know you will quit someday.</b>

291
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:03,855
<b>But before then, you should...</b>

292
00:14:03,879 --> 00:14:06,879
<b>It's not someday.
I'll quit right away.</b>

293
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:08,879
<b>I got a job offer
from Hanseo University.</b>

294
00:14:09,419 --> 00:14:10,419
<b>What?</b>

295
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:13,490
<b>Me too.</b>

296
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:15,690
<b>The research lecturer?</b>

297
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:18,519
<b>With a chance of getting tenure.</b>

298
00:14:20,289 --> 00:14:22,629
<b>- The interview is tomorrow.
- At 12:30.</b>

299
00:14:23,259 --> 00:14:25,429
<b>- At 1:00.
- That's good.</b>

300
00:14:26,429 --> 00:14:28,129
<b>One of us might get the job.</b>

301
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:31,169
<b>We've been uncomfortable
working at the same hospital.</b>

302
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:32,870
<b>I know.</b>

303
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:36,210
<b>They also provide a residence.</b>

304
00:14:36,409 --> 00:14:38,279
<b>Then the house issue
will be settled.</b>

305
00:14:40,649 --> 00:14:43,155

00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:08,565
<b>Wait, wait.
Isn't the music just killer?</b>

460
00:23:08,589 --> 00:23:09,589
<b>Let's dance!</b>

461
00:23:14,029 --> 00:23:16,206
<b>- Not out here.
- Come inside.</b>

462
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:18,275
<b>- Come in.
- We're here!</b>

463
00:23:18,299 --> 00:23:20,029
<b>Oh, my...</b>

464
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:24,569
<b>Ga Yeon, serve that table more jeon.</b>

465
00:23:25,369 --> 00:23:27,216
<b>- Here you go.
- Thanks!</b>

466
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,916
<b>This is amazing.</b>

467
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:31,555
<b>- Cho Yeon, it's a decent space.
- It is.</b>

468
00:23:31,579 --> 00:23:33,525
<b>You look like a real boss.</b>

469
00:23:33,549 --> 00:23:34,680
<b>Thank you.</b>

470
00:23:35,549 --> 00:23:36,696
<b>Eat your fill.</b>

471
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,656
<b>If you need anything, just say so.</b>

472
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,490
<b>Do enjoy yourselves.</b>

473
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:43,535
<b>You too, Dad.</b>

474
00:23:43,559 --> 00:23:46,196
<b>We're here to congratulate you,
so we'll enjoy ourselves.</b>

475
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:47,259
<b>You should.</b>

476
00:23:48,089 --> 00:23:50,335
<b>- Eat up.
- Cho Yeon, the rice cakes!</b>

477
00:23:50,359 --> 00:23:51,835
<b>That was quick.</b>

478
00:23:51,859 --> 00:23:54,775
<b>- Put three on each plate.
- Okay.</b>

479
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:57,376
<b>We might have more visitors,
so you stay here.</b>

480
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,416
<b>Ga Yeon and I will hand them out.</b>

481
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,045
<b>I'll visit the stores on this line.</b>

482
00:24:00,069 --> 00:24:02,545
<b>The fried chicken place is
the association president's store.</b>

483
00:24:02,569 --> 00:24:04,515
<b>I should visit in person and say hi.</b>

484
00:24:04,539 --> 00:24:06,015
<b>- Okay then.
- Is it good?</b>

485
00:24:06,039 --> 00:24:07,055
<b>(Original old-style chicken)</b>

486
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:10,279
<b>My gosh. I've never seen
that kind of an opening before.</b>

487
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:14,220
<b>How can something be
so loud and crazy?</b>

488
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:17,920
<b>Forget the noise.
Did you see the flowers?</b>

489
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:21,065
<b>They were all from bars or pubs.</b>

490
00:24:21,089 --> 00:24:22,936
<b>The women were right.</b>

491
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,976
<b>They're not ordinary women.</b>

492
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,376
<b>The woman who led
all those girls is the boss, right?</b>

493
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,569
<b>She has the word "boss"
practically printed on her face.</b>

494
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,716
<b>Her aura was just...</b>

495
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:35,946
<b>She's stocky and glares like this.</b>

496
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:37,985
<b>Did you see her hairdo?</b>

497
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:39,856
<b>It would poke anyone in the...</b>

498
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,380
<b>Excuse me.</b>

499
00:24:42,079 --> 00:24:43,420
<b>Hello.</b>

500
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:45,325
<b>- Hello.
- Hi.</b>

501
00:24:45,349 --> 00:24:49,166
<b>I opened a kimbap store
a few rows over.</b>

502
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:50,690
<b>I brought rice cakes.</b>

503
00:24:50,819 --> 00:24:52,866
<b>I'll take that. Thank you.</b>

504
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:54,460
<b>Are you the president's wife?</b>

505
00:24:54,589 --> 00:24:57,730
<b>My goodness. You're beautiful.</b>

506
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,775
<b>Oh, no. I'm the younger sister.</b>

507
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:01,906
<b>She's his wife.</b>

508
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:03,315
<b>Oh, no wonder.</b>

509
00:25:03,339 --> 00:25:06,216
<b>My goodness. You're beautiful.</b>

510
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,815
<b>Your skin is so clear
and you're so slim.</b>

511
00:25:08,839 --> 00:25:11,039
<b>You look rich and elegant.</b>

512
00:25:11,309 --> 00:25:14,325
<b>You look like this actress.</b>

513
00:25:14,349 --> 00:25:16,995
<b>Who is it? What's she called?</b>

514
00:25:17,019 --> 00:25:19,279
<b>The one with a pale face
who looks so elegant.</b>

515
00:25:19,549 --> 00:25:22,849
<b>Oh, well, I'm not so sure,
but others say that...</b>

516
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,265
<b>I look like Jeon In Hwa.</b>

517
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:26,396
<b>Is your husband not in?</b>

518
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:28,430
<b>I hoped to say hello to him.</b>

519
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:31,436
<b>He went out to
take care of business.</b>

520
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:35,376
<b>He's in charge of everyone
and everything, so he must be busy.</b>

521
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,676
<b>If he's the president
of the merchant association,</b>

522
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:39,299
<b>that means he's the boss. The head.</b>

523
00:25:40,309 --> 00:25:42,345
<b>Oh, did this
just come out of the fryer?</b>

524
00:25:42,369 --> 00:25:45,579
<b>Gosh, it's a golden yellow.
What a brilliant color.</b>

525
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,085
<b>How much is a large box?</b>

526
00:25:47,109 --> 00:25:49,079
<b>Is a large enough for three?</b>

527
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:52,126
<b>Three people can eat about...</b>

528
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:54,089
<b>Hello? Yes, what?</b>

529
00:25:54,849 --> 00:25:57,335
<b>They're leaving already? Why?</b>

530
00:25:57,359 --> 00:26:00,166
<b>Okay, I'll be right there.
Tell them to wait.</b>

531
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:02,089
<b>Okay, see you soon.</b>

532
00:26:02,859 --> 00:26:04,599
<b>I have to go now.</b>

533
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,606
<b>Please look out for us.</b>

534
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:09,730
<b>When your husband returns,
give him our regards.</b>

535
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,869
<b>It was nice to meet you,
pretty madam.</b>

536
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:16,880
<b>Lipstick.</b>

537
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:23,319
<b>What just blew through?</b>

538
00:26:23,549 --> 00:26:25,656
<b>Dad, can't you stay a while longer?</b>

539
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:26,866
<b>You rarely leave the temple.</b>

540
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:28,650
<b>I'll visit another time.</b>

541
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:31,436
<b>Why follow me out when you're busy?
Go back inside.</b>

542
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:33,930
<b>It's fine.
I'll walk you to the exit.</b>

543
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:37,335
<b>I'm proud of you, my daughter.
I always was.</b>

544
00:26:37,359 --> 00:26:40,045
<b>Whenever you think
I'm not doing well,</b>

545
00:26:40,069 --> 00:26:43,045
<b>you always say I'm doing well
and that you're proud of me.</b>

546
00:26:43,069 --> 00:26:44,839
<b>That's how you got this far.</b>

547
00:26:45,069 --> 00:26:47,269
<b>I look into the future.</b>

548
00:26:50,009 --> 00:26:51,180
<b>Did you eat a lot?</b>

549
00:27:09,359 --> 00:27:10,636
<b>Mr. Song!</b>

550
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:12,029
<b>What's the matter?</b>

551
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:15,706
<b>Will you please do something
about the new kimbap place?</b>

552
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:18,269
<b>I can't do business
with their loud music.</b>

553
00:27:18,369 --> 00:27:19,845
<b>- The kimbap place?
- Yes!</b>

554
00:27:19,869 --> 00:27:22,045
<b>Okay. I'll go right over.</b>

555
00:27:22,069 --> 00:27:24,515
<b>Their opening is more like
a shaman's ritual.</b>

556
00:27:24,539 --> 00:27:25,740
<b>It's so noisy!</b>

557
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:28,880
<b>Oh, dear. Gosh, it's so noisy.</b>

558
00:27:30,349 --> 00:27:33,079
<b>Goodbye! Come by
for kimbap next time!</b>

559
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:35,920
<b>Excuse me. Just a moment.</b>

560
00:27:36,019 --> 00:27:39,366
<b>Yes? We open for business tomorrow.</b>

561
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:40,936
<b>It's not about that.</b>

562
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:44,075
<b>I'm the president
of the merchant association here.</b>

563
00:27:44,099 --> 00:27:45,575
<b>My name is Song Young Dal.</b>

564
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:48,376
<b>Oh, you're the president.
It's lovely to meet you.</b>

565
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,906
<b>Yes, hello.</b>

566
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:52,400
<b>I know that you're opening today,</b>

567
00:27:52,599 --> 00:27:55,515
<b>but people are complaining
about the loud music.</b>

568
00:27:55,539 --> 00:27:58,255
<b>Wait. I'm not the owner.</b>

569
00:27:58,279 --> 00:27:59,809
<b>- You're not?
- No.</b>

570
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:01,285
<b>Where is the owner?</b>

571
00:28:01,309 --> 00:28:03,549
<b>Ju Ri! What's the matter?</b>

572
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:14,859
<b>Cho Yeon.</b>

573
00:28:15,589 --> 00:28:17,335
<b>He's the association president.</b>

574
00:28:17,359 --> 00:28:18,676
<b>He has something to say.</b>

575
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:20,700
<b>Oh, Mr. President!</b>

576
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,476
<b>I was at your store to say hello.</b>

577
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,745
<b>Your wife is so beautiful.</b>

578
00:28:26,769 --> 00:28:29,569
<b>Sir, Mr. President,
you're a lucky man.</b>

579
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:31,485
<b>What do you have to say to me?</b>

580
00:28:31,509 --> 00:28:33,285
<b>Well, it's about...</b>

581
00:28:33,309 --> 00:28:37,126
<b>Sir, you're as handsome
as your wife is pretty.</b>

582
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:39,025
<b>You have such a nice nose.</b>

583
00:28:39,049 --> 00:28:41,896
<b>You could've been an actor.
Don't people say that?</b>

584
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:42,950
<b>Not really.</b>

585
00:28:43,759 --> 00:28:45,196
<b>It's great to meet you.</b>

586
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:47,666
<b>We're here now,
and I hope we get along.</b>

587
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:50,235
<b>Oh, dear, I'm sorry. I forgot.</b>

588
00:28:50,259 --> 00:28:51,706
<b>What did you want to say?</b>

589
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:54,146
<b>Yes, well, let me speak.</b>

590
00:28:54,170 --> 00:28:56,916
<b>I know that you opened today,</b>

591
00:28:56,940 --> 00:29:00,515
<b>but I got complaints
about your loud music.</b>

592
00:29:00,539 --> 00:29:02,416
<b>Could you turn it down?</b>

593
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:05,509
<b>You brat.
I told you it was too loud.</b>

594
00:29:05,809 --> 00:29:08,856
<b>I apologize.
We're used to working in...</b>

595
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,696
<b>spaces where the music is very loud.</b>

596
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,565
<b>- An occupational hazard.
- An occupational hazard.</b>

597
00:29:13,589 --> 00:29:17,095
<b>Sir. It's our opening day though.</b>

598
00:29:17,119 --> 00:29:18,420
<b>Could you let us off?</b>

599
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:21,235
<b>Well, I would like to,</b>

600
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:23,065
<b>but the others feel uncomfortable.</b>

601
00:29:23,089 --> 00:29:24,660
<b>Okay. I see, I see.</b>

602
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,259
<b>I get it.</b>

603
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:28,106
<b>I'll turn it down.</b>

604
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:29,575
<b>Don't worry, I'm good at that.</b>

605
00:29:29,599 --> 00:29:32,976
<b>- Is that for Unnie's Kimbap?
- Yes.</b>

606
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,440
<b>Line it up over there.</b>

607
00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:37,616
<b>Who is this from?</b>

608
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:40,156
<b>No, that side's too crowded.
Put that here.</b>

609
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:42,055
<b>- Over there? Okay.
- Put it there.</b>

610
00:29:42,079 --> 00:29:43,356
<b>Put it here, thanks.</b>

611
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:45,619

but you never do anything.</b>

767
00:36:36,829 --> 00:36:38,006
<b>Do it right now.</b>

768
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:40,436
<b>Can't you see I have customers?
I'll do it later.</b>

769
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:42,146
<b>No, do it right now!</b>

770
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:45,170
<b>I said I'll do it later,
you old man!</b>

771
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,679
<b>We'll do it right away.</b>

772
00:36:55,949 --> 00:36:58,325
<b>Plastics go together
and so do the cans.</b>

773

- Girls,</b>

00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:02,365
<b>open the door. He's leaving.</b>

775
00:37:02,389 --> 00:37:03,489
<b>Sure.</b>

776
00:37:07,690 --> 00:37:08,730
<b>Unbelievable!</b>

777
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,400
<b>Darn it.</b>

778
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,170
<b>You...</b>

779
00:37:21,139 --> 00:37:22,170
<b>Darn you!</b>

780
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:28,335
<b>When the police call,</b>

781
00:37:28,359 --> 00:37:32,059
<b>send over the medical reports
that I wrote via fax.</b>

782

<b>If the girl
needs to be hospitalized,</b>

783
00:37:34,029 --> 00:37:35,505
<b>we're the affiliated hospital,</b>

784
00:37:35,529 --> 00:37:37,405
<b>so tell the police we'll take her.</b>

785
00:37:37,429 --> 00:37:38,505
<b>Got it, Dr. Song.</b>

786
00:37:38,529 --> 00:37:40,849
<b>I'll take a 10-minute break
and go back to seeing patients.</b>

787
00:37:45,739 --> 00:37:47,480
<b>Nothing fazes her, does it?</b>

788
00:37:47,879 --> 00:37:50,079
<b>How can she be okay
after experiencing that?</b>

789
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:51,780
<b>Tell me about it.</b>

790
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:54,456
<b>My hands are still shaking.</b>

791
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,449
<b>How relentless.</b>

792
00:37:56,789 --> 00:37:57,789
<b>Exactly.</b>

793
00:38:01,259 --> 00:38:03,966
<b>Where's Dr. Song?</b>

794
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:06,159
<b>She went out that way just now...</b>

795
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:07,929
<b>for a 10-minute break.</b>

796
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,506
<b>How is she?</b>

797
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:13,670
<b>She isn't fazed at all.
You know how she is.</b>

798
00:38:13,799 --> 00:38:15,640
<b>I developed a crush on her now.</b>

799
00:38:57,549 --> 00:38:58,750
<b>Ta-da!</b>

800
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:05,019
<b>Unfazed? As if.</b>

801
00:39:06,819 --> 00:39:09,260
<b>She's just too proud

802
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:11,989
<b>(Wafer cookies, Coffee)</b>

803
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:17,469
<b>Is this too much?</b>

804
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:24,116
<b>I guess I can give her these
as a friend and colleague.</b>

805
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:25,209
<b>Yes, it's fine.</b>

806
00:39:31,379 --> 00:39:33,579
<b>- Gyu Jin?
- Bo Young?</b>

807
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:35,780
<b>It really is you.</b>

808
00:39:39,789 --> 00:39:41,689
<b>It's been so long.</b>

809
00:39:42,389 --> 00:39:44,629
<b>I think we last saw each other
10 years ago.</b>

810
00:39:45,129 --> 00:39:46,330
<b>I guess.</b>

811
00:39:47,129 --> 00:39:48,960
<b>How have you been?</b>

812
00:39:49,530 --> 00:39:50,629
<b>Good, I guess.</b>

813
00:39:51,069 --> 00:39:52,939
<b>I had a child
and have been raising him,</b>

814
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:54,800
<b>so things were busy.</b>

815
00:39:55,370 --> 00:39:57,669
<b>He was born with asthma, you see.</b>

816
00:39:58,509 --> 00:40:01,039
<b>Asthma isn't easy to care for.</b>

817
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:04,080
<b>Your husband should have
to help out a lot.</b>

818
00:40:04,810 --> 00:40:05,949
<b>Well...</b>

819
00:40:07,449 --> 00:40:08,650
<b>Are you still working?</b>

820
00:40:08,949 --> 00:40:12,719
<b>I run a small leather workshop
with a friend.</b>

821
00:40:13,389 --> 00:40:14,629
<b>You've been good though, right?</b>

822
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:16,330
<b>I heard that you got married,</b>

823
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,705
<b>but I couldn't make it
to the wedding.</b>

824
00:40:17,729 --> 00:40:19,205
<b>My son wasn't doing so well,
you see.</b>

825
00:40:19,229 --> 00:40:21,199
<b>I never made it to yours either.</b>

826
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:25,445
<b>Hold on. I don't think
I heard that you got married.</b>

827
00:40:25,469 --> 00:40:26,800
<b>You must've had a quiet wedding.</b>

828
00:40:29,669 --> 00:40:31,870
<b>Anyway, it's really
nice to meet you.</b>

829
00:40:34,810 --> 00:40:36,110
<b>Exactly.</b>

830
00:40:36,379 --> 00:40:39,086
<b>I can't believe we never
crossed paths before.</b>

831
00:40:39,110 --> 00:40:42,026
<b>Exactly. But then we meet here
of all places.</b>

832
00:40:42,050 --> 00:40:44,090
<b>(We fry your memories.)</b>

833
00:40:45,819 --> 00:40:48,990
<b>Don't laugh.
Why do you keep laughing?</b>

834
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:51,590
<b>What can I say? It's hilarious.</b>

835
00:40:53,129 --> 00:40:56,000
<b>She's one bold woman though.</b>

836
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:58,729
<b>You're never one to lose your cool,</b>

837
00:40:59,169 --> 00:41:01,969
<b>but she has you in a rage.</b>

838
00:41:02,169 --> 00:41:04,740
<b>I've never met a woman
like that before.</b>

839
00:41:05,069 --> 00:41:06,939
<b>You have no idea how brazen she is.</b>

840
00:41:07,310 --> 00:41:10,056
<b>Now I'm dead curious.</b>

841
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:13,250
<b>It takes a special kind of person
to make this kind of entrance.</b>

842
00:41:14,449 --> 00:41:16,650
<b>How old do you think she is?
Is she pretty?</b>

843
00:41:17,490 --> 00:41:18,490
<b>What?</b>

844
00:41:19,659 --> 00:41:22,235
<b>She sounds incredibly beautiful.</b>

845
00:41:22,259 --> 00:41:25,389
<b>Just like a rose
with prickly thorns.</b>

846
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,000
<b>A rose?</b>

847
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,560
<b>She's more like a rose
that's been squashed by a truck.</b>

848
00:41:29,870 --> 00:41:32,816
<b>If you're that curious,
go and see her for yourself.</b>

849
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,300
<b>Goodness.</b>

850
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,669
<b>I don't even know
how the day went by today.</b>

851
00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:40,485
<b>I should take a bath...</b>

852
00:41:40,509 --> 00:41:41,915
<b>before I get some sleep today.</b>

853
00:41:41,939 --> 00:41:44,110
<b>You're right. It was a long day.</b>

854
00:41:44,279 --> 00:41:46,326
<b>How many customers
did we have today?</b>

855
00:41:46,350 --> 00:41:50,266
<b>Can you believe
that president though?</b>

856
00:41:50,290 --> 00:41:51,750
<b>He looks petty too.</b>

857
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:53,259
<b>Cho Yeon, come on.</b>

858
00:41:53,790 --> 00:41:56,505
<b>You're the one
who said that he was...</b>

859
00:41:56,529 --> 00:41:58,005
<b>exceptionally handsome earlier.</b>

860
00:41:58,029 --> 00:42:00,399
<b>I was only trying to be nice.</b>

861
00:42:00,699 --> 00:42:02,305
<b>Handsome, my foot.</b>

862
00:42:02,329 --> 00:42:05,446
<b>What will you do
now that you're on his bad side?</b>

863
00:42:05,470 --> 00:42:07,115
<b>Won't he make it harder for us?</b>

864
00:42:07,139 --> 00:42:09,846
<b>We're not the only ones
on his bad side.</b>

865
00:42:09,870 --> 00:42:12,086
<b>He got on Cho Yeon's bad side too.</b>

866
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:14,156
<b>- Of course.
- You know who she is.</b>

867
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:15,415
<b>- Kang Cho Yeon.
- Kang Cho Yeon.</b>

868
00:42:15,439 --> 00:42:16,579
<b>Make way!</b>

869
00:42:18,050 --> 00:42:19,310
<b>Come on.</b>

870
00:42:22,019 --> 00:42:23,790
<b>Look at all these vegetables.</b>

871
00:42:24,550 --> 00:42:27,259
<b>There's spinach...
Gosh, I love shepherd's purse.</b>

872
00:42:27,519 --> 00:42:29,865
<b>- Is that so?
- I should buy some.</b>

873
00:42:29,889 --> 00:42:31,490
<b>But they don't seem fresh.</b>

874
00:42:31,990 --> 00:42:33,930
<b>I'll take all of these.</b>

875
00:42:34,199 --> 00:42:35,759
<b>Thank you.</b>

876
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:38,706
<b>Still, let me take this eggplant
for free.</b>

877
00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:40,170
<b>Of course. Take it with you.</b>

878
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:44,939
<b>Can someone give me 10 dollars?</b>

879
00:42:45,370 --> 00:42:46,740
<b>Gosh.</b>

880
00:42:47,079 --> 00:42:49,086
<b>I said we should go out
and get something nice to eat.</b>

881
00:42:49,110 --> 00:42:51,386
<b>Why do you always insist
on eating seaweed soup?</b>

882
00:42:51,410 --> 00:42:53,579
<b>We'll need to pay for another ticket
if we leave.</b>

883
00:42:53,819 --> 00:42:55,179
<b>Besides, this is more than enough.</b>

884
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:57,350
<b>So why aren't you eating up?
Go ahead.</b>

885
00:42:57,949 --> 00:42:59,089
<b>I'm eating.</b>

886
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:03,790
<b>Jong Soo, Jong Soo!</b>

887
00:43:04,189 --> 00:43:05,560
<b>What is it?</b>

888
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:09,930
<b>- Who's that?
- The body scrubber who works here.</b>

889
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,846
<b>There has been
a misunderstanding between us.</b>

890
00:43:12,870 --> 00:43:14,839
<b>What kind of misunderstanding?</b>

891
00:43:19,269 --> 00:43:21,956
<b>We scrubbed the backs
of some elders...</b>

892
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:23,209
<b>for two dollars per person,</b>

893
00:43:23,649 --> 00:43:25,709
<b>- but he caught us.
- What?</b>

894
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:28,579
<b>We scrubbed the back
of an elder this one time,</b>

895
00:43:28,750 --> 00:43:30,220
<b>and he gave us some money.</b>

896
00:43:31,389 --> 00:43:33,589
<b>We took it
because it was hard to refuse.</b>

897
00:43:34,959 --> 00:43:37,079
<b>I guess the rumor spread
about us being cheap labor...</b>

898
00:43:37,829 --> 00:43:39,206
<b>and that led to a lot of clients.</b>

899
00:43:39,230 --> 00:43:40,660
<b>I guess we're not so bad at this.</b>

900
00:43:40,959 --> 00:43:42,899
<b>Since you're here,
let us scrub your back.</b>

901
00:43:46,769 --> 00:43:47,769
<b>Guys,</b>

902
00:43:48,569 --> 00:43:50,069
<b>go back to Mr. Jang.</b>

903
00:43:50,439 --> 00:43:52,415
<b>- Joon Seon?
- What are you saying?</b>

904
00:43:52,439 --> 00:43:53,719
<b>I can't let you do this anymore.</b>

905
00:43:54,209 --> 00:43:56,379
<b>Your lives won't get better
if you stick with me.</b>

906
00:43:56,610 --> 00:43:58,449
<b>I don't have any money
or any connections.</b>

907
00:43:58,910 --> 00:44:00,456
<b>With Mr. Jang,</b>

908
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:02,720
<b>you can at least work as stuntmen.</b>

909
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:05,389
<b>- No way.
- I don't want that either.</b>

910
00:44:06,019 --> 00:44:08,120
<b>Don't just say that
and think about it.</b>

911
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:10,636
<b>You'll lose your touch
unless you keep training.</b>

912
00:44:10,660 --> 00:44:12,466
<b>We work out here, you know.</b>

913
00:44:12,490 --> 00:44:14,259
<b>We coordinate fight scenes as well.</b>

914
00:44:14,459 --> 00:44:16,675
<b>We've decided to follow you
wherever you go.</b>

915
00:44:16,699 --> 00:44:18,870
<b>Unbelievable.</b>

916
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:20,470
<b>Hey, do you know...</b>

917
00:44:21,569 --> 00:44:22,939
<b>(Auntie)</b>

918
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:30,949
<b>Yes, Auntie.
Can I call you back though? I...</b>

919
00:44:32,009 --> 00:44:33,019
<b>What?</b>

920
00:44:33,879 --> 00:44:34,920
<b>Really?</b>

921
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:44,266
<b>Gosh, you didn't have
to run over here.</b>

922
00:44:44,290 --> 00:44:45,930
<b>I was worried
that you'd change your mind.</b>

923
00:44:46,089 --> 00:44:49,000
<b>Are you sure about this?
Will you invest in my company?</b>

924
00:44:57,910 --> 00:44:59,009
<b>That's 20,000 dollars.</b>

925
00:44:59,709 --> 00:45:02,156
<b>I don't need it back any time soon,</b>

926
00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:04,449
<b>so set up your company
and pay me back when you can.</b>

927
00:45:06,110 --> 00:45:07,096
<b>Auntie...</b>

928
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:10,389
<b>Don't tell the family though.
Especially your mom.</b>

929
00:45:11,389 --> 00:45:13,396
<b>I don't want things
to be awkward between us.</b>

930
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:15,990
<b>Of course! I'm really grateful.</b>

931
00:45:16,259 --> 00:45:18,860
<b>My junior colleagues
are looking up to me,</b>

932
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:21,235
<b>so you really
saved my life with this.</b>

933
00:45:21,259 --> 00:45:23,699
<b>Gosh, there's no need
to put it like that.</b>

934
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,946
<b>Anyway, try your best.
This isn't just any money, you know.</b>

935
00:45:28,970 --> 00:45:30,569
<b>Of course. Don't I know it.</b>

936
00:45:30,939 --> 00:45:33,310
<b>You've been saving up
for your marriage, right?</b>

937
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:35,156
<b>I'll make my company a success...</b>

938
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:38,086
<b>and snag you a younger man
who you'll marry on a cruise ship.</b>

939
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:40,720
<b>Gosh, don't be silly.</b>

940
00:45:41,250 --> 00:45:42,925
<b>I get seasick, you know.</b>

941
00:45:42,949 --> 00:45:44,819
<b>Then you'll throw up
during the ceremony.</b>

942
00:45:45,290 --> 00:45:46,459
<b>I love you, Auntie.</b>

943
00:45:46,759 --> 00:45:49,136
<b>I love you, my dear investor.</b>

944
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:52,089
<b>Gosh, you're hurting me.</b>

945
00:45:52,490 --> 00:45:55,829
<b>Look at you with your sweaty palms.</b>

946
00:45:59,870 --> 00:46:01,769
<b>Yes, I gave him the money.</b>

947
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:05,570
<b>Judging by his big smile,
he must've been in a bad spot.</b>

948
00:46:06,539 --> 00:46:09,755
<b>Must you do this though instead
of giving it to him yourself?</b>

949
00:46:09,779 --> 00:46:13,720
<b>He needs to learn
not to be dependent on me.</b>

950
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:16,549
<b>You know how he is.</b>

951
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:19,820
<b>He's too kind for his own good
and bad at looking out for himself.</b>

952
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:21,566
<b>If he thinks
there's more money to spare,</b>

953
00:46:21,590 --> 00:46:23,206
<b>he won't take this seriously.</b>

954
00:46:23,230 --> 00:46:25,289
<b>You should at least
tell Ok Boon though.</b>

955
00:46:26,029 --> 00:46:29,105
<b>I feel guilty about lying to her.</b>

956
00:46:29,129 --> 00:46:30,700
<b>Your sister is the same.</b>

957
00:46:30,899 --> 00:46:34,539
<b>When it comes to her kids,
she can never be strict.</b>

958
00:46:35,669 --> 00:46:38,615
<b>We'll keep it between us for now.</b>

959
00:46:38,639 --> 00:46:41,556
<b>All right.
If that's what you insist...</b>

960
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:44,509
<b>Anyway, thank you for today.</b>

961
00:46:44,750 --> 00:46:47,019
<b>- I'll see you tomorrow. Bye.
- I'm home!</b>

962
00:46:47,450 --> 00:46:48,980
<b>Mom, I found an investor.</b>

963
00:46:49,019 --> 00:46:50,539
<b>Ga Hee,
someone invested in my company!</b>

964
00:46:51,149 --> 00:46:53,990
<b>I'm afraid you lost out
on a chance to make money.</b>

965
00:46:54,220 --> 00:46:56,706
<b>I offered it to you first
since you're family,</b>

966
00:46:56,730 --> 00:46:58,529
<b>but now I feel bad for you all.</b>

967
00:47:01,159 --> 00:47:03,429
<b>Look at you being
all boisterous again.</b>

968
00:47:04,129 --> 00:47:06,500
<b>I really wish
this works out for you.</b>

969
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:20,620
<b>Is she asleep?</b>

970
00:48:01,159 --> 00:48:03,360
<b>(Application for Hanseo Hospital)</b>

<b>(Coffee and tea)</b>

972
00:48:28,679 --> 00:48:30,019
<b>Ms. Song.</b>

973
00:48:32,289 --> 00:48:35,196
<b>Thank you for your hard work
as always.</b>

974
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:36,789
<b>It's almost time to close, right?</b>

975
00:48:37,659 --> 00:48:41,299
<b>I had lots of bags to carry earlier,
so I couldn't say hello.</b>

976
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:44,970
<b>Were you not stressed
about anything today?</b>

977
00:48:45,870 --> 00:48:48,716
<b>My mom is quite picky...</b>

978
00:48:48,740 --> 00:48:50,210
<b>and very moody.</b>

979
00:48:50,309 --> 00:48:52,710
<b>She's not easy to deal with, is she?</b>

980
00:48:56,039 --> 00:48:59,855
<b>Well... I just bought
a few cans of beer.</b>

981
00:48:59,879 --> 00:49:02,025
<b>If you want,
I can be your drinking buddy...</b>

982
00:49:02,049 --> 00:49:03,995
<b>just like last time.</b>

983
00:49:04,019 --> 00:49:05,450
<b>A drinking buddy.</b>

984
00:49:05,690 --> 00:49:08,120
<b>Gosh, Jae Seok. Watch your mouth.</b>

985
00:49:08,789 --> 00:49:09,966
<b>You said it wasn't you.</b>

986
00:49:09,990 --> 00:49:13,836
<b>You look just like her,
so I was mistaken again.</b>

987
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:16,399
<b>- And you have the same handwriting.
- Fine. It was me.</b>

988
00:49:16,769 --> 00:49:19,875
<b>I'm the pathetic loser who took
64 dollars from you at the cart bar.</b>

989
00:49:19,899 --> 00:49:22,615
<b>I didn't say you were pathetic.</b>

990
00:49:22,639 --> 00:49:25,885
<b>Right. I was so embarrassed
that I pretended not to know you.</b>

991
00:49:25,909 --> 00:49:28,485
<b>That night, it wouldn't
have been strange...</b>

992
00:49:28,509 --> 00:49:30,950
<b>for me to jump to my death
from somewhere.</b>

993
00:49:31,279 --> 00:49:33,025
<b>But I couldn't kill myself,</b>

994
00:49:33,049 --> 00:49:36,279
<b>so I got drunk with a stranger
whom I'd never meet again.</b>

995
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:39,990
<b>I was just so ashamed
that I made up a lie like that.</b>

996
00:49:40,259 --> 00:49:43,535
<b>Can't you just be nice
and pretend not to know it?</b>

997
00:49:43,559 --> 00:49:46,365
<b>Why do you keep mentioning it
and making fun of me like that?</b>

998
00:49:46,389 --> 00:49:47,735
<b>Do you really have to do that?</b>

999
00:49:47,759 --> 00:49:50,576
<b>Well... Ms. Song.
I didn't mean to make fun of you.</b>

1000
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:54,375
<b>All right. I'm a nasty drunk.
I snatched your money.</b>

1001
00:49:54,399 --> 00:49:56,785
<b>And I was actually impressed
by the phrase, "Just be myself".</b>

1002
00:49:56,809 --> 00:49:58,785
<b>So I decided to try my best again.</b>

1003
00:49:58,809 --> 00:50:00,379
<b>Are you happy now?</b>

1004
00:50:00,679 --> 00:50:01,679
<b>Ms. Song.</b>

1005
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:05,285
<b>Well... Ms. Song.
I just thought we had fun together.</b>

1006
00:50:05,309 --> 00:50:09,220
<b>I just did it because I was excited
to see you again.</b>

1007
00:50:09,679 --> 00:50:11,326
<b>I don't have a dollar bill.</b>

1008
00:50:11,350 --> 00:50:12,995
<b>I'll make sure to give you
the exact amount later.</b>

1009
00:50:13,019 --> 00:50:14,220
<b>So take this.</b>

1010
00:50:21,899 --> 00:50:23,299
<b>Wait, Ms. Song.</b>

1011
00:50:23,929 --> 00:50:25,100
<b>Well...</b>

1012
00:50:38,450 --> 00:50:41,279
<b>She keeps yelling at me without
giving me a chance to explain.</b>

1013
00:50:43,889 --> 00:50:45,190
<b>Was I being too mean?</b>

1014
00:50:46,889 --> 00:50:49,789
<b>I just feel really bad for her.</b>

1015
00:50:57,100 --> 00:50:58,976
<b>The radish soup is very refreshing.</b>

1016
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,015
<b>Is this all we have?</b>

1017
00:51:00,039 --> 00:51:02,015
<b>No, we have a lot.
You can have some more if you want.</b>

1018
00:51:02,039 --> 00:51:05,370
<b>You seem to have your appetite back
after getting the investment.</b>

1019
00:51:06,039 --> 00:51:07,556
<b>I heard the news, Joon Seon.</b>

1020
00:51:07,580 --> 00:51:10,086
<b>There will be two business owners
in our family now.</b>

1021
00:51:10,110 --> 00:51:11,385
<b>Congratulations.</b>

1022
00:51:11,409 --> 00:51:14,580
<b>That's right. Thank you, Da Hee.</b>

1023
00:51:15,549 --> 00:51:18,265
<b>So are you going to look around
for an office today?</b>

1024
00:51:18,289 --> 00:51:20,535
<b>Yes. I'll find an office
and have some business cards made...</b>

1025
00:51:20,559 --> 00:51:23,235
<b>to promote my business
to film and broadcasting companies.</b>

1026
00:51:23,259 --> 00:51:24,966
<b>I have a lot of work to do.</b>

1027
00:51:24,990 --> 00:51:26,936
<b>It's not easy
to run my own business.</b>

1028
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:29,806
<b>Of course not. It's never easy.</b>

1029
00:51:29,830 --> 00:51:33,100
<b>Stop making a fuss
as if everything's settled.</b>

1030
00:51:33,539 --> 00:51:37,309
<b>You have to be cautious
and weigh up what to do.</b>

1031
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:40,716
<b>Don't get carried away
and ruin things.</b>

1032
00:51:40,740 --> 00:51:42,080
<b>Gosh.</b>

1033
00:51:42,740 --> 00:51:46,186
<b>You know what he means.
He wants you to do things right.</b>

1034
00:51:46,210 --> 00:51:48,549
<b>I get it, Mom.
I know what Dad is like.</b>

1035
00:51:48,620 --> 00:51:51,426
<b>You two should just wait.
I'll let you shut down the store...</b>

1036
00:51:51,450 --> 00:51:53,370
<b>and travel all over the world
within three years.</b>

1037
00:51:53,490 --> 00:51:56,336
<b>Dad, you will play golf as a hobby.</b>

1038
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:57,936
<b>Mom, I'll get you a designer bag.</b>

1039
00:51:57,960 --> 00:51:59,230
<b>Dad, where are you going?</b>

1040
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:01,936
<b>Anyway, you'll take lessons
for arranging flowers...</b>

1041
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:03,206
<b>with a designer bag by your side.</b>

1042
00:52:03,230 --> 00:52:05,970
<b>Gosh, it sounds wonderful already.</b>

1043
00:52:06,669 --> 00:52:08,600
<b>All right, Da Hee.</b>

1044
00:52:08,639 --> 00:52:10,285
<b>Now that you're studying
for your future career,</b>

1045
00:52:10,309 --> 00:52:12,186
<b>you should go study abroad
for a language course.</b>

1046
00:52:12,210 --> 00:52:15,155
<b>Will you pay the tuition?
That would be great.</b>

1047
00:52:15,179 --> 00:52:16,779
<b>Joon Seon, what about me?</b>

1048
00:52:16,809 --> 00:52:19,385
<b>I just want you to get me
a small nail shop.</b>

1049
00:52:19,409 --> 00:52:21,249
<b>I'll let my employees work
and count the money.</b>

1050
00:52:21,419 --> 00:52:24,850
<b>A nail shop? Sure. It's no big deal.</b>

1051
00:52:24,950 --> 00:52:26,895
<b>Ji Hun, what do you want me to do?</b>

1052
00:52:26,919 --> 00:52:28,235
<b>Just tell me anything you want.</b>

1053
00:52:28,259 --> 00:52:30,360
<b>- Go ahead.
- I'm fine.</b>

1054
00:52:31,759 --> 00:52:32,860
<b>You're fine?</b>

1055
00:52:34,659 --> 00:52:38,005
<b>I knew it.
Ji Hun cares about me so much.</b>

1056
00:52:38,029 --> 00:52:40,570
<b>I'll go get ready for school.
Thank you for the breakfast.</b>

1057
00:52:43,970 --> 00:52:46,779
<b>Sometimes your son is
even scarier than Dad.</b>

1058
00:52:47,409 --> 00:52:48,480
<b>I feel the same way.</b>

1059
00:52:50,779 --> 00:52:52,226
<b>I guess it's Seo Jin.</b>

1060
00:52:52,250 --> 00:52:54,580
<b>Mom, stay here.
I'll go get the door.</b>

1061
00:52:55,019 --> 00:52:58,365
<b>You still look so sleepy, sweetie.</b>

1062
00:52:58,389 --> 00:52:59,789
<b>Gosh.</b>

1063
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:03,360
<b>She had a bellyache last night,

<b>Don't let her eat anything cold.
Make sure she drinks warm water.</b>

00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:09,830
<b>Is that true, Seo Jin?
Are you all right now?</b>

1066
00:53:10,830 --> 00:53:11,870
<b>Okay.</b>

1067
00:53:12,029 --> 00:53:14,546
<b>Da Hee will take care of her today.
I have important work to do.</b>

1068
00:53:14,570 --> 00:53:15,570
<b>Okay.</b>

1069
00:53:16,169 --> 00:53:19,645
<b>Seo Jin, have fun with your aunt.</b>

1070
00:53:19,669 --> 00:53:20,940
<b>I'll come home early.</b>

1071
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:24,125
<b>Bye.</b>

1072
00:53:24,149 --> 00:53:27,850
<b>Wait. Aren't you going to ask
what it is about?</b>

1073
00:53:28,750 --> 00:53:29,855
<b>Do I need to know?</b>

1074
00:53:29,879 --> 00:53:31,350
<b>Not really.</b>

1075
00:53:31,919 --> 00:53:34,620
<b>I'm going to look for an office.
I'm starting my own business.</b>

1076
00:53:34,789 --> 00:53:35,766
<b>Business?</b>

1077
00:53:35,790 --> 00:53:38,466
<b>Well... It's no big deal.</b>

1078
00:53:38,490 --> 00:53:39,960
<b>I'm starting a stunt company.</b>

1079
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:42,936
<b>I wanted to stay as an artist,</b>

1080
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:44,245
<b>but my junior stuntmen want it,</b>

1081
00:53:44,269 --> 00:53:45,706
<b>and I found an investor.</b>

1082
00:53:45,730 --> 00:53:48,716
<b>Really? Good for you.
I'll wish you good luck.</b>

1083
00:53:48,740 --> 00:53:52,070
<b>Sure. It will go well.
I'll do it right this time.</b>

1084
00:53:52,169 --> 00:53:53,710
<b>If you become a business owner,</b>

1085
00:53:53,879 --> 00:53:56,086
<b>are you not going
to do the stunt work yourself?</b>

1086
00:53:56,110 --> 00:53:57,149
<b>What?</b>

1087
00:53:57,750 --> 00:53:59,980
<b>Well... It's not like that.</b>

1088
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:03,966
<b>I'll invite you to the opening
of my business.</b>

1089
00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:05,620
<b>You have to come, okay?</b>

1090
00:54:06,919 --> 00:54:11,005
<b>Seo Jin, your mom doesn't
seem to hate the idea.</b>

1091
00:54:11,029 --> 00:54:12,259
<b>Right, Seo Jin?</b>

1092
00:54:17,570 --> 00:54:20,269
<b>He seems really excited about it.</b>

1093
00:54:22,169 --> 00:54:25,610
<b>That's better
than looking down though.</b>

1094
00:54:28,039 --> 00:54:29,139
<b>I like my hair.</b>

1095
00:54:30,039 --> 00:54:31,525
<b>- Ma'am.
- Yes?</b>

1096
00:54:31,549 --> 00:54:34,825
<b>Please make sure to give some volume
on top of my head.</b>

1097
00:54:34,849 --> 00:54:37,549
<b>The volume of my hair
represents my pride.</b>

1098
00:54:38,049 --> 00:54:39,089
<b>Okay.</b>

1099
00:54:40,190 --> 00:54:42,436
<b>Make it higher. Even higher.</b>

1100
00:54:42,460 --> 00:54:43,666
<b>- Higher?
- Yes.</b>

1101
00:54:43,690 --> 00:54:44,735
<b>- Higher?
- Higher.</b>

1102
00:54:44,759 --> 00:54:45,805
<b>- Even higher?
- Even higher.</b>

1103
00:54:45,829 --> 00:54:46,806
<b>- Even higher?
- Even higher.</b>

1104
00:54:46,830 --> 00:54:47,900
<b>Even higher than that?</b>

1105
00:54:48,559 --> 00:54:51,029
<b>Gosh, I love it. Are you guys done?</b>

1106
00:54:51,799 --> 00:54:52,869
<b>It's done.</b>

1107
00:54:53,430 --> 00:54:56,216
<b>- It's perfect.
- Okay. Ready to go to work.</b>

1108
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:57,485
<b>Let's go...</b>

1109
00:54:57,509 --> 00:54:59,245
<b>- and make kimbap.
- Make kimbap.</b>

1110
00:54:59,269 --> 00:55:01,109
<b>I just don't understand you.</b>

1111
00:55:01,710 --> 00:55:04,325
<b>He's not someone else's son,
you know.</b>

1112
00:55:04,349 --> 00:55:06,285
<b>Why do you pick
on every word he says?</b>

1113
00:55:06,309 --> 00:55:07,525
<b>What's wrong with you?</b>

1114
00:55:07,549 --> 00:55:09,319
<b>It's not like I was lying.</b>

1115
00:55:09,349 --> 00:55:10,765
<b>You shouldn't get your hopes up
too high.</b>

1116
00:55:10,789 --> 00:55:12,265
<b>It's not easy to run a business.</b>

1117
00:55:12,289 --> 00:55:14,265
<b>If things go wrong again,
he will just quit everything...</b>

1118
00:55:14,289 --> 00:55:16,735
<b>and curse his fate crying.</b>

1119
00:55:16,759 --> 00:55:17,960
<b>Forget it.</b>

1120
00:55:19,559 --> 00:55:22,206
<b>Maybe you know everything,
so you can be like that.</b>

1121
00:55:22,230 --> 00:55:23,500
<b>But I'm not like you.</b>

1122
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,206
<b>I will keep daydreaming
about traveling around the world...</b>

1123
00:55:26,230 --> 00:55:29,369
<b>and carrying a designer bag
with my children's money.</b>

1124
00:55:29,569 --> 00:55:32,269
<b>So you should stop
discouraging him like that.</b>

1125
00:55:32,970 --> 00:55:36,509
<b>Even a stranger has faith in him
and invested money in his business.</b>

1126
00:55:36,539 --> 00:55:39,650
<b>How could you act like that
as his dad? My gosh.</b>

1127
00:55:39,849 --> 00:55:41,150
<b>Where are you going?</b>

1128
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:43,025
<b>I'm going to buy pepper powder.</b>

1129
00:55:43,049 --> 00:55:45,349
<b>I will make kimchi for Na Hee. Why?</b>

1130
00:55:46,890 --> 00:55:50,589
<b>Gosh, why is she being so hostile?</b>

1131
00:55:51,359 --> 00:55:52,606
<b>My gosh.</b>

1132
00:55:52,630 --> 00:55:55,136
<b>Can you walk faster?
I'm starving now.</b>

1133
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:57,099
<b>My stomach hurts
because I'm walking too fast.</b>

1134
00:55:57,430 --> 00:55:58,545
<b>Are you that hungry?</b>

1135
00:55:58,569 --> 00:56:00,075
<b>Sure. You know what time it is now.</b>

1136
00:56:00,099 --> 00:56:01,575
<b>It's past mealtime.</b>

1137
00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:04,716
<b>You're so punctual
when it comes to eating.</b>

1138
00:56:04,740 --> 00:56:06,045
<b>- Ga Yeon, you know what?
- What?</b>

1139
00:56:06,069 --> 00:56:08,216
<b>When she just started
working at a bar,</b>

1140
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:10,656
<b>while other girls were busy
fixing their makeup,</b>

1141
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:14,119
<b>she just ate the lunch she brought
in the corner of the room.</b>

1142
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:15,750
<b>Really?</b>

1143
00:56:16,220 --> 00:56:17,866
<b>Hello, President Song.</b>

1144
00:56:17,890 --> 00:56:20,289
<b>- Hello, President Song.
- Hello.</b>

1145
00:56:20,490 --> 00:56:21,535
<b>So what happened?</b>

1146
00:56:21,559 --> 00:56:23,220
<b>Did you not get a scolding
from the owner?</b>

1147
00:56:23,259 --> 00:56:24,436
<b>I don't mind getting a scolding.</b>

1148
00:56:24,460 --> 00:56:27,099
<b>Whatever food they give you,
you will eat it deliciously.</b>

1149
00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:34,700
<b>Whatever food they give you,
you will eat it deliciously.</b>

1150
00:56:35,539 --> 00:56:38,646
<b>So you guys should
never skip a meal.</b>

1151
00:56:38,670 --> 00:56:41,279
<b>You feel empty
when you are hungry.</b>

1152
00:56:41,609 --> 00:56:43,755
<b>We just never get to feel hungry.</b>

1153
00:56:43,779 --> 00:56:46,585
<b>Right. We can't even go on a diet
because of you.</b>

1154
00:56:46,609 --> 00:56:48,156
<b>Cho Yeon.</b>

1155
00:56:48,180 --> 00:56:49,619
<b>Come with me.</b>

1156
00:57:09,670 --> 00:57:10,769
<b>Are you all right?</b>

1157
00:57:13,210 --> 00:57:16,140
<b>It's not like you're a warrior.
You're just fearless.</b>

1158
00:57:17,180 --> 00:57:19,726
<b>We have emergency
response procedures...</b>

1159
00:57:19,750 --> 00:57:21,626
<b>and safety regulations here.</b>

1160
00:57:21,650 --> 00:57:23,626
<b>Is this your first time as a doctor?
Are you an intern?</b>

1161
00:57:23,650 --> 00:57:24,966
<b>Mind your own business.</b>

1162
00:57:24,990 --> 00:57:26,926
<b>How could I think
of those regulations...</b>

1163
00:57:26,950 --> 00:57:28,420
<b>when a kid was shaking with fear?</b>

1164
00:57:32,230 --> 00:57:34,000
<b>Did the interview go well?</b>

1165
00:57:35,059 --> 00:57:36,936
<b>Well... It wasn't bad.</b>

1166
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:38,476
<b>Why would you say that?</b>

1167
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:39,606
<b>You should've aced it...</b>

1168
00:57:39,630 --> 00:57:41,476
<b>so at least one of us
can leave this place.</b>

1169
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:43,299
<b>I'll get a call and find out.</b>

1170
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:46,440
<b>By the way,</b>

1171
00:57:46,970 --> 00:57:50,116
<b>you have a patient called Si Hoo.</b>

<b>Yoo Si Hoo.</b>

00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:54,755
<b>He was admitted

1174

<b>Yes, so what?</b>

1175
00:57:55,849 --> 00:57:59,450
<b>He happens to be
the child of someone I know.</b>

1176
00:58:02,759 --> 00:58:05,990
<b>Take special care of him for me,

1177
00:58:06,359 --> 00:58:09,299
<b>I take care of my patients

1178
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:14,369
<b>How does he know the kid

1179
00:58:16,539 --> 00:58:20,880
<b>Yoo Si Hoo. Si Hoo...</b>

1180
00:58:23,140 --> 00:58:24,680
<b>(Madam Jang Ok Boon)</b>

1181
00:58:25,549 --> 00:58:26,650
<b>Hi, Mom.</b>

1182
00:58:26,910 --> 00:58:29,396
<b>Na Hee, are you with a patient?
Can we talk?</b>

1183
00:58:29,420 --> 00:58:30,896
<b>I can talk. What's up?</b>

1184
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:32,789
<b>Nothing's up.</b>

1185
00:58:33,289 --> 00:58:35,065
<b>When you came over for chicken,</b>

1186

<b>I noticed that Gyu Jin

<b>I'll make that

1188

<b>Pick it up on your way home.</b>

1189

<b>Forget it.</b>

1190
00:58:42,430 --> 00:58:45,106
<b>Why keep making kimchi
when you have a bad back?</b>

1191
00:58:45,130 --> 00:58:47,075
<b>I make it for you, of course.</b>

1192
00:58:47,099 --> 00:58:48,815
<b>Gyu Jin loves home-cooked food.</b>

<b>Forget it and forget about Gyu Jin.</b>

1194

<b>I'm too busy to come by,

<b>If you're busy today, then tomorrow.</b>

<b>I'm busy tomorrow too.

<b>Goodbye.</b>

1199

<b>Gyu Jin, Gyu Jin.

<b>She always refuses.</b>

1202
00:59:10,359 --> 00:59:12,430
<b>What? Did she refuse again?</b>

1203
00:59:12,660 --> 00:59:14,799
<b>Of course.
She's too busy to come by.</b>

1204
00:59:15,259 --> 00:59:17,845
<b>What now?
We already salted the vegetables.</b>

1205
00:59:17,869 --> 00:59:19,029
<b>I know.</b>

1206

<b>No.</b>

1208
00:59:43,319 --> 00:59:45,259
<b>I shouldn't read his diary.</b>

<b>It's private.</b>

00:59:55,799 --> 00:59:56,970
<b>Forget the privacy nonsense.</b>

1211
00:59:57,640 --> 01:00:00,440
<b>I should know. I'm his mom.</b>

1212

<b>Dad talked on the phone
