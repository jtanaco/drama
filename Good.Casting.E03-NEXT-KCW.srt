<b>150 million dollars.</b>

156

<b>Goodness. For a project that costs
over 200 million dollars,</b>

00:12:50,837 --> 00:12:53,567
<b>you get all the reports

158
00:12:53,807 --> 00:12:55,407
<b>Is this a secret nuclear experiment?</b>

159
00:12:55,407 --> 00:12:57,037
<b>The late chairman gave me...</b>

160
00:12:57,037 --> 00:12:59,106
<b>full authority to run
the research laboratory.</b>

161

<b>Everyone present is aware of that.</b>

162

<b>You just got back from
setting up a branch overseas,</b>

163

<b>and don't know
how things are done here.</b>

164
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:08,386
<b>You're right.</b>

165
00:13:08,587 --> 00:13:11,287
<b>If I'd known how irregular
the processes are here,</b>

166

<b>I'd have returned sooner

167

<b>That's what
the late chairman wanted.</b>

<b>Why are you mentioning my father?</b>

169

<b>something that's set before you.</b>

171
00:13:27,136 --> 00:13:29,136
<b>The late Chairman Yoon knew that...</b>

172
00:13:29,136 --> 00:13:31,807
<b>which is why he valued
and supported the research lab.</b>

173
00:13:32,476 --> 00:13:34,947
<b>That is how our company
could grow so large.</b>

174

<b>do you know how much
our shares jumped?</b>

179

<b>Five times.</b>

180

<b>The estimated profit is
4.7 billion dollars.</b>

181

<b>You alone helped to increase
the price of our shares,</b>

182

00:23:48,087 --> 00:23:49,386
<b>Hello?</b>

311
00:23:49,557 --> 00:23:51,896
<b>Can you hear me? Hello?</b>

312
00:23:52,196 --> 00:23:53,926
<b>Hello? Oh, no!</b>

313
00:23:56,297 --> 00:23:58,037
<b>No! No!</b>

314
00:24:15,087 --> 00:24:16,146
<b>Hello?</b>

315
00:24:17,116 --> 00:24:19,856
<b>Hello? Is anyone there?</b>

316
00:24:22,987 --> 00:24:25,727
<b>Can anyone help me?</b>

317
00:24:30,467 --> 00:24:32,467
<b>Ok Cheol hasn't done
anything suspicious.</b>

318
00:24:33,196 --> 00:24:34,767
<b>Do you think we made
the wrong guess?</b>

319
00:24:34,767 --> 00:24:37,277
<b>Maybe he already extracted the file.</b>

320
00:24:37,277 --> 00:24:38,307
<b>Then what should we do?</b>

321
00:24:38,307 --> 00:24:40,376
<b>What do you think?
We should stop the transaction.</b>

322
00:24:40,846 --> 00:24:41,876
<b>Here.</b>

323
00:24:42,307 --> 00:24:43,916
<b>I got it from CEO Yoon's computer.</b>

324
00:24:43,916 --> 00:24:44,977
<b>Have it copied as soon as possible.</b>

325
00:24:44,977 --> 00:24:46,446
<b>Without reporting it
to the director?</b>

326
00:24:46,916 --> 00:24:49,517
<b>That's why I'm telling you to hurry.
We need to give it to him.</b>

327
00:24:50,156 --> 00:24:51,186
<b>Okay, sir.</b>

328
00:24:51,557 --> 00:24:54,827
<b>But why haven't we heard
from the others yet?</b>

329
00:24:55,027 --> 00:24:56,757
<b>They should report to me
before they get off work.</b>

330
00:24:57,126 --> 00:24:58,456
<b>I haven't heard from Mi Soon...</b>

331
00:24:58,456 --> 00:25:00,797
<b>after she went inside the air vent.</b>

332
00:25:00,866 --> 00:25:02,327
<b>And you still haven't checked?</b>

333
00:25:05,436 --> 00:25:06,497
<b>Ms. Hwang?</b>

334
00:25:08,007 --> 00:25:10,337
<b>It's weird.
I think something happened.</b>

335
00:25:14,747 --> 00:25:16,507
<b>Find Mi Soon right now.</b>

336
00:25:18,416 --> 00:25:20,317
<b>They haven't forgotten about me,
have they?</b>

337
00:25:24,557 --> 00:25:26,257
<b>You guys.</b>

338
00:25:27,257 --> 00:25:30,396
<b>I'm still here.</b>

339
00:25:36,426 --> 00:25:39,337
<b>Hey, Rookie. Where did you get this?</b>

340
00:25:40,267 --> 00:25:42,166
<b>I couldn't find anything
in the security team.</b>

341
00:25:42,406 --> 00:25:44,176
<b>So I just hacked the system.</b>

342
00:25:45,477 --> 00:25:47,946
<b>The last time
we heard from Mi Soon...</b>

343
00:25:48,247 --> 00:25:50,116
<b>was at 9:56 a.m., right?</b>

344
00:25:54,747 --> 00:25:56,757
<b>It's about 340m
from Mr. Ok's office...</b>

345
00:25:56,757 --> 00:25:58,317
<b>to the air vent exit.</b>

346
00:25:58,656 --> 00:26:00,856
<b>And the fastest one can go
inside an air vent...</b>

347
00:26:00,856 --> 00:26:02,626
<b>is 0.5km per hour.</b>

348
00:26:03,227 --> 00:26:04,956
<b>If she moved at the fastest speed...</b>

349
00:26:04,956 --> 00:26:06,557
<b>starting from the moment
the security camera was installed,</b>

350
00:26:06,557 --> 00:26:08,027
<b>she should've arrived
at the connecting vent...</b>

351
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:09,227
<b>at about 10:34 a.m.</b>

352
00:26:09,767 --> 00:26:12,997
<b>But the passage is
only about 40 inches high.</b>

353
00:26:13,606 --> 00:26:14,767
<b>That's where she got stuck.</b>

354
00:26:17,007 --> 00:26:19,307
<b>Once everyone leaves
the research lab,</b>

355
00:26:19,507 --> 00:26:20,807
<b>they sterilize the place...</b>

356
00:26:20,807 --> 00:26:22,606
<b>by releasing sterilizing gas
every single hour.</b>

357
00:26:23,376 --> 00:26:24,747
<b>And that's about to start now,</b>

358
00:26:24,777 --> 00:26:26,146
<b>so we need to get her out of there
as soon as possible.</b>

359
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:29,146
<b>She's somewhere near here.</b>

360
00:26:30,116 --> 00:26:32,287
<b>We found where Mi Soon is.</b>

361
00:26:34,456 --> 00:26:37,227
<b>Okay. Now, it's my turn.</b>

362
00:26:48,537 --> 00:26:50,406
<b>- Won't it work?
- What's the matter with this?</b>

363
00:26:50,906 --> 00:26:52,037
<b>Wait.</b>

364
00:26:54,146 --> 00:26:55,547
<b>I'm calling from
the research department.</b>

365
00:26:55,846 --> 00:26:58,017
<b>We need you here because there's
a problem with the security system.</b>

366
00:26:58,217 --> 00:27:01,087
<b>Okay, we'll be right there.</b>

367
00:27:01,087 --> 00:27:02,116
<b>Okay, bye.</b>

368
00:27:03,517 --> 00:27:04,557
<b>Send the girls.</b>

369
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:06,217
<b>Okay, sir.</b>

370
00:27:30,817 --> 00:27:32,777
<b>Did you call the head office
to inspect an error...</b>

371
00:27:32,777 --> 00:27:34,146
<b>with the security system?</b>

372
00:27:34,146 --> 00:27:35,686
<b>I didn't know we had
female employees...</b>

373
00:27:35,717 --> 00:27:37,356
<b>in the digital security department.</b>

374
00:27:41,287 --> 00:27:42,386
<b>By any chance,</b>

375
00:27:42,956 --> 00:27:46,497
<b>when did you last update
the security system?</b>

376
00:27:47,196 --> 00:27:48,396
<b>Well...</b>

377
00:27:49,166 --> 00:27:50,567
<b>I think we did it last weekend.</b>

378
00:27:50,567 --> 00:27:52,067
<b>The biometric
authentication system...</b>

379
00:27:52,067 --> 00:27:53,866
<b>shoots structured light
into an infrared sensor.</b>

380
00:27:53,866 --> 00:27:55,136
<b>So every time light
goes into the sensor,</b>

381
00:27:55,166 --> 00:27:56,807
<b>it saves even the smallest
additional changes.</b>

382
00:27:56,837 --> 00:27:58,977
<b>Therefore, you're obligated
to check the server...</b>

383
00:27:58,977 --> 00:28:01,507
<b>when the access rate
increases by 20 percent.</b>

384
00:28:02,277 --> 00:28:03,376
<b>Didn't you check?</b>

385
00:28:05,017 --> 00:28:06,146
<b>Well...</b>

386
00:28:06,577 --> 00:28:08,487
<b>Everything was fine
even if we didn't check.</b>

387
00:28:08,487 --> 00:28:10,047
<b>I'm sure you were told...</b>

388
00:28:10,047 --> 00:28:13,087
<b>that it'll cost at least
tens of thousands of dollars...</b>

389
00:28:13,087 --> 00:28:15,527
<b>if the projector is damaged...</b>

390
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:17,426
<b>due to repeated errors
in the illuminator.</b>

391
00:28:19,596 --> 00:28:21,997
<b>Then you should go ahead and check.</b>

392
00:28:29,366 --> 00:28:30,477
<b>Go ahead.</b>

393
00:28:41,487 --> 00:28:43,987
<b>I'm only asking you to go because
you'll find her faster than me.</b>

394
00:28:44,956 --> 00:28:46,017
<b>But be careful.</b>

395
00:28:46,017 --> 00:28:47,787
<b>If I don't get out of there
by 6 p.m.,</b>

396
00:28:47,787 --> 00:28:49,787
<b>find the reboot button and press it.</b>

397
00:28:50,087 --> 00:28:51,797
<b>That will ventilate the gas.</b>

398
00:28:51,797 --> 00:28:53,356
<b>6 p.m. The reboot button.</b>

399
00:28:53,356 --> 00:28:55,126
<b>It's a red button.</b>

400
00:28:55,126 --> 00:28:56,196
<b>Red.</b>

401
00:28:58,567 --> 00:29:00,936
<b>6 p.m. The reboot button. Red.</b>

402
00:29:14,817 --> 00:29:16,416
<b>Mi Soon.</b>

403
00:29:34,436 --> 00:29:35,737
<b>It's a red button.</b>

404
00:29:37,577 --> 00:29:39,206
<b>Darn it.</b>

405
00:29:40,206 --> 00:29:41,346
<b>What is this?</b>

406
00:29:43,846 --> 00:29:45,477
<b>Mi Soon.</b>

407
00:29:51,856 --> 00:29:53,057
<b>What should I do?</b>

408
00:30:02,767 --> 00:30:06,567
<i><b>Eeny, meeny, miny, moe</i></b>

409
00:30:08,106 --> 00:30:10,376
<i><b>Catch a tiger by the toe</i></b>

410
00:30:10,376 --> 00:30:11,807
<i><b>If he hollers, let him go</i></b>

411
00:30:11,876 --> 00:30:13,747
<i><b>Eeny, meeny, miny, moe</i></b>

412
00:30:42,967 --> 00:30:45,807
<b>- Mi Soon.
- Is anyone there?</b>

413
00:30:46,537 --> 00:30:47,906
<b>Hello?</b>

414
00:30:49,007 --> 00:30:51,247
<b>- Hello?
- Mi Soon?</b>

415
00:30:57,416 --> 00:30:59,557
<b>Is someone there?</b>

416
00:30:59,916 --> 00:31:01,287
<b>Mi Soon, is that you?</b>

417
00:31:01,287 --> 00:31:03,426
<b>Yes, it's me. Please...</b>

418
00:31:03,426 --> 00:31:04,497
<b>Mi Soon.</b>

419
00:31:07,596 --> 00:31:10,096
<b>Can you please
get me out of here?</b>

420
00:31:10,096 --> 00:31:11,967
<b>Why are you stuck here?</b>

421
00:31:12,737 --> 00:31:15,136
<b>- Mi Soon.
- Get me out.</b>

422
00:31:15,136 --> 00:31:16,436
<b>Hang in there.</b>

423
00:31:16,807 --> 00:31:17,837
<b>I will...</b>

424
00:31:27,416 --> 00:31:28,817
<b>- Mi Soon.
- What?</b>

425
00:31:29,087 --> 00:31:30,247
<b>I'm sorry, but...</b>

426
00:31:31,017 --> 00:31:33,087
<b>can you curl up a bit more?</b>

427
00:31:33,356 --> 00:31:35,626
<b>It's not easy to change my posture.</b>

428
00:31:35,626 --> 00:31:37,696
<b>Wait. Let me try.</b>

429
00:31:55,346 --> 00:31:56,977
<b>Is that the Maintenance Team?</b>

430
00:31:57,146 --> 00:31:59,446
<b>I think our ventilation system
is infested.</b>

431
00:31:59,777 --> 00:32:01,886
<b>Isn't it time you gassed it?</b>

432
00:32:24,906 --> 00:32:26,706
<b>Pull, pull. Pull hard.</b>

433
00:32:32,176 --> 00:32:33,277
<b>I'm out.</b>

434
00:32:40,017 --> 00:32:41,886
<b>Insecticide gas is released.</b>

435
00:32:42,227 --> 00:32:44,057
<b>Insecticide gas is released.</b>

436
00:32:44,656 --> 00:32:48,126
<b>We released insecticide gas
to clean the research lab.</b>

437
00:32:48,366 --> 00:32:50,467
<b>There will be a loud noise

438

<b>Please understand.</b>

439
00:32:54,136 --> 00:32:55,906
<b>I'm out at last.</b>

440

<b>Are all my bones okay?</b>

441
00:32:59,706 --> 00:33:00,706
<b>Am I okay?</b>

442
00:33:00,706 --> 00:33:02,446
<b>You seem to be fine.</b>

443
00:33:02,706 --> 00:33:04,517
<b>Can you crawl out of here?</b>

444
00:33:05,376 --> 00:33:06,376
<b>Yes.</b>

445
00:33:08,946 --> 00:33:10,247
<b>What? What's wrong?</b>

446
00:33:10,247 --> 00:33:11,956
<b>My leg. It's cramped.</b>

447
00:33:11,956 --> 00:33:14,686
<b>What is cramped? Where?</b>

448
00:33:14,926 --> 00:33:16,386
<b>No, not there.</b>

449
00:33:16,386 --> 00:33:18,956
<b>My leg. My leg.</b>

450
00:33:19,596 --> 00:33:21,166
<b>Your leg?</b>

451
00:33:27,567 --> 00:33:30,106
<b>What is that smoke?</b>

452
00:33:30,636 --> 00:33:32,906
<b>Doesn't it smell poisonous?</b>

453
00:33:42,017 --> 00:33:43,017
<b>The gas!</b>

454
00:33:43,017 --> 00:33:44,916
<b>Let's run. Go that way.</b>

455
00:33:44,916 --> 00:33:46,386
<b>Hurry. Move it.</b>

456
00:33:48,087 --> 00:33:49,327
<b>Move quickly.</b>

457
00:33:49,327 --> 00:33:51,057
<b>I hate gas more than anything.</b>

458
00:33:51,057 --> 00:33:53,596
<b>Hurry! Move fast!</b>

459
00:34:02,467 --> 00:34:03,507
<b>Darn it.</b>

460
00:34:19,887 --> 00:34:21,056
<b>Is there a problem?</b>

461
00:34:21,826 --> 00:34:23,527
<b>Oh, no.</b>

462
00:34:24,056 --> 00:34:25,226
<b>It's all fine.</b>

463
00:34:25,726 --> 00:34:26,797
<b>Okay.</b>

464
00:34:58,496 --> 00:34:59,556
<b>Let's go.</b>

465
00:35:05,837 --> 00:35:08,007
<b>Wait. Just a moment!</b>

466

<b>after failing to capture Michael
three years ago.</b>

777
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:53,379
<b>One of her junior agents
Kwon Min Seok...</b>

778
00:59:53,379 --> 00:59:54,750
<b>died during the operation.</b>

779
01:00:30,379 --> 01:00:32,279
<b>(Epilogue)</b>

780
01:00:34,649 --> 01:00:36,489
<b>How did it go with CEO Yoon?</b>

781
01:00:36,689 --> 01:00:37,689
<b>What?</b>

782
01:00:38,089 --> 01:00:40,330
<b>How is he in person?</b>

783
01:00:40,430 --> 01:00:41,859
<b>Handsome, right?</b>

784
01:00:41,859 --> 01:00:43,129
<b>Right, well...</b>

785
01:00:44,660 --> 01:00:46,600
<b>So it's protocol...</b>

786
01:00:47,069 --> 01:00:49,669
<b>to report anyone we have
a personal connection to.</b>

787
01:00:49,669 --> 01:00:51,870
<b>That's right. Did you cross paths
with someone you know?</b>

788
01:00:52,810 --> 01:00:53,839
<b>Well...</b>

789
01:00:53,839 --> 01:00:56,879
<b>If CEO Yoon was my mark,
I would've charmed...</b>

790
01:00:56,879 --> 01:00:58,640
<b>the pants off him.</b>

791
01:01:01,210 --> 01:01:02,649
<b>Did the gas get to your head?</b>

792
01:01:03,649 --> 01:01:05,450
<b>You think I can't do it?</b>

793
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:08,290
<b>I was the famous
Catherine Hwang, you know.</b>

794
01:01:08,290 --> 01:01:09,489
<b>Didn't you know that?</b>

795
01:01:09,489 --> 01:01:10,759
<b>What about your husband?</b>

796
01:01:11,189 --> 01:01:12,859
<b>I'm just saying, you know.</b>

797
01:01:13,629 --> 01:01:15,230
<b>All I do is...</b>

798
01:01:15,230 --> 01:01:17,000
<b>clean restrooms and sweep floors.</b>

799
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,200
<b>I wouldn't mind...</b>

800
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:19,870
<b>a little eye candy.</b>

801
01:01:20,029 --> 01:01:21,100
<b>You know,</b>

802
01:01:22,100 --> 01:01:25,140
<b>I should've been the one
to play his assistant.</b>

803
01:01:25,140 --> 01:01:26,509
<b>See? She's interested in him too.</b>

804
01:01:26,509 --> 01:01:27,739
<b>Right?</b>

805
01:01:27,739 --> 01:01:30,779
<b>That's not what I mean.
Anyone can tell...</b>

806
01:01:30,779 --> 01:01:33,410
<b>that Kang Woo Won isn't the culprit.</b>

807
01:01:33,549 --> 01:01:35,750
<b>He's just not capable...</b>

808
01:01:35,750 --> 01:01:38,250
<b>of planning an intricate crime.</b>

809
01:01:38,250 --> 01:01:39,319
<b>Are you saying...</b>

810
01:01:39,790 --> 01:01:42,759
<b>that Yoon Seok Ho is capable
since he's smart?</b>

811
01:01:44,390 --> 01:01:45,819
<b>Not exactly,</b>

812
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:48,160
<b>but he does have
the highest level of education.</b>

813
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:50,430
<b>Don't you know that
anyone can look suspicious...</b>

814
01:01:50,430 --> 01:01:51,660
<b>if you watch them...</b>

815
01:01:51,660 --> 01:01:53,469
<b>while considering them as suspects?</b>

816
01:01:53,469 --> 01:01:56,069
<b>Why are you suddenly
getting all serious?</b>

817
01:01:57,100 --> 01:01:59,100
<b>I'm just saying...</b>

818
01:02:00,069 --> 01:02:01,270
<b>that Kang Woo Won...</b>

819
01:02:01,939 --> 01:02:03,779
<b>can be the culprit.</b>

820
01:02:04,009 --> 01:02:06,410
<b>Your mark is
a globally famous celebrity...</b>

821
01:02:06,779 --> 01:02:09,410
<b>while yours is a rich CEO.</b>

822
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:11,879
<b>I don't get what
you're complaining about.</b>

823
01:02:13,250 --> 01:02:15,189
<b>So what were you
about to say just now?</b>

824
01:02:15,189 --> 01:02:16,259
<b>What?</b>

825
01:02:17,790 --> 01:02:18,819
<b>It's nothing.</b>

826
01:02:19,290 --> 01:02:20,930
<b>It sounded important.</b>

827
01:02:20,930 --> 01:02:22,660
<b>She asked about protocol...</b>

828
01:02:22,660 --> 01:02:25,129
<b>Can you get me
Kang Woo Won's autograph?</b>

829
01:02:25,129 --> 01:02:26,870
<b>My daughter loves the kid.</b>

830
01:02:26,870 --> 01:02:28,899
<b>I'll at least ask.</b>

831
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:30,069
<b>Really?</b>

832
01:02:30,069 --> 01:02:31,870
<b>Let me get you a piece of paper.</b>

833
01:02:31,870 --> 01:02:33,009
<b>Where can I find one?</b>

834
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:37,040
<b>Gosh.</b>

835
01:02:39,439 --> 01:02:41,310
<b>(Good Casting)</b>

836
01:02:41,310 --> 01:02:43,719
<b>She's your new English tutor.</b>

837
01:02:43,719 --> 01:02:45,580
<b>I hope we get along, Seok Ho.</b>

838
01:02:45,580 --> 01:02:46,790
<b>Once you enter Kang Woo Won's house,</b>

839
01:02:46,790 --> 01:02:48,520
<b>observe where
the security cameras are.</b>

840
01:02:49,089 --> 01:02:50,989
<b>She's the worst kind ever.</b>

841
01:02:50,989 --> 01:02:52,620
<b>Chief Tak may be Michael.</b>

842
01:02:52,620 --> 01:02:54,689
<b>Get me any viable evidence.</b>

843
01:02:54,689 --> 01:02:56,529
<b>Five minutes is more than enough.
Let's go.</b>

844
01:02:56,529 --> 01:02:57,730
<b>- I'm sorry, but you can't enter.
- Me?</b>

845
01:02:57,730 --> 01:02:59,100
<b>Get him before he runs off.</b>

846
01:02:59,100 --> 01:03:00,330
<b>Get her!</b>

847
01:03:02,129 --> 01:03:04,739
<b>Chan Mi, Mi Soon, hurry!</b>

848
01:03:05,140 --> 01:03:07,969
<b>If Michael is here, leave him to me.</b>

849
01:03:10,580 --> 01:03:11,680
<b>Consider this...</b>

850
01:03:12,779 --> 01:03:13,950
<b>your last day.</b>
