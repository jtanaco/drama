<b>He's a worker at a security company</b>

160

<b>I had requested to find Yu-jin.</b>

161

<b>What?</b>

162
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:14,519
<b>Why did he...</b>

163
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,885
<b>I guess he had another client.</b>

164

<b>The conditions to kill her</b>

165
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:21,955

<b>Can you think of someone

199

<b>Let's go.</b>

636

<b>- Let's head inside.

<b>Officer Jo?</b>

642
01:00:23,750 --> 01:00:26,079
<b>I just got a call
from National Forensic Service</b>

643

<b>and the blood found

<b>[ matches with Oh Jung-tae's DNA, ]</b>

<b>[ the man who was caught
in front of your house. ]</b>

<b>That means</b>

647
01:00:35,660 --> 01:00:39,199
<b>that Mr. Jin, Mr. Park's senior,</b>

648

<b>and Jung-tae are on one team.</b>

649

<b>[ I found it out. ]</b>

650
01:00:44,270 --> 01:00:46,435
<b>- Mr. Jin?
[ - Yes! ]</b>

651
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:50,105
<b>I've requested the police in Seoul

652
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:52,905

<b>[ Donghan ]</b>

654

<b>[ What do you mean? ]</b>

<b>[ There's a broadcasting company here

<b>Who called them?</b>

657
01:01:02,550 --> 01:01:06,785
<b>I asked about it,
and apparently, Ms. Han did.</b>

658
01:01:17,330 --> 01:01:19,465
<b>What is happening?</b>

659
01:01:19,870 --> 01:01:20,995
<b>Things aren't looking good.</b>

660

<b>Chairman Louis is coming from France</b>

661

<b>and he called a broadcasting company
to the boutique.</b>

662
01:01:30,310 --> 01:01:34,445
<b>But the bigger issue is
that there are two outfits</b>

663
01:01:35,220 --> 01:01:36,485
<b>being displayed for the opening.</b>

664

<b>Well,</b>

666
01:01:40,820 --> 01:01:44,685
<b>the reason Sun-young called
Chairman Louis here is...</b>

667
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:50,969
<b>- Find a way to stop him from coming.
- But there's no way.</b>

668
01:01:50,970 --> 01:01:53,195
<b>Find a way no matter what!</b>

669
01:01:58,610 --> 01:02:00,405
<b>Figure out how we can contact Louis.</b>

670

<b>Yes, sir. Yes.</b>
