<b>But you know...</b>

793
01:06:05,190 --> 01:06:07,060
<b>that I was also with another man.</b>

794
01:06:07,060 --> 01:06:09,090
<b>Don't think of it so seriously.</b>

795
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:11,020
<b>They say there are people...</b>

796
01:06:11,270 --> 01:06:14,190
<b>that end up with each other no matter what.</b>

797
01:06:15,570 --> 01:06:17,630
<b>When did that black car start tailing us?</b>

798
01:06:17,630 --> 01:06:19,310
<b>What I'm most afraid of...</b>

799
01:06:19,540 --> 01:06:21,810
<b>is having him break down because of me.</b>

800
01:06:22,310 --> 01:06:24,480
<b>That's why I decided to avoid what I fear the most.</b>
