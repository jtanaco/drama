<b>(Episode 21)</b>

2
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:21,449
<b>It might sound crazy,</b>

3
00:00:22,349 --> 00:00:24,160
<b>but I'll do everything I can...</b>

4
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:26,890
<b>to not see you lying here.</b>

5
00:00:30,629 --> 00:00:32,800
<b>- Sun Ho.
- It's Detective Park Sun Ho...</b>

6
00:00:33,269 --> 00:00:34,276
<b>What?</b>

7
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:35,730
<b>Whom you had saved.</b>

8
00:00:37,839 --> 00:00:39,240
<b>He's the culprit.</b>

9
00:00:44,539 --> 00:00:46,750
<b>If you die like this, I'll kill you.</b>

10
00:00:47,479 --> 00:00:48,609
<b>Hyeong Ju.</b>

11
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:52,020
<b>I seriously won't die.</b>

12
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:25,379
<b>Hey, Ga Hyeon.</b>

13
00:01:28,219 --> 00:01:31,359
<b>What brings you here without a call?</b>

14
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:33,989
<b>I got worried
after what you said on the phone.</b>

15
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,560
<b>I heard you met Ms. Lee.</b>

16
00:01:36,489 --> 00:01:37,560
<b>Right.</b>

17
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:39,829
<b>I'm fine.</b>

18
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:42,406
<b>I wasn't really expecting anything.</b>

19
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:43,739
<b>I see.</b>

20
00:01:44,569 --> 00:01:47,069
<b>It would've been better
if she remembered anything.</b>

21
00:01:49,069 --> 00:01:50,209
<b>You're right.</b>

22
00:01:50,709 --> 00:01:51,709
<b>Yes.</b>

23
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:55,680
<b>Okay, then. Go in and get some rest.</b>

24
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,480
<b>Bye.</b>

25
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,770
<b>How could you believe...</b>

26
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,909
<b>what I told you that easily?</b>

27
00:02:54,139 --> 00:02:56,409
<b>That we were killed
by a serial killer.</b>

28
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:59,979
<b>There's no definite evidence.
But why did you believe me?</b>

29
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,759
<b>Hyeong Ju.</b>

30
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:15,360
<b>Sun Ho wasn't here, was he?</b>

31
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,099
<b>Did he contact you in any way?</b>

32
00:03:19,629 --> 00:03:20,800
<b>I...</b>

33
00:03:22,229 --> 00:03:23,740
<b>I brought him here.</b>

34
00:03:23,939 --> 00:03:25,539
<b>Ga Hyeon, are you okay?</b>

35
00:03:27,139 --> 00:03:28,370
<b>Hyeong Ju.</b>

36
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:32,710
<b>I'm all right.</b>

37
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:39,949
<b>You were right.</b>

38
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:43,990
<b>Sun Ho...</b>

39
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:49,860
<b>Sun Ho...</b>

40
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:55,430
<b>killed those people.</b>

41
00:04:52,689 --> 00:04:56,389
<b>It's not too late for us
to right the wrongs.</b>

42
00:04:57,529 --> 00:04:59,399
<b>You're still a detective.</b>

43
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:01,100
<b>It's way too early to give up.</b>

44
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:04,240
<b>Do you also think...</b>

45
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:07,146
<b>Hyeong Ju is the culprit?</b>

46
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:09,985
<b>I trust him
no matter what anyone says.</b>

47
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:11,779
<b>Hyeong Ju said...</b>

48
00:05:11,939 --> 00:05:14,910
<b>the culprit seems like
someone who knows him.</b>

49
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:19,480
<b>How can he...</b>

50
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,420
<b>How?</b>

51
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:23,920
<b>It's because of me.</b>

52
00:05:24,019 --> 00:05:26,160
<b>Your life is also in danger
because of me.</b>

53
00:05:33,029 --> 00:05:35,529
<b>So this is why I end up killing you.</b>

54
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:15,569
<b>So everything was planned?</b>

55
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:17,410
<b>All these people died...</b>

56
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:22,009
<b>because I brought him back to life?</b>

57
00:06:33,089 --> 00:06:34,360
<b>Corporal Jin Sa Kyung.</b>

58
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,459
<b>Where's Detective Ji Hyeong Ju
right now?</b>

59
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,370
<b>We're doing our best
to look for him too.</b>

60
00:06:42,829 --> 00:06:45,569
<b>You know this isn't the time
to show your comradeship, don't you?</b>

61
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,470
<b>You're getting married next month.</b>

62
00:06:47,709 --> 00:06:50,389
<b>What did you and the captain of
Regional Investigation Unit discuss?</b>

63
00:06:55,149 --> 00:06:57,180
<b>You didn't tell him
where Hyeong Ju is, did you?</b>

64
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:58,819
<b>Hey, Soon Woo.</b>

65
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:01,550
<b>We're obviously
helping a criminal take shelter.</b>

66
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:03,526
<b>We're detectives,</b>

67
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:05,660
<b>and this won't end
with a simple disciplinary action.</b>

68
00:07:05,889 --> 00:07:07,060
<b>So that's why...</b>

69
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:09,629
<b>you told Captain Jung everything?</b>

70
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:13,699
<b>I know...</b>

71
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,129
<b>where Ji Hyeong Ju is.</b>

72
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:21,439
<b>I thought you should know
before Captain Jung does.</b>

73
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:24,910
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

74
00:07:33,649 --> 00:07:35,350
<b>- Yes?
- Captain Heo.</b>

75
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:36,649
<b>This is Hyeong Ju.</b>

76
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:47,870
<b>I couldn't wrap my head around
some things you said.</b>

77
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:54,139
<b>Did you really save
each one of those people...</b>

78
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:55,839
<b>to reset?</b>

79
00:07:58,410 --> 00:07:59,740
<b>"Reset"?</b>

80
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:03,310
<b>I'm not sure
what you're referring to.</b>

81
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,180
<b>Hyeong Ju told me already.</b>

82
00:08:07,149 --> 00:08:08,795
<b>That he came back a year...</b>

83
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:11,589
<b>from the future along with you.</b>

84
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:13,189
<b>Detective Ji said that?</b>

85
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:20,000
<b>I have a good imagination,
so it wasn't that hard to believe.</b>

86
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,569
<b>By any chance,</b>

87
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,170
<b>did he tell you the reason...</b>

88
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:31,716
<b>behind his decision to reset?</b>

89
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:32,939
<b>"The reason"?</b>

90
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:35,810
<b>It was a very important reason.</b>

91
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:39,149
<b>It's something
you'd be interested in too.</b>

92
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,389
<b>What I am interested in is...</b>

93
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:49,690
<b>the fact that
everyone who reset with Hyeong Ju...</b>

94
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:54,230
<b>doesn't seem to be irrelevant to me.</b>

95
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:02,110
<b>So that's why I have a feeling...</b>

96
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:04,909
<b>that you may know
what my future holds.</b>

97
00:09:07,149 --> 00:09:08,879
<b>The future?</b>

98
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,149
<b>From my experience,</b>

99
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:14,620
<b>there was no one
who overcame their destined death.</b>

100
00:09:15,549 --> 00:09:16,990
<b>Not even one.</b>

101
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:19,559
<b>That means...</b>

102
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:25,399
<b>you'll be safe...</b>

103
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:28,799
<b>until everyone else dies.</b>

104
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,470
<b>That's all I know.</b>

105
00:09:38,139 --> 00:09:40,610
<b>Right, one more thing.</b>

106
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,019
<b>What is this?</b>

107
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:53,720
<b>Let's call this your fate.</b>

108
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:55,730
<b>You'll find out soon.</b>

109
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:03,769
<b>It always happened.</b>

110
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:18,580
<b>Do you think it'll work?</b>

111
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,889
<b>I'll have to try.</b>

112
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:25,990
<b>I have no other choice.</b>

113
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:30,559
<b>Perhaps,</b>

114
00:10:32,129 --> 00:10:35,169
<b>this could be why
we went through with the reset.</b>

115
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:37,870
<b>Perhaps,</b>

116
00:10:39,169 --> 00:10:41,710
<b>this had to happen.</b>

117
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:51,750
<b>There was no one
who overcame their destined death.</b>

118
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:55,549
<b>Not even one.</b>

119
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:34,759
<b>Hyeong Ju.</b>

120
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,389
<b>Stop.</b>

121
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:08,860
<b>Stop.</b>

122
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:10,899
<b>Detective Ji.</b>

123
00:12:55,669 --> 00:12:57,909
<b>Maru, let's eat.</b>

124
00:12:58,139 --> 00:12:59,610
<b>Come here.</b>

125
00:13:02,379 --> 00:13:03,909
<b>Let's go for a walk.</b>

126
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:08,950
<b>Darn it.</b>

127
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:17,759
<b>Hey, Soon Woo.</b>

128
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,600
<b>What?</b>

129
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:23,399
<b>Hey, what's going on?</b>

130
00:13:24,769 --> 00:13:26,700
<b>I have no idea.</b>

131
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,309
<b>Did he not tell you anything either?</b>

132
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:30,855
<b>He was determined to catch
the real culprit,</b>

133
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:32,080
<b>so why did he turn himself in?</b>

134
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,049
<b>Did he really do it?</b>

135
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:19,149
<b>You took those photos, didn't you?</b>

136
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:29,360
<b>Mr. Hwang agreed to testify
against you...</b>

137
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:31,159
<b>regarding your request.</b>

138
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:35,500
<b>You can easily become a suspect...</b>

139
00:15:35,899 --> 00:15:37,470
<b>with the photos in that USB.</b>

140
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:39,976
<b>They're proof that you were present
at the crime scenes,</b>

141
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,080
<b>so you'll be suspected
as an accomplice at the least.</b>

142
00:15:42,539 --> 00:15:44,779
<b>Do you think Ms. Lee Shin
will still have your back then?</b>

143
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,950
<b>The killer could've seen you.</b>

144
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:55,950
<b>You could've died.</b>

145
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:59,960
<b>What does she have on you
that you're going this far?</b>

146
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,360
<b>If you can help us,</b>

147
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,000
<b>we'll be able to...</b>

148
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:10,169
<b>get rid of Ms. Lee Shin
and the killer as well.</b>

149
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,840
<b>I beg you.</b>

150
00:16:18,809 --> 00:16:20,039
<b>Ms. Song.</b>

151
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:32,395
<b>Why did you have to make things
so complicated...</b>

152
00:16:32,419 --> 00:16:34,529
<b>if you were going
to turn yourself in anyway?</b>

153
00:16:35,289 --> 00:16:37,629
<b>Thanks to you,
the chief may have to make...</b>

154
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:40,330
<b>a public apology, do you understand?</b>

155
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:45,139
<b>Since we've come to this,
let's pick the easy way.</b>

156
00:16:47,539 --> 00:16:50,940
<b>Do you admit to the murders
of Bae Jung Tae and Ko Jae Young?</b>

157
00:16:54,039 --> 00:16:55,350
<b>Detective Ji Hyeong Ju!</b>

158
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:17,769
<b>What are Ji Hyeong Ju
and Shin Ga Hyeon scheming?</b>

159
00:17:18,039 --> 00:17:19,200
<b>You must know.</b>

<b>Tell me. Why did he turn himself in?</b>

161
00:17:21,069 --> 00:17:22,839
<b>I... I don't know.</b>

162

<b>I don't know anything about this.</b>

163

<b>Did Ms. Lee Shin contact you

164
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:39,519
<b>I was wondering if Ms. Song
reported to her.</b>

165

<b>No.</b>

166

<b>Something happened to my wife,

<b>I'll contact you later.</b>

168
00:18:06,779 --> 00:18:08,650
<b>It's nothing serious, right?</b>

169
00:18:19,529 --> 00:18:22,775
<b>I'll have to see. We'll talk again.</b>

170

<b>They're the only ones left.</b>

175
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:08,055
<b>We found these cuffs
at the crime scene,</b>

176
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:09,750
<b>and they turned out to be yours.</b>

177
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:11,555
<b>We've also confirmed
that you used this burner phone...</b>

<b>to contact Bae Jung Tae

179

<b>There was also the text

180
00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:20,765
<b>You were the first one to find...</b>

181
00:19:20,789 --> 00:19:23,130
<b>Bae Jung Tae's body and report it.</b>

182
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:26,759
<b>Perhaps, this could be
a fabricated scenario as well.</b>

183
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,640
<b>Conclusively,
we found these wounds...</b>

184

<b>on their stomachs.</b>

185
00:19:34,069 --> 00:19:35,869
<b>The NFS believes...</b>

186
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:37,980
<b>it was the same killer.</b>

187
00:19:41,049 --> 00:19:42,849
<b>Is that what you think as well?</b>

188
00:19:44,619 --> 00:19:45,979
<b>Do you think it's the same killer?</b>

189
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:49,019
<b>Do you think
this is a serial murder?</b>

190
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:51,519
<b>Are you asking me?</b>

191
00:20:00,099 --> 00:20:02,230
<b>If we overcome our fate,</b>

192
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:05,369
<b>how will it benefit you?</b>

193
00:20:06,339 --> 00:20:07,869
<b>You always said that.</b>

194
00:20:08,309 --> 00:20:11,109
<b>"I want to see you
overcoming your fate."</b>

195
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:13,555
<b>"That's why
I gave you another chance."</b>

196
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:16,525
<b>Is fate already decided,</b>

197
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:18,295
<b>or can it be changed?</b>

198
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:20,119
<b>That's why I decided to experiment.</b>

199
00:20:20,849 --> 00:20:22,795
<b>What if I bring back the dead...</b>

200
00:20:22,819 --> 00:20:24,636
<b>and reset the time?</b>

201
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:27,859
<b>Why did you take things so far
and do this with us?</b>

202
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:35,200
<b>It's a real drag to bear through...</b>

203
00:20:37,529 --> 00:20:39,569
<b>a time without any hope.</b>

204
00:20:41,069 --> 00:20:44,269
<b>I needed something fun to do
to live through this boring year.</b>

205
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,650
<b>I realized there are people
who suffer more than I do,</b>

206
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,525
<b>so it was comforting too.</b>

207
00:20:52,549 --> 00:20:55,619
<b>You were so desperate
to save someone,</b>

208
00:20:57,349 --> 00:21:00,390
<b>yet I didn't know
how you could be so cruel to us.</b>

209
00:21:01,589 --> 00:21:03,690
<b>At first, I didn't get it,</b>

210
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:05,930
<b>but everything
definitely makes sense now.</b>

211
00:21:08,369 --> 00:21:10,900
<b>You didn't reset the time
for your child.</b>

212
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,640
<b>You already know that.</b>

213
00:21:14,839 --> 00:21:17,485
<b>It's because of you,
who can't bear to live on...</b>

214
00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:19,240
<b>after the death of your child.</b>

215
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,480
<b>You keep running away back in time,</b>

216
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:24,579
<b>into the past.</b>

217
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,589
<b>It's time for you

218
00:22:21,339 --> 00:22:23,640
<b>Young, are you still mad at me?</b>

219
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:27,309
<b>You didn't keep your promise.</b>

220
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,380
<b>You said
we're going to ride on a train.</b>

221
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:31,880
<b>I wanted to keep my promise,</b>

222

223
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:36,819
<b>I'm not sick at all.</b>

224
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:38,819
<b>I want to ride on a train.</b>

225
00:22:41,089 --> 00:22:43,289
<b>We have to go

<b>As soon as you get well,</b>

227
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,630

<b>You always lie.</b>

230
00:22:52,599 --> 00:22:54,039
<b>I don't like the hospital.</b>

231
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,369
<b>I'm not going.</b>

232
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:59,579
<b>Then will you continue to be sick?</b>

233
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:01,809
<b>You'll break my heart.</b>

234
00:23:05,349 --> 00:23:07,150
<b>Mom, are you heartbroken?</b>

235
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:13,289
<b>No, I'm fine.</b>

236

240

<b>Please do keep your promise.</b>

245
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:32,000
<b>Thank you. Thank you, Detective.</b>

<b>He was caught by

<b>He said he made a mistake

<b>No.</b>

<b>- Get back to work.
- Yes, sir.</b>

<b>Let's call this your fate, Mr. Park.</b>

<b>Hey. Where are you going?</b>

258

<b>To meet Ms. Shin Ga Hyeon.</b>

259

<b>I was wondering if she knows

260
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:19,549
<b>Do you want to come along?</b>

261
00:25:19,779 --> 00:25:21,990
<b>- No, go ahead.
- Okay.</b>

262
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:27,559
<b>I thought you would know...</b>

<b>what Hyeong Ju is up to.</b>

264
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:33,400
<b>He's not a guy who'd kill a man.</b>

265
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:35,876
<b>He even ran away
to catch the real culprit.</b>

266
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:37,400
<b>Why is he suddenly doing this?</b>

267
00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:43,410
<b>You know something, don't you?</b>

268
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,480
<b>Ga Hyeon, we need to know
what's going on to help.</b>

269
00:25:51,579 --> 00:25:53,519
<b>He said the evidence...</b>

270
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:56,260
<b>that can catch the culprit is
in the police station.</b>

271

<b>That's why he has no choice

<b>The evidence? What is it?</b>

<b>He said it should be

275
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:10,700
<b>Ko Jae Young

<b>And Hyeong Ju said...</b>

<b>the headphone wasn't

278

<b>What does that have to do
with his phone?</b>

279
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,186
<b>His headphone has...</b>

280
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:19,785
<b>a GPS tracking device...</b>

281
00:26:19,809 --> 00:26:22,049
<b>that's connected to his phone.</b>

282

<b>If the real culprit
has his headphone...</b>

283

<b>or hid it somewhere,</b>

284

<b>Wait.</b>

286
00:26:30,049 --> 00:26:32,095
<b>Then he could've just asked us.</b>

287
00:26:32,119 --> 00:26:33,589
<b>Why would he come himself?</b>

288
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:37,589
<b>Because of reasons I can't share.</b>

<b>- No.
- What's wrong with your hand?</b>

471
00:46:18,630 --> 00:46:20,106
<b>- Your hand...
- Hey.</b>

472
00:46:20,130 --> 00:46:21,670
<b>- He didn't hit me.
- Park Sun Ho!</b>

473
00:46:22,130 --> 00:46:23,946
<b>- Park Sun Ho, what's up with you?
- My gosh.</b>

474
00:46:23,970 --> 00:46:26,345
<b>- Hey, get out!
- You piece of trash!</b>

475
00:46:26,369 --> 00:46:28,509
<b>- Get out.
- That jerk!</b>

476
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:50,390
<b>After he became a lieutenant,</b>

477
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:53,400
<b>he was really happy.</b>

478
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:59,339
<b>He bragged to everyone
that he was going to be a good cop.</b>

479
00:47:03,569 --> 00:47:05,140
<b>But that's when it started.</b>

480
00:47:08,950 --> 00:47:10,480
<b>He didn't even have...</b>

481
00:47:12,650 --> 00:47:14,380
<b>a proper reason behind his murders.</b>

482
00:47:16,619 --> 00:47:18,119
<b>It was just a game to him.</b>

483
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:22,960
<b>A game that proved
how perfect he was.</b>

484
00:47:24,630 --> 00:47:25,799
<b>That kind of game.</b>

485
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:33,140
<b>He did prove...</b>

486
00:47:35,210 --> 00:47:37,210
<b>that there's no perfect crime.</b>

487
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:40,309
<b>And that he's bound to face...</b>

488
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:43,480
<b>the punishment one day.</b>

489
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:49,750
<b>You set that straight, Hyeong Ju.</b>

490
00:47:58,799 --> 00:48:00,630
<b>No, you changed it, Ga Hyeon.</b>

491
00:48:18,109 --> 00:48:21,049
<b>I arrested Park Sun Ho.</b>

492
00:48:23,420 --> 00:48:24,549
<b>I see.</b>

493
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:27,960
<b>I read the news article.</b>

494
00:48:28,329 --> 00:48:30,789
<b>You said that

495

496

<b>Your experiment...</b>

498
00:48:41,170 --> 00:48:42,539

499
00:48:43,569 --> 00:48:46,740
<b>I will do whatever it takes to stop

<b>I'll do everything in my power...</b>

501
00:48:50,410 --> 00:48:52,220
<b>and stop you.</b>

502
00:48:54,119 --> 00:48:57,295
<b>So you don't have

503

<b>of looking for your next victims.</b>

504
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:02,660
<b>Things will be interesting...</b>

505
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:07,299

506
00:49:10,569 --> 00:49:11,740
<b>I'll look forward to it.</b>

<b>Mr. Park, an active detective

<b>According to

517
00:50:32,849 --> 00:50:34,720
<b>Right. That's so interesting.</b>

518
00:50:35,349 --> 00:50:38,589
<b>I just named the dog

<b>Happy birthday.</b>

525

<b>This feels strange.</b>

526

<b>It's nice to celebrate

527

<b>In light of that,
I got you a present.</b>

528
00:51:34,910 --> 00:51:36,009
<b>A present?</b>

529
00:51:39,950 --> 00:51:42,220
<b>It's made of silk.</b>

<b>I want you to live a long life.</b>

531

<b>There's one more for Maru.

<b>This is touching. Thank you.</b>

533

<b>I'll sign it.</b>

535
00:51:56,930 --> 00:51:58,740
<b>- What?
- It made me wonder...</b>

536

540
00:52:40,539 --> 00:52:43,349
<b>How's the cafe owner doing

<b>Yes, Hyeong Ju.
He's not at the cafe.</b>

<b>Could he still be at the sanitorium?</b>

545
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:27,535
<b>Something happened to my wife,</b>

<b>so I had to hurry to the sanitarium.</b>

547
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:31,259
<b>That's the day...</b>

548

<b>(Something happened to my wife.)</b>

550

<b>(It's okay, Ga Hyeon. Are you okay?

<b>The period.</b>

553
00:53:48,849 --> 00:53:50,325
<b>(It's okay, Ga Hyeon. Are you okay?

554
00:53:50,349 --> 00:53:52,356
<b>(I had to hurry to the sanitarium

556
00:53:54,579 --> 00:53:56,549
<b>He always ends with the period.</b>

557

<b>The name of the guardian

<b>Can you tell me

559
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:11,700
<b>There's no such guardian.</b>

560
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:14,140
<b>Do you know the name of the patient?</b>

561

<b>No.</b>

<b>Hold on. Hwang No Sub?</b>

563

<b>Are you looking

<b>Professor?</b>

<b>It's this man.</b>

566
00:54:28,279 --> 00:54:30,119
<b>Yes, it's him.
It's Professor Hwang No Sub.</b>

<b>He's running a clinical trial

568
00:54:33,220 --> 00:54:34,819
<b>He comes here at least once a week.</b>

569
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:37,730
<b>- A clinical trial?
- His wife isn't staying here?</b>

570
00:54:37,789 --> 00:54:40,859
<b>I heard that his wife is running
a business in the States.</b>

571
00:54:40,930 --> 00:54:43,606
<b>I didn't want to
leave my wife in the sanitorium...</b>

572
00:54:43,630 --> 00:54:46,200
<b>when I realized
I don't know when I'll die.</b>

573
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:48,839
<b>How is she doing?</b>

574
00:54:49,210 --> 00:54:52,039
<b>Ever since that day,
her condition has worsened.</b>

575
00:54:52,579 --> 00:54:54,839
<b>She couldn't even
recognize me yesterday.</b>

576
00:54:55,849 --> 00:54:58,825
<b>Then, if he's a professor,</b>

577
00:54:58,849 --> 00:55:00,680
<b>can you tell me where he works?</b>

578
00:55:00,750 --> 00:55:02,595
<b>He used to work at Sejin Hospital.</b>

579
00:55:02,619 --> 00:55:05,089
<b>But now, he's an advisory director
for Samo Pharmaceuticals.</b>

580

<b>Sejin Hospital?</b>

581
00:55:10,529 --> 00:55:12,630
<b>The sanitorium

582
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:14,930
<b>They were all lies.</b>

583
00:55:16,299 --> 00:55:18,500
<b>Why would he lie about this?</b>

584
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:20,940
<b>If he was a professor
at Sejin Hospital,</b>

585
00:55:20,970 --> 00:55:23,509
<b>it means that he knew
Ms. Lee Shin before the reset.</b>

586
00:55:23,569 --> 00:55:24,845
<b>Let's not talk about this here.</b>

587
00:55:24,869 --> 00:55:27,456
<b>Let's go somewhere else
and chat more.</b>

588
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:30,180
<b>I used to be a regular here.</b>

589
00:55:30,279 --> 00:55:32,495
<b>My wife loved drinking coffee...</b>

590
00:55:32,519 --> 00:55:35,255
<b>and wanted to open one
later on in life.</b>

591
00:55:35,279 --> 00:55:37,765
<b>So I was able to buy this place,
thanks to the reset.</b>

592
00:55:37,789 --> 00:55:39,059
<b>Then,</b>

593
00:55:39,490 --> 00:55:42,130
<b>did Ms. Lee Shin order him
to gather us at the cafe...</b>

594
00:55:42,559 --> 00:55:44,460
<b>from the get-go?</b>

595
00:55:47,329 --> 00:55:48,359
<b>Detective.</b>

596
00:56:04,279 --> 00:56:06,579
<b>He was here this Monday.</b>

597
00:56:06,819 --> 00:56:09,950
<b>Monday?
That's after Sun Ho got arrested.</b>

<b>Hyeong Ju.</b>

599

<b>Why is Ms. Song here?</b>

600
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:21,660
<b>This is Professor Hwang's secretary.</b>

601
00:56:21,759 --> 00:56:23,230
<b>- His secretary?
- Yes.</b>

602
00:56:40,420 --> 00:56:42,950
<b>If you can help us,</b>

603
00:56:43,349 --> 00:56:44,589
<b>we'll be able to...</b>

604

<b>get rid of Ms. Lee Shin

<b>I beg you.</b>

606
00:56:54,599 --> 00:56:56,299
<b>It was all an act.</b>

607
00:56:57,099 --> 00:57:01,015
<b>It's as if she knows the future.
She knew everything about me.</b>

was terrified of...</b>

609

<b>wasn't Ms. Lee Shin.
It was Professor Hwang.</b>

610

<b>From the beginning, he made
Ms. Lee Shin take the front line.</b>

<b>You're back, Professor Hwang.</b>
