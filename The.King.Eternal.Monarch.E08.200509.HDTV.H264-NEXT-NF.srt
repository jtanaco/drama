180
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:32,150

<b>I didn't send anything like that.</b>

<b>What would you like? The mackerel

<b>Yes.</b>

190
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:01,054
<b>I had a feeling you'd come back for it,

<b>That's why you looked familiar.</b>

192

<b>Just a moment, please.</b>

194
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:39,759
<b>You got out pretty quickly.</b>

195
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:41,720
<b>And your style has changed.</b>

196
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:09,873
<b>I just grabbed a random jacket I found
on the run.</b>

<b>It's getting cold.</b>

198
00:13:12,626 --> 00:13:14,127
<b>Put it on or you'll freeze to death.</b>

199
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:16,254
<b>Then why do you live in a van?</b>

200
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:19,633
<b>You steal stuff every day,
and you're still broke?</b>

201

<b>No, I have a lot of money.</b>

202

<b>But I also have a lot of enemies.</b>

<b>It's a world you don't need to know about.</b>

204

<b>Leave it anywhere there.</b>

205
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:55,668
<b>Thank you.</b>

00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:07,555
<b>I heard you like sweets.</b>

<b>I'm sure you saw it at the scene.</b>

220

<b>She died from exsanguination
from the two neck wounds.</b>

221
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:48,430
<b>A small amount of zolpidem

<b>which explains
why there are no defense wounds.</b>

223

<b>I was suspecting her boyfriend

<b>but I should reinvestigate her roommate.</b>

225

<b>Yes, I agree.</b>

<b>I've also been suspicious

<b>Detective Kang, it's not you, right?</b>

228
00:15:05,322 --> 00:15:07,532
<b>-Sorry?
-The one who keeps calling my hubby out.</b>

<b>You're his alibi, but I'm debating

<b>A small amount of zolpidem was found.</b>

<b>She was sedated, then stabbed.</b>

241

<b>Then maybe it wasn't Park Jung-gu.
He fed her, sedated her,</b>

242
00:15:58,291 --> 00:15:59,417
<b>stabbed her, and ran?</b>

243

<b>First, remove the boyfriend
from the suspect list.</b>

<b>Wow.</b>

309
00:19:42,056 --> 00:19:43,224
<b>Thank you. The food was great.</b>

310
00:19:43,391 --> 00:19:44,642
<b>Thank you.</b>

311
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:49,314
<b>Gosh, jeez.</b>

312
00:19:49,397 --> 00:19:50,857
<b>-Are they fighting?
-Goodness.</b>

<b>Yeong would never...</b>

366
00:22:18,296 --> 00:22:19,464
<b>He'd never call me a fool.</b>

367

<b>Yeong knows</b>

<b>what I use my long legs for.</b>

373
00:22:30,641 --> 00:22:31,642
<b>Maybe I'm Eun-sup, then.</b>

<b>Eun-sup will also be beheaded

376
00:22:40,651 --> 00:22:43,279
<b>I wish to be a wise and merciful king.</b>

<b>Don't forget.</b>

380
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:01,422
<b>You will be beheaded

381
00:23:03,257 --> 00:23:05,635
<b>Thank you for your boundless mercy.</b>

382
00:23:07,178 --> 00:23:08,012
<b>Sure thing.</b>

383
00:23:14,227 --> 00:23:15,061
<b>It's me.</b>

384
00:23:15,645 --> 00:23:16,729
<i><b>Hey, where are you?</i></b>

385
00:23:17,271 --> 00:23:18,564
<i><b>What's up?</i></b>

386
00:23:19,148 --> 00:23:20,900
<b>You told me to call you
when I'm on the move.</b>

387
00:23:21,651 --> 00:23:24,028
<b>I called you because
I'm rushing to go somewhere now.</b>

388
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:25,905
<b>-<i>Where are you going?</i>
-To the living room.</b>

389
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:30,451
<b>Eun-sup's place can't be that big.</b>

390
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:33,538
<i><b>I moved to a hotel.</i></b>

391
00:23:34,038 --> 00:23:36,040
<i><b>Eun-sup's siblings
have gone back to school.</i></b>

392
00:23:36,624 --> 00:23:38,668
<i><b>Now, I'm headed to the fridge
from the living room.</i></b>

393
00:23:39,293 --> 00:23:40,336
<i><b>It's time for some coffee.</i></b>

394
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:44,048
<b>The fridge? You should've called me
when you were leaving his place</b>

395
00:23:44,298 --> 00:23:45,716
<b>to go to the hotel.</b>

396
00:23:48,928 --> 00:23:49,804
<b>What?</b>

397
00:23:50,221 --> 00:23:51,138
<b>What happened?</b>

398
00:23:51,764 --> 00:23:54,141
<i><b>Hello? What's wrong? Did you get hurt?</i></b>

399
00:23:54,976 --> 00:23:56,686
<b>It's not that. I'm just surprised.</b>

400
00:23:57,728 --> 00:24:00,773
<b>The coffee Yeong got tastes just like
the coffee I drink at the palace.</b>

401
00:24:01,983 --> 00:24:04,235
<b>Rich and flavorful at the beginning
and clean at the end.</b>

402
00:24:05,194 --> 00:24:06,988
<b>This is sold in stores here?</b>

403
00:24:07,071 --> 00:24:08,823
<b>Are you kidding me?</b>

404
00:24:09,991 --> 00:24:13,244
<b>I think I know which hotel it is.
I'm in the area now.</b>

405
00:24:13,536 --> 00:24:15,788
<b>I'll give you ten minutes.
Come down right now.</b>

406
00:24:19,542 --> 00:24:20,793
<b>So my theory was right.</b>

407
00:24:21,752 --> 00:24:24,714
<b>I have to irritate her to see her.</b>

408
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:30,845
<b>She'll say she has to leave quickly.</b>

409
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:32,888
<b>I'd say about 20 minutes?</b>

410
00:24:33,347 --> 00:24:34,599
<b>I'm saying, don't follow me.</b>

411
00:25:08,633 --> 00:25:09,884
<b>Eight minutes and forty seconds.</b>

412
00:25:11,677 --> 00:25:12,928
<b>I came down right away.</b>

413
00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:16,807
<b>-Yeong wanted to follow me, so I--
-The very first time you came here...</b>

414
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,769
<b>Would you still have fallen for me</b>

415
00:25:20,645 --> 00:25:22,021
<b>even if I had never helped you?</b>

416
00:25:26,275 --> 00:25:27,193
<b>I would've understood.</b>

417
00:25:29,654 --> 00:25:30,571
<b>And that understanding</b>

418
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:32,782
<b>would've led me to fall for you.</b>

419
00:25:33,282 --> 00:25:35,785
<b>What if I was super rude to you?
Still the same answer?</b>

420
00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:36,994
<b>You were super rude.</b>

421
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:41,957
<b>Yes, still the same answer.</b>

422
00:25:45,503 --> 00:25:46,337
<b>Why?</b>

423
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:49,131
<b>Because you must've had your reason.</b>

424
00:25:53,844 --> 00:25:56,305
<i><b>It took me a long time to realize this.</i></b>

425
00:25:57,682 --> 00:25:58,599
<i><b>When it's fate,</i></b>

426
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:00,518
<i><b>there are no coincidences.</i></b>

427
00:26:02,061 --> 00:26:04,271
<i><b>Your fate is determined
by the choices you make,</i></b>

428
00:26:05,106 --> 00:26:06,440
<i><b>but there are times</i></b>

429
00:26:08,025 --> 00:26:10,277
<i><b>when your fate chooses you.</i></b>

430
00:26:11,445 --> 00:26:12,446
<b>Why do you ask?</b>

431
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:15,533
<b>In the beginning,
you have to ask about everything.</b>

432
00:26:15,783 --> 00:26:17,368
<b>We just skipped too many things.</b>

433
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:20,830
<b>I have to go on a stakeout.</b>

434
00:26:21,539 --> 00:26:22,832
<b>I got to see you, so I'm off.</b>

435
00:26:23,249 --> 00:26:24,166
<b>Did something happen?</b>

436
00:26:27,628 --> 00:26:28,462
<b>No, not at all.</b>

437
00:26:29,046 --> 00:26:29,922
<b>It's been a quiet,</b>

438
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:31,674
<b>peaceful day.</b>

439
00:26:33,551 --> 00:26:35,594
<b>This is probably the most eventful moment
of the day.</b>

440
00:26:35,678 --> 00:26:38,264
<b>You came to see me</b>

441
00:26:39,056 --> 00:26:40,391
<b>despite the traffic jam.</b>

442
00:26:40,516 --> 00:26:42,601
<b>I haven't eaten yet, so I'm irritable now.</b>

443
00:26:43,978 --> 00:26:45,563
<b>I'm adding 1 more into the 17 rules.</b>

444
00:26:46,147 --> 00:26:47,940
<b>No cheesy comments when I'm hungry.</b>

445
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:51,026
<b>Anyway, I'm glad everything is good.
I'm off.</b>

446
00:26:53,988 --> 00:26:55,489
<i><b>Things that are bound to happen</i></b>

447
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:58,868
<i><b>are taking place even at this moment.</i></b>

448
00:27:00,244 --> 00:27:03,789
<i><b>I was struck with a sad premonition
that this will be short-lived,</i></b>

449
00:27:05,416 --> 00:27:08,586
<i><b>but I decided to love my fate</i></b>

450
00:27:09,253 --> 00:27:10,880
<i><b>that chose me.</i></b>

451
00:27:11,422 --> 00:27:12,298
<b>I love you.</b>

452
00:27:20,681 --> 00:27:22,266
<b>Yeong is in the hotel room, right?</b>

453
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:23,350
<b>Hang on.</b>

454
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,439
<b>I'm still</b>

455
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:30,900
<b>mesmerized by what you said earlier.</b>

456
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:38,115
<b>Yeong went out.</b>

457
00:27:38,282 --> 00:27:39,992
<b>He just walked by. Didn't you see him?</b>

458
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:41,744
<b>He has to... No.</b>

459
00:27:42,828 --> 00:27:43,829
<b>That's not important.</b>

460
00:27:46,332 --> 00:27:47,208
<b>I mean,</b>

461
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:50,294
<b>you just said--</b>

462
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:51,504
<b>I told you he can't go out.</b>

463
00:27:51,962 --> 00:27:53,047
<b>Find him and go back in.</b>

464
00:27:55,549 --> 00:27:56,383
<b>Jeong Tae-eul.</b>

465
00:27:59,178 --> 00:28:00,012
<b>Ditto.</b>

466
00:28:21,117 --> 00:28:22,368
<b>You obviously heard what I said.</b>

467
00:28:28,499 --> 00:28:29,750
<b>Don't worry about Yeong.</b>

468
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:33,504
<b>He's done it once,
so he won't get busted again.</b>

469
00:28:43,025 --> 00:28:43,901
<b>Hey, Jo Eun-sup!</b>

470
00:28:45,611 --> 00:28:46,612
<i><b>I'm in trouble.</i></b>

471
00:28:46,946 --> 00:28:48,030
<i><b>A female voice.</i></b>

472
00:28:55,872 --> 00:28:58,166
<b>Don't you dare run away.
You were about to sprint!</b>

473
00:29:01,377 --> 00:29:02,920
<i><b>She looks like Myeong Seung-a.</i></b>

474
00:29:03,504 --> 00:29:05,089
<i><b>I wonder who that woman is.</i></b>

475
00:29:05,423 --> 00:29:08,342
<b>What the heck? Shouldn't you be
at the police station now?</b>

476
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,138
<b>Hold on, you're wearing...</b>

477
00:29:13,598 --> 00:29:14,640
<b>Did you have a blind date?</b>

478
00:29:16,767 --> 00:29:18,186
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

479
00:29:19,228 --> 00:29:20,396
<b>Were you at a funeral?</b>

480
00:29:22,315 --> 00:29:23,274
<b>You got your hair done.</b>

481
00:29:25,026 --> 00:29:26,694
<i><b>I can't draw any more attention.</i></b>

482
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,078
<b>Are you calling me over?</b>

483
00:29:37,079 --> 00:29:38,122
<b>With your finger?</b>

484
00:29:39,207 --> 00:29:40,458
<b>Jeez, has he lost his mind?</b>

485
00:29:46,339 --> 00:29:47,965
<b>It'd better be about something important!</b>

486
00:29:50,259 --> 00:29:51,385
<i><b>She's tough.</i></b>

487
00:29:52,178 --> 00:29:53,429
<i><b>Then there's only one way.</i></b>

488
00:30:01,896 --> 00:30:03,272
<b>I'm curious about something.</b>

489
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:09,403
<b>Do I have a crush on you?</b>

490
00:30:09,695 --> 00:30:11,113
<b>Or is it the other way around?</b>

491
00:30:12,365 --> 00:30:13,366
<b>I mean, in this world.</b>

492
00:30:17,245 --> 00:30:18,996
<b>This is why you don't have a girlfriend.</b>

493
00:30:19,413 --> 00:30:20,456
<b>Cut it out.</b>

494
00:30:21,290 --> 00:30:22,875
<b>What's that on your face? Seaweed?</b>

495
00:30:22,959 --> 00:30:23,793
<b>Don't touch it, or...</b>

496
00:30:24,752 --> 00:30:26,754
<b>Or what? Try causing trouble.</b>

497
00:30:26,963 --> 00:30:28,673
<b>I made <i>japchae</i>, so pick it up later.</b>

498
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:40,518
<b>Gosh, that guy can fight.</b>

499
00:30:40,601 --> 00:30:42,728
<b>I'm a pretty good fighter too.</b>

500
00:30:49,652 --> 00:30:52,530
<b>Jeez, you scared the crap out of me.
What do you want from me?</b>

501
00:30:52,613 --> 00:30:54,907
<b>Hey, Tae-eul said
that you can only go out at night--</b>

502
00:30:54,991 --> 00:30:57,410
<b>Who is this woman?
She's kind of pretty and...</b>

503
00:30:57,493 --> 00:30:59,537
<b>Jo Yeong. You're really him.
This is unbelievable.</b>

504
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:01,247
<b>-She has pretty eyes.
-Na-ri.</b>

505
00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:03,082
<b>-She drives a supercar.
-Myeong Na-ri.</b>

506
00:31:04,292 --> 00:31:05,835
<b>Hey, did you meet Na-ri?</b>

507
00:31:06,252 --> 00:31:08,296
<b>What did she say?
Tell me everything she said.</b>

508
00:31:08,379 --> 00:31:09,964
<b>She wants to get in trouble with you.</b>

509
00:31:10,798 --> 00:31:12,008
<b>And told me to pick up <i>japchae</i>.</b>

510
00:31:14,302 --> 00:31:16,971
<i><b>Japchae</i>? Get in trouble? With me?</b>

511
00:31:18,764 --> 00:31:20,474
<b>Can you elaborate?</b>

512
00:31:20,558 --> 00:31:22,268
<b>What did you say
before the <i>japchae</i> comment?</b>

513
00:31:22,351 --> 00:31:23,602
<b>Why would she give me <i>japchae</i>?</b>

514
00:31:23,686 --> 00:31:25,813
<b>-Do you have a crush on her?
-Who wouldn't?</b>

515
00:31:28,232 --> 00:31:30,776
<b>Anyway, I can't go now.</b>

516
00:31:31,277 --> 00:31:33,654
<b>Call her and tell her
that I'll stop by another time.</b>

517
00:31:33,738 --> 00:31:34,864
<b>I need to calm down first.</b>

518
00:31:35,865 --> 00:31:37,908
<b>Na-ri and I? Our first <i>japchae</i> together?</b>

519
00:31:39,035 --> 00:31:39,952
<b>Loser.</b>

520
00:31:40,161 --> 00:31:42,371
<b>How much time do you need?
Would ten minutes be enough?</b>

521
00:31:43,748 --> 00:31:44,749
<b>A hundred years!</b>

522
00:31:45,041 --> 00:31:46,042
<b>Loser.</b>

523
00:31:55,843 --> 00:31:56,802
<b>Tae-eul, you're here.</b>

524
00:31:56,886 --> 00:31:58,220
<b>Hey, any leads?</b>

525
00:31:59,805 --> 00:32:00,681
<b>So far, nothing.</b>

526
00:32:05,728 --> 00:32:06,562
<b>It's so refreshing.</b>

527
00:32:07,146 --> 00:32:08,481
<b>You know your kimchi, Jangmi.</b>

528
00:32:13,361 --> 00:32:14,403
<b>What is all that?</b>

529
00:32:15,738 --> 00:32:18,366
<b>Detective Shim said I'd need
a lot of things for my first stakeout.</b>

530
00:32:19,784 --> 00:32:20,743
<b>Are you going camping?</b>

531
00:32:23,079 --> 00:32:26,123
<b>By the way, what's going on with Sin-jae?</b>

532
00:32:26,290 --> 00:32:27,375
<b>Why did he switch with you?</b>

533
00:32:28,125 --> 00:32:29,085
<b>I didn't ask.</b>

534
00:32:30,252 --> 00:32:31,962
<b>I wouldn't have to ask</b>

535
00:32:32,046 --> 00:32:33,964
<b>if he was going to tell me.</b>

536
00:32:35,966 --> 00:32:38,886
<b>Impressive.
That's why I didn't ask him either.</b>

537
00:32:45,351 --> 00:32:46,227
<b>What?</b>

538
00:32:47,144 --> 00:32:50,064
<b>Are you amazed by how wise I am?</b>

539
00:32:50,147 --> 00:32:51,190
<b>No, it's not that.</b>

540
00:32:51,482 --> 00:32:54,902
<b>What is that little gadget?
You can use it for your lips and face?</b>

541
00:32:57,696 --> 00:32:59,615
<b>The old sayings are always so true.</b>

542
00:33:00,741 --> 00:33:03,411
<b>You can't even use multi-purpose balm
in front of kids.</b>

543
00:33:04,286 --> 00:33:05,162
<b>You can have it.</b>

544
00:33:05,246 --> 00:33:06,539
<b>This is the be-all and end-all.</b>

545
00:33:08,833 --> 00:33:09,750
<b>Thank you.</b>

546
00:33:10,668 --> 00:33:11,502
<b>Oh, my.</b>

547
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:16,132
<b>Are we sure Park Jung-gu isn't home yet?</b>

548
00:33:16,715 --> 00:33:18,134
<b>Yes, I checked.</b>

549
00:33:18,801 --> 00:33:19,677
<b>Okay.</b>

550
00:33:20,344 --> 00:33:21,220
<b>Oh, nice.</b>

551
00:33:22,638 --> 00:33:24,682
<b>About the victim...</b>

552
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:29,687
<b>She probably never even imagined
she'd die like that, right?</b>

553
00:33:33,858 --> 00:33:34,733
<b>Jangmi.</b>

554
00:33:35,901 --> 00:33:37,695
<b>It's your first time
at a murder scene, right?</b>

555
00:33:38,988 --> 00:33:39,822
<b>Yes.</b>

556
00:33:40,406 --> 00:33:42,116
<b>Did you know that many cops
commit suicide?</b>

557
00:33:42,741 --> 00:33:43,617
<b>What?</b>

558
00:33:43,701 --> 00:33:46,412
<b>You'll see countless more cases like this
going forward.</b>

559
00:33:47,288 --> 00:33:48,205
<b>Remember, work is work.</b>

560
00:33:49,373 --> 00:33:51,417
<b>We must do our best
to investigate every case.</b>

561
00:33:52,251 --> 00:33:56,547
<b>When the case is closed, we have to do
our best to forget about it and move on,</b>

562
00:33:57,256 --> 00:33:58,716
<b>or you can't do this for a long time.</b>

563
00:34:00,718 --> 00:34:01,594
<b>Okay.</b>

564
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:06,515
<b>What do we need to do to close this case?</b>

565
00:34:07,433 --> 00:34:09,018
<b>We should catch the killer, right?</b>

566
00:34:10,102 --> 00:34:12,021
<b>-Yes.
-Keep your eyes peeled.</b>

567
00:34:13,105 --> 00:34:14,231
<b>I'll have my eyes peeled.</b>

568
00:34:17,818 --> 00:34:19,737
<b>Park Jung-gu, spotted.</b>

569
00:34:20,571 --> 00:34:21,947
<b>Jangmi, let's go!</b>

570
00:34:24,992 --> 00:34:25,868
<b>Mr. Park Jung-gu?</b>

571
00:34:25,951 --> 00:34:27,119
<b>Damn it!</b>

572
00:34:35,211 --> 00:34:36,504
<b>My gosh.</b>

573
00:34:43,219 --> 00:34:44,845
<b>Tae-eul! I caught him.</b>

574
00:34:48,724 --> 00:34:50,476
<b>I think I caught the suspect.</b>

575
00:34:51,477 --> 00:34:52,353
<b>All right.</b>

576
00:34:56,106 --> 00:34:58,776
<b>But he doesn't seem to be breathing.</b>

577
00:34:59,985 --> 00:35:02,530
<b>Hey, no.
We don't have an extra set of handcuffs.</b>

578
00:35:05,324 --> 00:35:06,534
<b>Mr. Park Jung-gu.</b>

579
00:35:07,576 --> 00:35:08,869
<b>Wake up.</b>

580
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:10,663
<i><b>Jangmi caught Park Jung-gu.</i></b>

581
00:35:11,872 --> 00:35:13,874
<b>Mr. Park.</b>

582
00:35:13,958 --> 00:35:15,626
<i><b>I just got home.</i></b>

583
00:35:16,377 --> 00:35:18,087
<i><b>I'll be there fairly soon.</i></b>

584
00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:20,381
<b>Tae-eul, he's not breathing...</b>

585
00:35:20,464 --> 00:35:21,757
<b>What do I do?</b>

586
00:35:22,299 --> 00:35:25,219
<i><b>Sin-jae, don't pretend
you haven't seen my message.</i></b>

587
00:35:25,594 --> 00:35:26,428
<b>Mr. Park!</b>

588
00:35:43,237 --> 00:35:44,488
<b>This restaurant is busy.</b>

589
00:35:47,241 --> 00:35:48,075
<b>Mom.</b>

590
00:35:50,369 --> 00:35:51,579
<b>Is it that fun?</b>

591
00:35:56,041 --> 00:35:57,001
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

592
00:35:58,669 --> 00:36:00,129
<b>I promise I won't do it again.</b>

593
00:36:01,755 --> 00:36:04,425
<b>When I'm sitting there,
I feel like everything's going to go well.</b>

594
00:36:05,259 --> 00:36:08,137
<b>And it helps me get my mind off things.</b>

595
00:36:10,681 --> 00:36:13,892
<b>I'm broke now,
so I can't even wager large amounts.</b>

596
00:36:17,229 --> 00:36:19,523
<b>You were ill for a long time, you know.</b>

597
00:36:21,442 --> 00:36:22,943
<b>When you regained your consciousness,</b>

598
00:36:23,736 --> 00:36:25,571
<b>I felt like the whole world was mine.</b>

599
00:36:25,863 --> 00:36:29,033
<b>I thought only happiness awaited us.
But then, that thing happened to your dad.</b>

600
00:36:29,617 --> 00:36:31,619
<b>And I just couldn't pull myself together.</b>

601
00:36:34,538 --> 00:36:35,497
<b>How's Dad?</b>

602
00:36:36,915 --> 00:36:38,208
<b>Is he doing all right?</b>

603
00:36:39,168 --> 00:36:40,336
<b>Well, you know.</b>

604
00:36:43,964 --> 00:36:45,299
<b>He told me that you've been</b>

605
00:36:46,258 --> 00:36:48,344
<b>sending money monthly
to his inmate account.</b>

606
00:36:51,472 --> 00:36:52,306
<b>Mom.</b>

607
00:36:54,141 --> 00:36:55,893
<b>Were you happy when I woke up?</b>

608
00:36:55,976 --> 00:36:57,728
<b>Gosh, of course.</b>

609
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:59,521
<b>Your dad and I thought we'd lose you.</b>

610
00:36:59,647 --> 00:37:02,566
<b>That one year when you were in a coma
was hell for us.</b>

611
00:37:03,317 --> 00:37:06,820
<b>Gosh, thinking about that time
still makes my heart pound.</b>

612
00:37:10,574 --> 00:37:11,575
<b>I felt the same way.</b>

613
00:37:14,161 --> 00:37:15,245
<b>When I woke up,</b>

614
00:37:16,955 --> 00:37:18,374

<b>Will your life end the same way as he did?</b>

769
00:50:18,695 --> 00:50:21,322
<b>You must be one of those
who stood on my father's blood.</b>

770
00:50:31,875 --> 00:50:34,711
<b>And you came here
as a compensation for that bloodbath?</b>

771
00:50:34,878 --> 00:50:36,963
<b>That is called balance.</b>

772
00:50:37,297 --> 00:50:39,007
<b>It is reasonable and fair.</b>

773
00:50:40,175 --> 00:50:44,179
<b>You were lucky enough to be born
with everything,</b>

774
00:50:44,262 --> 00:50:46,723
<b>so don't whine about losing your father.</b>

775
00:50:47,474 --> 00:50:48,433
<b>Yeong.</b>

776
00:50:56,399 --> 00:50:58,401
<b>Only God can restore that "balance."</b>

777
00:51:00,278 --> 00:51:01,446
<b>What you scoundrels are doing</b>

778
00:51:03,239 --> 00:51:04,324
<b>is murder.</b>

779
00:51:05,617 --> 00:51:06,493
<b>Remember that.</b>

780
00:51:07,202 --> 00:51:08,953
<b>Take him back to the Kingdom of Corea.</b>

781
00:51:09,829 --> 00:51:10,955
<b>Kill me.</b>

782
00:51:12,248 --> 00:51:15,251
<b>Just kill me!</b>

783
00:51:22,050 --> 00:51:24,260
<b>There are no numbers saved on this phone.</b>

784
00:51:25,261 --> 00:51:26,638
<b>I suppose this is just for</b>

785
00:51:28,097 --> 00:51:29,974
<b>answering the calls
that you are waiting for.</b>

786
00:51:31,559 --> 00:51:34,229
<b>That means I can answer
at least one phone call.</b>

787
00:51:37,565 --> 00:51:39,108
<b>Take your own life.</b>

788
00:51:41,402 --> 00:51:42,737
<b>It is a suicide order.</b>

789
00:51:45,782 --> 00:51:47,325
<b>Inmate 1834, you have a visitor.</b>

790
00:51:56,042 --> 00:51:56,918
<b>What's going on?</b>

791
00:51:57,001 --> 00:51:58,336
<b>Just follow me.</b>

792
00:52:39,877 --> 00:52:41,045
<b>Why did you turn yourself in?</b>

793
00:52:41,129 --> 00:52:42,797
<b>You came to see me because of that.</b>

794
00:52:43,298 --> 00:52:44,799
<b>I had no other choice.</b>

795
00:52:45,758 --> 00:52:47,969
<b>You drew the line,
and I had nowhere to hide.</b>

796
00:52:48,303 --> 00:52:49,220
<b>What else could I do?</b>

797
00:52:49,804 --> 00:52:50,680
<b>Where's the phone?</b>

798
00:52:52,932 --> 00:52:54,392
<b>I already canceled the service,</b>

799
00:52:54,851 --> 00:52:56,060
<b>but I need the phone back.</b>

800
00:52:56,394 --> 00:52:59,063
<b>I hid it in a safe place, of course.
It's my only hope.</b>

801
00:53:01,149 --> 00:53:02,275
<b>When will you get me out?</b>

802
00:53:02,859 --> 00:53:03,860
<b>Where did you hide it?</b>

803
00:53:04,944 --> 00:53:06,154
<b>It's a secret.</b>

804
00:53:07,071 --> 00:53:08,531
<b>When can I go over to the other side?</b>

805
00:53:08,615 --> 00:53:12,368
<b>Jeez. You shouldn't have killed anyone
if you'd wanted to go there.</b>

806
00:53:12,952 --> 00:53:14,537
<b>That too, I had no other choice.</b>

807
00:53:16,039 --> 00:53:16,873
<b>Eun-mi</b>

808
00:53:17,457 --> 00:53:18,750
<b>overheard the phone conversation.</b>

809
00:53:21,044 --> 00:53:23,713
<b>You'd better get me out quickly
before I hand it over to the cops.</b>

810
00:53:24,547 --> 00:53:25,548
<b>You can get me out, right?</b>

811
00:53:30,428 --> 00:53:31,512
<b>I'm just curious.</b>

812
00:53:33,473 --> 00:53:35,892
<b>Have you ever heard of a power outage
at a detention center?</b>

813
00:53:37,352 --> 00:53:38,269
<b>What</b>

814
00:53:39,145 --> 00:53:40,104
<b>do you mean?</b>

815
00:53:43,149 --> 00:53:44,609
<b>This isn't a power outage?</b>

816
00:53:53,451 --> 00:53:55,703
<b>I can switch it off and on
whenever it's necessary.</b>

817
00:53:56,829 --> 00:53:57,872
<b>Whatever it may be.</b>

818
00:53:59,582 --> 00:54:00,625
<b>Click.</b>

819
00:54:04,170 --> 00:54:05,254
<b>Try to remember</b>

820
00:54:06,798 --> 00:54:08,466
<b>where you hid the 2G phone.</b>

821
00:54:09,801 --> 00:54:11,344
<b>Call me when you remember where it is.</b>

822
00:54:33,282 --> 00:54:35,326
<b>I wish to rent your building
for a little while.</b>

823
00:54:35,785 --> 00:54:36,786
<b>Thank you for your help.</b>

824
00:54:37,870 --> 00:54:40,039
<b>Let me know if it's not enough.
If it's more than enough,</b>

825
00:54:41,124 --> 00:54:42,375
<b>can I get one of these?</b>

826
00:54:42,625 --> 00:54:43,793
<b>Jeez.</b>

827
00:54:45,586 --> 00:54:47,755
<b>I'll gladly give you two cups of it.</b>

828
00:54:48,423 --> 00:54:49,924
<b>You know the real estate trends.</b>

829
00:54:53,052 --> 00:54:54,178
<b>Looks like you'll need two.</b>

830
00:54:54,846 --> 00:54:55,930
<b>Tae-eul is here.</b>

831
00:55:07,984 --> 00:55:09,026
<b>Did the stakeout go well?</b>

832
00:55:10,236 --> 00:55:11,863
<b>I heard you caught the culprit too.</b>

833
00:55:13,656 --> 00:55:14,490
<b>No way.</b>

834
00:55:14,907 --> 00:55:16,325
<b>Did you have Jo Yeong tail me again?</b>

835
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:20,830
<b>Yes, just briefly though.</b>

836
00:55:21,998 --> 00:55:23,708
<b>But he can't do it anymore
as he's busy now.</b>

837
00:55:24,208 --> 00:55:26,210
<b>So make sure that buddy of yours
always tags along.</b>

838
00:55:26,794 --> 00:55:27,879
<b>This was a big decision.</b>

839
00:55:28,921 --> 00:55:31,174
<b>You think I'm being like this
because you had him tail me?</b>

840
00:55:31,591 --> 00:55:32,467
<b>Isn't it?</b>

841
00:55:33,092 --> 00:55:35,762
<b>You should've done it yourself.
Why send someone else?</b>

842
00:55:39,015 --> 00:55:40,349
<b>That would be nice,</b>

843
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:42,226
<b>but I'm not good at hiding.</b>

844
00:55:42,894 --> 00:55:44,103
<b>I stand out wherever I go.</b>

845
00:55:44,854 --> 00:55:47,982
<b>I light up a room just by walking into it.
It should be happening now too.</b>

846
00:55:48,357 --> 00:55:51,152
<b>Na-ri, is it still not ready?
Hurry up. I want a cold drink.</b>

847
00:55:51,235 --> 00:55:52,653
<b>Here are your drinks.</b>

848
00:55:54,781 --> 00:55:56,908
<b>First, just try it without stirring it.</b>

849
00:55:56,991 --> 00:55:59,410
<b>Experience the delicious sweetness,
and then stir it.</b>

850
00:56:01,037 --> 00:56:04,290
<b>Although I can see that there's already
too much sweetness going on here.</b>

851
00:56:07,001 --> 00:56:08,252
<b>Hey, take some <i>japchae</i> home.</b>

852
00:56:10,254 --> 00:56:12,965
<b>Why isn't Eun-sup coming for his <i>japchae</i>?
The noodles will swell up.</b>

853
00:56:14,967 --> 00:56:16,844
<b>I figured out something quite important.</b>

854
00:56:17,970 --> 00:56:19,931
<b>I think she has feelings for Eun-sup.</b>

855
00:56:21,933 --> 00:56:22,934
<b>You got it all wrong.</b>

856
00:56:23,434 --> 00:56:25,686
<b>Eun-sup has a crush on her.</b>

857
00:56:26,729 --> 00:56:27,605
<b>No way.</b>

858
00:56:27,688 --> 00:56:30,900
<b>Gosh, you're so slow-witted.
I don't think we can work together.</b>

859
00:56:36,823 --> 00:56:38,324
<b>I looked into this.</b>

860
00:56:39,116 --> 00:56:40,451
<b>His name is Lee Seong-jae.</b>

861
00:56:41,285 --> 00:56:43,955
<b>He died in 1995 at a care center.</b>

862
00:56:45,164 --> 00:56:48,376
<b>That's where he was last seen,
but there are no records.</b>

863
00:56:49,585 --> 00:56:51,712
<b>And he supposedly died a natural death.</b>

864
00:56:51,796 --> 00:56:53,172
<b>Did he have poliomyelitis?</b>

865
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:54,841
<b>Yes, he did.</b>

866
00:56:55,550 --> 00:56:56,634
<b>Did he have a family?</b>

867
00:57:02,181 --> 00:57:03,182
<b>Do I exist</b>

868
00:57:04,350 --> 00:57:05,226
<b>in this world?</b>

869
00:57:12,775 --> 00:57:13,860
<b>No, not anymore.</b>

870
00:57:14,610 --> 00:57:16,112
<b>He died when he was eight.</b>

871
00:57:18,739 --> 00:57:20,366
<b>So he first killed himself</b>

872
00:57:22,076 --> 00:57:23,160
<b>and then killed me.</b>

873
00:57:25,788 --> 00:57:26,789
<b>Any other family members?</b>

874
00:57:27,331 --> 00:57:30,209
<b>A brother or sister-in-law, for instance.</b>

875
00:57:31,377 --> 00:57:33,004
<b>His younger brother also died.</b>

876
00:57:33,671 --> 00:57:35,047
<b>But that brother's wife...</b>

877
00:57:36,841 --> 00:57:37,842
<b>She's still alive.</b>

878
00:57:47,685 --> 00:57:48,519
<b>Are you all right?</b>

879
00:57:49,896 --> 00:57:51,772
<b>If he and Lee Lim had
the same family members,</b>

880
00:57:53,149 --> 00:57:54,150
<b>then his sister-in-law</b>

881
00:57:55,526 --> 00:57:57,236
<b>would probably have my mother's face.</b>

882
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:01,866
<b>Her name is Song Jeong-hye.</b>

883
00:58:06,621 --> 00:58:07,872
<b>Are you free tomorrow afternoon?</b>

884
00:58:08,581 --> 00:58:10,708
<b>I'm planning to visit her address.</b>

885
00:58:11,417 --> 00:58:12,501
<b>You must cooperate.</b>

886
00:58:14,545 --> 00:58:15,546
<b>I am at your command.</b>

887
00:58:23,888 --> 00:58:24,847
<b>You were right.</b>

888
00:58:25,598 --> 00:58:26,515
<b>About what?</b>

889
00:58:27,224 --> 00:58:29,101
<b>That part of the room looks so bright.</b>

890
00:58:54,627 --> 00:58:55,670
<i><b>Father...</i></b>

891
00:58:55,753 --> 00:58:57,505
<i><b>After his coronation, King Lee Gon</i></b>

892
00:58:57,588 --> 00:59:00,216
<i><b>began his first duty as King,
mourning his father's death for 26 days</i></b>

893
00:59:00,299 --> 00:59:02,093
<i><b>according to court laws.</i></b>

894
01:00:01,318 --> 01:00:03,404
<b>That man came by, looking for Ji-hun.</b>

895
01:00:05,906 --> 01:00:07,616
<b>I guess we'll finally get busted.</b>

896
01:00:15,583 --> 01:00:17,126
<b>Is he Ji-hun's friend?</b>

897
01:00:18,210 --> 01:00:20,254
<b>He seems to be around Ji-hun's age,
you know.</b>

898
01:00:24,175 --> 01:00:25,134
<b>You can report it.</b>

899
01:00:26,052 --> 01:00:27,094
<b>I don't care.</b>

900
01:00:31,348 --> 01:00:32,725
<b>I won't die anyway.</b>

901
01:00:36,812 --> 01:00:37,688
<b>I can't die.</b>

902
01:00:39,565 --> 01:00:41,484
<b>You people will bring me
back to life again.</b>

903
01:01:05,466 --> 01:01:08,594
<i><b>Let's go home, Let's go home. Go home, go!</i></b>

904
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:11,555
<i><b>I want to go home, home, home.</i></b>

905
01:01:18,062 --> 01:01:20,481
<b>What? I didn't know you were there.</b>

906
01:01:21,649 --> 01:01:23,692
<b>Gosh, I just wanted to wear his coat.</b>

907
01:01:28,614 --> 01:01:31,826
<b>Wow, I look great.</b>

908
01:01:33,869 --> 01:01:37,081
<b>Oh, come on. What is this?
A picture with his boss as the wallpaper?</b>

909
01:01:37,164 --> 01:01:40,417
<b>Jeez, this nutcase. Is he on something?
Something is definitely wrong with him.</b>

910
01:01:40,501 --> 01:01:41,502
<b>Who?</b>

911
01:01:42,294 --> 01:01:44,171
<b>Gosh, you scared me.</b>

912
01:01:44,255 --> 01:01:45,506
<b>Hey, Sin-jae!</b>

913
01:01:45,673 --> 01:01:48,384
<b>-Leaving for the day?
-Yes, 6 p.m. on the dot.</b>

914
01:01:48,467 --> 01:01:49,844
<b>I'm leaving right on time today.</b>

915
01:01:49,927 --> 01:01:51,387
<b>And tomorrow, I'll be done for good!</b>

916
01:01:51,762 --> 01:01:52,805
<b>You're discharged tomorrow.</b>

917
01:01:52,888 --> 01:01:54,014
<b>-Yes.
-Congratulations.</b>

918
01:01:54,098 --> 01:01:55,224
<b>Hand that phone over.</b>

919
01:01:59,812 --> 01:02:00,771
<b>The phone?</b>

920
01:02:01,897 --> 01:02:04,108
<b>Why? It's my new phone.</b>

921
01:02:04,191 --> 01:02:05,693
