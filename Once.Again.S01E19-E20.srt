1
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:10,970
Actually, I...

2
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:17,509
Na Hee!

3
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:29,160
Darn it. You almost hit a person!

4
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:37,670
Gyu Jin, are you all right?

5
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:39,715
Yes, of course.

6
00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:40,846
(Episode 19)

7
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:42,445
- My foot.
- What? What is it?

8
00:00:42,469 --> 00:00:44,310
My foot. You're...

9
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:47,340
Darn it. Gosh, I'm sorry.

10
00:00:51,049 --> 00:00:53,350
I don't see anything wrong
on the X-ray.

11
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:57,219
How can it hurt
when nothing's wrong?

12
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:58,549
Are you sure?

13
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:00,490
Well...

14
00:01:01,259 --> 00:01:02,835
Your bones and ligaments are fine,

15
00:01:02,859 --> 00:01:04,429
but your muscles must be in shock.

16
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:07,705
It'll probably hurt
for a few days or so.

17
00:01:07,729 --> 00:01:10,170
How did you end up tripping though?

18
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,670
You just said that
Na Hee and Gyu Jin are divorced.

19
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:19,140
What? Well... Did I?

20
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:21,780
I wonder why I said that.

21
00:01:21,909 --> 00:01:24,956
Mr. Yoon, look into my eyes
and answer me.

22
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:26,620
It's what you said.

23
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:27,756
You got stuck living with her...

24
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,795
so that you can keep
your brother's divorce a secret.

25
00:01:29,819 --> 00:01:32,325
Your brother is
my brother-in-law...

26
00:01:32,349 --> 00:01:34,766
and your sister-in-law is my sister.

27
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:35,890
Right?

28
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:41,430
What makes you think
I only have one brother?

29
00:01:41,859 --> 00:01:45,915
Just so you know,
our family has a tragic secret...

30
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:48,599
regarding my siblings...

31
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,709
Okay, fine. I'll tell you.
It's already spilled milk anyway.

32
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:02,689
You're right. They got a divorce.

33
00:02:05,349 --> 00:02:06,790
Gosh.

34
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:09,930
I don't even know where to begin.

35
00:02:10,489 --> 00:02:12,799
It's true that they got divorced,

36
00:02:12,859 --> 00:02:14,730
but they're still living together...

37
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,230
because they couldn't
sell the house.

38
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:18,945
They're keeping it a secret
from the families...

39
00:02:18,969 --> 00:02:20,689
and will tell them
when it's the right time.

40
00:02:21,139 --> 00:02:25,169
This is absolutely insane!
How are they going to explain this?

41
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:28,939
That's what I thought at first,

42
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:32,325
but there's nothing in this world
that doesn't make sense.

43
00:02:32,349 --> 00:02:35,020
A lot of things can happen.

44
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:36,449
Not for my sister!

45
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,620
She's the most shrewd person I know.

46
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:42,295
She doesn't do anything
that doesn't make sense.

47
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:45,135
What are you yelling at me for?
I'm not the one who got a divorce.

48
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:49,129
I just don't get it, that's all.
Why would they keep it a secret?

49
00:02:49,729 --> 00:02:51,506
When did this even happen?

50
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:53,800
I don't know the exact date,

51
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,746
but it's around the time
I came back to Korea.

52
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:57,270
So I guess a month and a half ago.

53
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:02,039
Then it's my fault.

54
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,310
What? What do you mean?

55
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:08,780
It's my fault.

56
00:03:09,819 --> 00:03:12,990
She couldn't say anything
because of my annulment.

57
00:03:13,189 --> 00:03:15,336
My parents were already in shock,

58
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,590
so she couldn't add to their stress.

59
00:03:18,889 --> 00:03:22,436
The timing just wasn't right.
It's not your fault at all.

60
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:23,776
Don't be like that.

61
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,139
It's not like you caused
their divorce or anything.

62
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,469
Still...

63
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:31,439
This is absurd. Na Hee too?

64
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,110
My mom will be in shock.

65
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:39,210
Why don't we give Gyu Jin
and Na Hee some time?

66
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:40,849
I think that'll be better.

67
00:03:46,419 --> 00:03:47,460
Ms. Song,

68
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,990
forget everything I told you today.

69
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,759
Just forget it all.

70
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:56,806
Don't look at me like that.
You're making me nervous.

71
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:59,205
Gyu Jin will kill me
if he finds out I spilled the beans.

72
00:03:59,229 --> 00:04:02,000
You have no idea how scary he can be
when he's furious.

73
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:05,610
Got it? Come on...

74
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:08,915
Okay, fine. I'll try and forget it.

75
00:04:08,939 --> 00:04:11,126
- Forget what?
- Na Hee and Gyu Jin's divorce...

76
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:13,180
Stop! I told you to forget.

77
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,250
Okay, fine.

78
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:17,449
Promise me.

79
00:04:18,419 --> 00:04:19,520
Come on.

80
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:25,189
You are not to tell a single soul.
Got it?

81
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,459
Seal the deal.

82
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,800
Finalize it.

83
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:31,899
Now copy the contract.

84
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:33,870
Laminate.

85
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,586
This is as good as
any bullet-proof deal.

86
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:40,040
You must keep it a secret.

87
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:53,689
Is Na Hee's show on tomorrow?
At what time?

88
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,266
It's 10:30 a.m. at KBN.

89
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:56,860
You memorized it so much...

90
00:04:56,889 --> 00:04:58,466
that the answer just
popped right out of you.

91
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:00,206
Of course she's excited.

92
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:02,100
All the people in the market
will watch.

93
00:05:02,529 --> 00:05:06,315
Mom, it's been a while
since you enjoyed a proud moment.

94
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:08,245
Of course.
This is more than just a big deal.

95
00:05:08,269 --> 00:05:10,670
Someone in our family
is on TV for the first time.

96
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:12,956
That's not true.
I've been on TV too.

97
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:15,086
It was the back of your head,
so it doesn't count.

98
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:17,125
Your character died in seconds.

99
00:05:17,149 --> 00:05:19,656
You said you never watched
the show I was on.

100
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,220
I guess you did.

101
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:25,189
It was only in passing, okay?

102
00:05:32,129 --> 00:05:34,930
Today's training has exhausted me.

103
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:37,529
I'm calling it a night.

104
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,476
Why are you taking that?
To eat some more?

105
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,615
What? Well, I've been
getting hungry at night.

106
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,439
There must be a few beggars
living in my stomach.

107
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,550
You're not entirely wrong.
They're just not in your stomach.

108
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:53,550
What do you mean by that?

109
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:58,420
It's nothing.
I was only talking to myself.

110
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:00,060
Good night then, Joon Seon.

111
00:06:00,089 --> 00:06:01,220
Night.

112
00:06:06,829 --> 00:06:09,875
Ok Ja, are you all right?

113
00:06:09,899 --> 00:06:12,129
You've been spacing out all evening.

114
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:15,675
What? What do you mean?
I'm fine, you know.

115
00:06:15,699 --> 00:06:18,040
I'm perfectly fine.

116
00:06:19,269 --> 00:06:21,779
Auntie, what are you doing?

117
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,149
Goodness.

118
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:25,410
- Here you go.
- Gosh.

119
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,990
Oh, of course.
No wonder it hurt my teeth.

120
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:47,569
No, this is wrong.

121
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,915
Calm down, my beating heart.

122
00:06:50,939 --> 00:06:52,470
Not that jerk.

123
00:06:53,509 --> 00:06:57,509
This is insane. You're crazy.

124
00:06:58,310 --> 00:06:59,579
You've lost it!

125
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:06,120
Ok Ja, are you going somewhere?

126
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:10,889
I need some fresh air
before going home.

127
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,735
Not caring about
my health these days...

128
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:17,129
must've led to angina.

129
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,146
I'll get going then.
See you tomorrow.

130
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:21,100
- Sure, good night.
- Goodnight, Auntie.

131
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,740
- My gosh.
- Auntie, are you leaving? Bye!

132
00:07:25,339 --> 00:07:27,555
- I'm home.
- Da Hee, you're home.

133
00:07:27,579 --> 00:07:29,509
- Dinner?
- I grabbed a bite to eat.

134
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,586
- I'll get changed first.
- Sure thing.

135
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:32,949
Hurry on out for some chicken.

136
00:07:38,149 --> 00:07:40,065
They agreed to be on TV together
after getting a divorce?

137
00:07:40,089 --> 00:07:41,189
Unbelievable.

138
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,230
(Na Hee)

139
00:07:49,529 --> 00:07:52,605
Gyu Jin will kill me if he
finds out I spilled the beans.

140
00:07:52,629 --> 00:07:53,939
You must keep it a secret.

141
00:07:56,069 --> 00:07:57,310
You've got to be kidding me.

142
00:07:58,209 --> 00:08:00,839
Na Hee, what are you going to do?

143
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,920
I wonder if they got
a face massage in advance.

144
00:08:11,649 --> 00:08:15,189
I'm glad your brother takes after me
and my great skin.

145
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:19,406
I blame my darn big mouth.

146
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:23,005
What on earth are you doing?

147
00:08:23,029 --> 00:08:26,899
Nothing, Mom.
I'm annoyed with my big mouth.

148
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:29,685
There's nothing wrong
with your lips.

149
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:31,670
I, for one,
think they're nice and plump.

150
00:08:31,709 --> 00:08:33,310
Of course my mouth is good looking.

151
00:08:33,339 --> 00:08:34,915
This is more about
how I never think before talking.

152
00:08:34,939 --> 00:08:35,916
What do you mean?

153
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:38,079
You're better off not knowing.

154
00:08:38,779 --> 00:08:42,155
Why did I have to take after
your big mouth too?

155
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:45,196
The apple never falls far
from the tree, does it?

156
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:47,289
Blaming me is a habit of yours now,
isn't it?

157
00:08:48,019 --> 00:08:51,129
You dismiss me as if I'm your peer!

158
00:08:52,129 --> 00:08:53,730
Are you kidding me?

159
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:57,429
See what I mean?
My big mouth deserved that!

160
00:08:57,629 --> 00:08:58,830
Darn it.

161
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,470
Why? What now?

162
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:06,556
You did it on purpose, didn't you?

163
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:09,279
What? How can you even...

164
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:13,956
Sure. I hired someone to almost
hit you with a motorcycle...

165
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:16,220
so that I could push you. Happy now?

166
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,720
Is this what I get for saving you?

167
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,490
You call this "saving"?

168
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:28,535
Things happened so fast
that I couldn't help it.

169
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:31,946
I would've dodged the motorcycle
just fine, you know.

170
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:33,145
You always overreact.

171
00:09:33,169 --> 00:09:38,046
Everyone knows that
you're slow in your movements.

172
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:39,909
You wouldn't have dodged anything.

173
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:43,210
I was so shocked
that I acted without thinking!

174
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:52,166
Well, it's because
I have a strong sense of justice...

175
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:55,059
and I'm chivalrous.

176
00:09:55,559 --> 00:09:57,360
Chivalrous, my foot.

177
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:03,000
What about you then?
Why didn't you see the bike coming?

178
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:06,176
It's not like I didn't see it.

179
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:09,139
You were busy looking
at your phone, weren't you?

180
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:15,379
Haven't you tripped at work enough
from doing that?

181
00:10:15,809 --> 00:10:18,355
You just never learn.

182
00:10:18,379 --> 00:10:20,480
Is your brain only smart
when it comes to academics?

183
00:10:21,049 --> 00:10:24,490
Stop nagging me already.
You're not my husband, you know.

184
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:25,590
That's enough.

185
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:30,535
I say this as your colleague.
Get a hot pack on that.

186
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:31,730
What's it to you?

187
00:10:32,929 --> 00:10:34,799
Fine. That's your loss anyway.

188
00:10:36,629 --> 00:10:39,169
Why did I have to overreact?

189
00:10:49,509 --> 00:10:50,610
Na Hee!

190
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:00,995
Who does he think he is?
My bodyguard?

191
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:02,159
What a joke.

192
00:11:08,529 --> 00:11:10,629
Isn't your room too cramped
for the three of you?

193
00:11:10,929 --> 00:11:12,070
It's not bad.

194
00:11:13,269 --> 00:11:15,029
How long are you
going to let them stay here?

195
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:17,070
You will eventually get caught.

196
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:20,539
Once you get caught,
you might have your head cut off.

197
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:22,385
I'll take care of it myself.
Just mind your own business.

198
00:11:22,409 --> 00:11:23,450
Yesterday...

199
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:27,470
Da Hee, are you going out already?

200
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,450
You seem tired.
Were you up all night?

201
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:32,720
I didn't sleep well.

202
00:11:32,789 --> 00:11:34,860
Why not? Is it hard to study?

203
00:11:35,019 --> 00:11:36,535
Don't feel pressured.

204
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:38,936
I'll make sure to send you abroad
to study if it doesn't go well here.

205
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,605
Where do you want to go? Australia?

206
00:11:40,629 --> 00:11:43,799
That's the type of thing
you always say.

207
00:11:44,129 --> 00:11:46,275
You should've made sure
to take good care of your family.

208
00:11:46,299 --> 00:11:49,275
Must you hit me
where it hurts like that?

209
00:11:49,299 --> 00:11:50,409
Well...

210
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:53,155
Ga Hee. Joon Seon.

211
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:54,909
- Yes?
- What? Do you have anything to say?

212
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:57,950
No. Nothing.

213
00:11:59,379 --> 00:12:01,350
Mom, I'm going out.

214
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,120
Wait, Da Hee.

215
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:04,895
Make sure to eat breakfast.

216
00:12:04,919 --> 00:12:06,659
I wish you had time to eat here.

217
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,365
And you know Na Hee will be
on TV today, right?

218
00:12:09,389 --> 00:12:12,429
Make sure to watch it
and send her a text message.

219
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:14,429
See you.

220
00:12:15,129 --> 00:12:16,405
- Bye.
- Bye.

221
00:12:16,429 --> 00:12:18,230
- See you.
- Are you leaving now?

222
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,870
- Work hard.
- Okay.

223
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:23,909
Did you check the water meter again?

224
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:26,285
Yes. It's just strange.

225
00:12:26,309 --> 00:12:27,755
The meter seems fine,

226
00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:31,379
but the numbers are
increasing quite fast.

227
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:34,450
We're not doing anything different.
I don't know what's wrong.

228
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:38,049
I'm sure there's nothing wrong.

229
00:12:38,289 --> 00:12:40,865
Gosh, you're unbelievable.

230
00:12:40,889 --> 00:12:44,836
Who else checks
the meter every morning?

231
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:46,700
You're helpless.

232
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:49,676
No. It's still strange.

233
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,570
Gosh, Dad. Where are you going?

234
00:12:51,769 --> 00:12:54,899
I want to go check if there's a leak
in the rooftop room.

235
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:58,385
There was a leak the other day,
so I guess that's what it is.

236
00:12:58,409 --> 00:12:59,645
No, Dad.

237
00:12:59,669 --> 00:13:01,385
I'm sure it's fine.

238
00:13:01,409 --> 00:13:02,539
How do you know that?

239
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:04,355
I've got the feeling.

240
00:13:04,379 --> 00:13:06,796
Gosh, don't be silly.

241
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,456
No, Dad. You can't go up there.

242
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,466
- Move over.
- No. Wait, Dad.

243
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:11,666
- Why?
- No.

244
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:12,667
Dad.

245
00:13:12,691 --> 00:13:13,990
It's...

246
00:13:14,659 --> 00:13:15,789
my doing.

247
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:18,090
What?

248
00:13:18,389 --> 00:13:19,529
Water.

249
00:13:19,929 --> 00:13:21,659
I'm the one who used it a lot.

250
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:26,306
I'm so into lower-body
bathing these days.

251
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:28,000
Lower-body bathing?

252
00:13:28,269 --> 00:13:32,240
Yes. I've been
feeling tired these days.

253
00:13:33,409 --> 00:13:34,785
I'm sorry, Dad.

254
00:13:34,809 --> 00:13:38,025
I see. They say jobless people
die from overwork.

255
00:13:38,049 --> 00:13:39,480
You're just like that.

256
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:41,456
What makes you so tired?

257
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:44,490
Are you tired from breathing
or eating free meals?

258
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,450
I know.

259
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:49,490
Am I suffering from spring fever?
Why do I feel so tired?

260
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:51,765
If you want to keep taking baths,

261
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:53,929
make sure to reuse the bathwater
for the toilet.

262
00:13:54,059 --> 00:13:57,169
If you don't want to,
go to a sauna with your own money.

263
00:13:57,230 --> 00:13:58,470
- Okay.
- Here.

264
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:01,669
I'm sorry, Dad. I will be careful.

265
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:30,169
Gosh, are you doing this on purpose
to make me feel sorry?

266
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:31,570
No, I'm not.

267
00:14:31,769 --> 00:14:33,899
I can tell you do feel sorry though.

268
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:41,879
All right. Fine.
You got hurt because of me.

269
00:14:41,909 --> 00:14:43,879
So I will give you a ride.

270
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,480
Forget it.

271
00:14:45,649 --> 00:14:46,956
Better to be
physically uncomfortable...

272
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,120
than feel uneasy.

273
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:50,620
Whatever. It's your loss.

274
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:58,990
Maybe I should've pretended
to give in and gotten a ride.

275
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:01,100
Dr. Song.

276
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,576
- Dr. Song.
- Hello, sir.

277
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,399
My dear Dr. Song.

278
00:15:07,299 --> 00:15:10,009
Why are you alone?
Where's Dr. Yoon?

279
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:11,816
I guess he went to buy something.

280
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,046
I see.

281
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:15,240
Your show will be aired today.

282
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,855
I told everyone
in the patient's rooms,

283
00:15:17,879 --> 00:15:20,019
waiting rooms, and staff lounges
to watch it.

284
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:22,080
You will watch it as well, right?

285
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,326
Yes. If I don't have
any patients to take care of.

286
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:27,159
What are you talking about?
You have to watch it.

287
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:31,389
Your body is innocent.

288
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:34,775
The real doctors argue about
which treatments are the best.

289
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:38,105
Let us introduce you
to our new panel of doctors.

290
00:15:38,129 --> 00:15:39,806
Here with us are the doctor couple
with great chemistry.

291
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:42,740
They are Pediatricians Yoon Gyu Jin
and Song Na Hee.

292
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:47,940
Thank you for joining us today.

293
00:15:48,139 --> 00:15:50,625
- You two are working...
- One Americano, please.

294
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:52,255
- At the same hospital together.
- Hush. I'm not taking orders now.

295
00:15:52,279 --> 00:15:53,649
Go somewhere else.

296
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:55,456
You two are like two love birds.

297
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,625
My gosh.

298
00:15:56,649 --> 00:15:59,820
It's an old TV,
but they still look great.

299
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:02,566
Hyo Sin, are you filming it right?

300
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:05,166
Yes. I will send the video
to your phones.

301
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:08,375
It's okay.
I just want to watch them like this.

302
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,005
They say those who make good dough
make good noodles.

303
00:16:12,029 --> 00:16:15,340
It's not like they are just smart.
They are good talkers too.

304
00:16:15,899 --> 00:16:17,970
Why were you dressed like that?

305
00:16:18,309 --> 00:16:22,485
You look much better
in bright colors.

306
00:16:22,509 --> 00:16:26,250
Na Hee was wearing colorful clothes.
Did she not even look after you?

307
00:16:26,779 --> 00:16:29,495
I'm the one who picked it.
That's what I like.

308
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:33,296
And why would she talk
back to you every single time?

309
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,166
She was on TV
for a longer period of time.

310
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:38,765
That's just because
she speaks better than me.

311
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:40,035
That's not true.

312
00:16:40,059 --> 00:16:42,135
It's just that you are modest...

313
00:16:42,159 --> 00:16:44,929
while she's such a show-off.

314
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:47,275
If she's like that again next week,
I won't let it slide.

315
00:16:47,299 --> 00:16:49,870
Gosh, Mom. Please.

316
00:16:51,309 --> 00:16:53,679
Oh, my.
I'm getting a call from a friend.

317
00:16:54,009 --> 00:16:55,539
I bet she watched the show. Bye.

318
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:02,350
My goodness.
I guess a TV show is a big deal.

319
00:17:06,149 --> 00:17:09,365
It seems the TV show
is very popular.

320
00:17:09,389 --> 00:17:11,865
There's no one around me
who didn't watch it.

321
00:17:11,889 --> 00:17:14,275
They are all jealous
that I have a daughter...

322
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:15,900
and son-in-law like you guys.

323
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:19,269
Na Hee, I enjoyed the show.
You looked pretty.

324
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:23,216
Your dad didn't say much,
but he seemed happy.

325
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,940
He even gave out
more chicken to the customers.

326
00:17:26,609 --> 00:17:28,856
You know that doesn't happen a lot,
don't you?

327
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,980
Mom, I have to get back to work.

328
00:17:32,779 --> 00:17:34,295
Okay, right.

329
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:36,426
I'm sorry. Go ahead and work.

330
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:38,990
Tell Gyu Jin
that I really enjoyed it.

331
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:41,920
Okay. Bye.

332
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:46,960
Is she that happy?

333
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:50,130
Her voice sounds so bright.

334
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,926
Ok Boon, I watched the TV show.

335
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:05,650
Your daughter is so lovely.

336
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:06,980
Did you watch it?

337
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:09,049
Thanks.

338
00:18:13,049 --> 00:18:14,495
I watched it too.

339
00:18:14,519 --> 00:18:17,035
Your son-in-law is so handsome.
He has such big eyes.

340
00:18:17,059 --> 00:18:20,599
Gosh, how did you manage to watch it
when you're so busy?

341
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:24,470
I guess my daughter
has an eye for men.

342
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:25,900
Thank you anyway.

343
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:28,976
You must be happy, Ms. Jang.

344
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,386
Your daughter and son-in-law
are so famous.

345
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:33,315
Gosh, they are not that famous.

346
00:18:33,339 --> 00:18:35,380
They were just on TV.
It's no big deal.

347
00:18:35,809 --> 00:18:37,809
Thank you anyway.

348
00:18:41,819 --> 00:18:42,880
Here.

349
00:18:43,849 --> 00:18:46,095
Where have you been?
We're busy here.

350
00:18:46,119 --> 00:18:48,595
I'm sorry.
I went to buy some green onions,

351
00:18:48,619 --> 00:18:50,706
but people kept talking to me.

352
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:52,606
Why did you buy green onions?
We have a lot in storage.

353
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:53,706
Really?

354
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:55,275
I had no idea.

355
00:18:55,299 --> 00:18:57,775
You are so tactless.

356
00:18:57,799 --> 00:19:01,400
She just went out
to brag about Na Hee.

357
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:03,000
That's not true, you brat.

358
00:19:04,839 --> 00:19:06,470
Yes, it is.

359
00:19:06,569 --> 00:19:09,216
You can fool a ghost, but not me.

360
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,485
I'm Jang Ok Ja.

361
00:19:10,509 --> 00:19:13,380
I have the quickest of wits.

362
00:19:15,819 --> 00:19:17,626
- I brought chickens.
- Hey.

363
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:19,289
You're here.

364
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,906
Ok Boon, I watched the show.

365
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:27,730
Na Hee is the best.
She sounds so smart.

366
00:19:28,329 --> 00:19:30,599
You're too kind.
Anyone can do that...

367
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:32,200
in front of the camera.

368
00:19:32,269 --> 00:19:35,240
Why would you say something
you don't even mean?

369
00:19:35,339 --> 00:19:36,845
How many chickens did you bring?

370
00:19:36,869 --> 00:19:38,309
I brought 20 for now.

371
00:19:38,369 --> 00:19:41,240
The weather is getting hot.

372
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,140
It's steaming hot.

373
00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:44,809
My goodness.

374
00:20:11,269 --> 00:20:12,339
Well...

375
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:16,410
Would you like me to help you?
It must be hard.

376
00:20:19,579 --> 00:20:20,779
Smoothly.

377
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:31,730
The other way.

378
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:35,400
Smoothly.

379
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:39,700
Go ahead and feel Chi Su's touch.

380
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:46,980
Ok Ja.

381
00:20:47,539 --> 00:20:48,579
Are you asleep?

382
00:20:49,009 --> 00:20:50,140
Are you sleeping?

383
00:20:50,609 --> 00:20:52,380
You should go home
if you want to sleep.

384
00:20:55,319 --> 00:20:57,966
You're ruining my eyes.

385
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:59,866
Do you think you're in your 20s?

386
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:01,666
That's just ugly.

387
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:03,706
You should try carrying around
heavy heaps of meat.

388
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:05,805
I'd strip down to my shorts
in this weather.

389
00:21:05,829 --> 00:21:09,160
My gosh,
what on earth are you saying?

390
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,900
I should get going before
I get another earful from you.

391
00:21:13,299 --> 00:21:15,345
- See you later, Young Dal.
- Okay.

392
00:21:15,369 --> 00:21:16,515
See you, Ok Boon!

393
00:21:16,539 --> 00:21:18,970
Why not have a cold cereal smoothie?

394
00:21:21,009 --> 00:21:24,410
Why do you keep chasing him off?
Do you enjoy doing that?

395
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,279
Yes, I just love it.
So what? What's wrong?

396
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:30,619
That's not what I wanted.

397
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:32,890
I wish he'd stay longer.

398
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:34,990
Darn it.

399
00:21:35,559 --> 00:21:38,230
Hi, Seon Ja. What's the occasion?

400
00:21:39,029 --> 00:21:40,930
My gosh, you saw the show?

401
00:21:41,259 --> 00:21:46,470
Yes, yes, that's my second daughter
and my son-in-law.

402
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:51,446
Don't congratulate me.
It's nothing at all.

403
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:52,970
Oh, yes, yes.

404
00:21:53,170 --> 00:21:56,579
(Pediatric Dentistry)

405
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:58,980
Oh, Dr. Song.

406
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,150
- I enjoyed the show.
- Right.

407
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:02,495
You're awesome.

408
00:22:02,519 --> 00:22:03,549
Right.

409
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:05,726
Dr. Song, I saw you on TV.

410
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:08,535
Me too.
Can I get an autograph later?

411
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:10,960
- Me too.
- Sure. Thank you.

412
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:17,799
All this after just one show?
What a nuisance.

413
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:21,876
My gosh.

414
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:24,210
You scared me! Darn you.

415
00:22:25,269 --> 00:22:27,356
What were you doing in here?

416
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:29,509
Can't you tell? I was resting.

417
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:34,396
My department is full of patients...

418
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:37,890
and everywhere I go,
people make a fuss about the show.

419
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,589
I needed some time alone.

420
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:44,329
I feel the same.
This won't go on, will it?

421
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:48,400
I don't know.

422
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:51,200
I didn't know people watch
so much TV.

423
00:22:51,529 --> 00:22:55,039
We could end up
conning the whole country.

424
00:22:55,839 --> 00:22:59,440
Wow, you sound afraid.
Are you feeling weak?

425
00:23:00,509 --> 00:23:03,809
Don't pretend to be brave.
You're just as scared.

426
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:08,119
- Gosh...
- Goodness gracious.

427
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:12,190
I said I'd give you a ride.
Your pride does you no good.

428
00:23:12,289 --> 00:23:14,819
Don't pick on me.
I have no strength to fight back.

429
00:23:16,289 --> 00:23:19,466
Ask me for a lift after work.

430
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:22,406
If you plead nicely,
I might be willing to help.

431
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:23,745
No thanks.

432
00:23:23,769 --> 00:23:26,206
I might think about it
if you beg me to ride with you.

433
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:28,599
Why would I do that? Dream on.

434
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,045
Same here.

435
00:23:30,069 --> 00:23:31,416
Why would I ask
for such an uncomfortable ride?

436
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,569
My gosh.

437
00:23:34,309 --> 00:23:36,880
Hey. What are you two
doing in my hideout?

438
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:39,380
- This was my...
- This was my hideout...

439
00:23:40,779 --> 00:23:42,349
You two, in here?

440
00:23:42,849 --> 00:23:45,920
Oh, that's what you two got up to?

441
00:23:48,519 --> 00:23:51,565
I was just about to leave.
You brothers can rest.

442
00:23:51,589 --> 00:23:53,490
Okay. Get back to work.

443
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,406
Here's your almost-large medium.

444
00:23:57,430 --> 00:23:58,500
- Thank you.
- Bye.

445
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:02,400
Yes, of course.
Call me when you're next in Seoul.

446
00:24:02,839 --> 00:24:05,315
You've been talking for hours.

447
00:24:05,339 --> 00:24:07,985
Your phone bill will cost
more than the kids' pay.

448
00:24:08,009 --> 00:24:10,309
I've only been taking calls.

449
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:13,656
Just one appearance on TV...

450
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:17,025
and people who never used to call me
are calling me.

451
00:24:17,049 --> 00:24:18,265
Hey, Ok Ja.

452
00:24:18,289 --> 00:24:21,436
Do you remember
Ms. Young Hee's daughter Eun Sook?

453
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,735
That brat.

454
00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:26,866
She looked down on me
for selling chicken in a market,

455
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:29,960
and even she called
to brown-nose me.

456
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:33,000
This is why one must be successful.

457
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,416
- I'm back.
- Good job.

458
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,845
It's hard work, isn't it? Well done.

459
00:24:37,869 --> 00:24:40,285
It's fine. The customer paid cash.

460
00:24:40,309 --> 00:24:41,779
Okay, good job.

461
00:24:41,809 --> 00:24:43,216
You must be hungry.

462
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,926
I was too preoccupied
to bring lunch today.

463
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:48,025
You have to go out and eat.

464
00:24:48,049 --> 00:24:50,396
We can't leave the store unattended.

465
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:52,466
Let's take turns to eat.
You go first.

466
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:56,136
Me, me. I'll go and eat first.

467
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,706
Okay. You both can...

468
00:24:57,730 --> 00:25:02,559
No, I have to...
I'll go alone. I have to eat.

469
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,545
Hey, Ok Ja... What got into her?

470
00:25:05,569 --> 00:25:07,916
She can't stand hunger.

471
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:10,940
(Take-out available,
Delivery available)

472
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:19,950
(Chi Su's Butcher Shop)

473
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:38,930
My gosh. Oh, dear me.

474
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,039
My goodness.

475
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:02,589
I must be out of my mind.
Why is he so sexy?

476
00:26:36,519 --> 00:26:38,089
What's this about?

477
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:40,900
What do you want?

478
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:43,759
Is it this?

479
00:26:57,549 --> 00:26:59,779
Gosh, it's hot. Why am I so hot?

480
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:12,890
Who was that?
The village crazy lady?

481
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:20,299
It costs 30 dollars
to join the association?

482
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,745
We must sell 10 kimbap
to make that much.

483
00:27:22,769 --> 00:27:25,470
It's not like they do anything.

484
00:27:25,569 --> 00:27:29,210
Cho Yeon, don't you think
30 dollars is cheap?

485
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:31,549
We spend that on coffee in no time.

486
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:36,555
Eat the end bits,
not the perfectly long ones.

487
00:27:36,579 --> 00:27:38,366
There are some benefits.

488
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:40,866
They disinfect our stores regularly
and provide parking spaces.

489
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:42,466
Cho Yeon, look at this.

490
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:44,805
There's a sports dance class.
That's hilarious.

491
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:47,636
There's a class?
You're right, there is.

492
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:50,505
One during the day
and one in the evening. Okay.

493
00:27:50,529 --> 00:27:51,876
Why? Are you interested?

494
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:54,700
Of course. I paid the fee.
I shall reap the benefits.

495
00:27:54,769 --> 00:27:56,176
Come with me. Make it worthwhile.

496
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,485
No thanks.

497
00:27:57,509 --> 00:28:01,015
There will only be potbellied men
and chatty women.

498
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:03,456
Yes, Cho Yeon.
Our working environment here...

499
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,450
is just too desolate.

500
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:08,825
Do you miss the old days that much?

501
00:28:08,849 --> 00:28:11,426
After dealing with all those losers,

502
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:14,335
do you still miss men? Do you?

503
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:17,890
I can't stand
even thinking about men.

504
00:28:19,029 --> 00:28:20,130
Welcome.

505
00:28:20,259 --> 00:28:21,599
Can I eat here?

506
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,400
Yes.

507
00:28:26,930 --> 00:28:30,299
(Integrated Care Center)

508
00:28:33,309 --> 00:28:35,656
Good job, you two.

509
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,755
Wasn't it a long day? Good job.

510
00:28:37,779 --> 00:28:40,386
Is Dr. Song still working?

511
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:41,555
Yes.

512
00:28:41,579 --> 00:28:43,896
I think she'll be late.
She still has patients.

513
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,019
Oh, does she?

514
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:50,890
My gosh.

515
00:28:55,559 --> 00:28:57,259
Let's see...

516
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:03,676
He's an attacking midfielder.
Why put him on defense?

517
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:06,815
Come on, pass, pass. There you go.

518
00:29:06,839 --> 00:29:07,910
Shoot.

519
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:22,089
When does she finish?

520
00:29:26,259 --> 00:29:27,460
My gosh.

521
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:31,946
What?

522
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:35,240
You're in, good.
Help me. It's an emergency.

523
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,299
Why? What's the diagnosis?

524
00:29:40,339 --> 00:29:42,755
I'll see you next time.
The nurse will set an appointment.

525
00:29:42,779 --> 00:29:45,849
Thanks. I enjoyed your show, doctor.

526
00:29:46,109 --> 00:29:48,250
Okay, thank you. Bye.

527
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:54,490
What time is it?

528
00:29:55,259 --> 00:29:57,660
People are so susceptible to TV.

529
00:29:58,190 --> 00:30:00,390
How come I have double the patients?

530
00:30:15,509 --> 00:30:17,579
What? He left?

531
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:21,750
He acted as if he'd give me a lift.

532
00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:25,595
As if. I shouldn't have
expected anything from you.

533
00:30:25,619 --> 00:30:26,690
Forget it.

534
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:34,230
Why won't any taxis take my call?

535
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:36,799
(Calling for a taxi)

536
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,569
Are you leaving work?

537
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:45,916
Yes. What are you doing here?

538
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:48,839
I met the director
and had dinner nearby.

539
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,555
What's wrong with your foot?

540
00:30:50,579 --> 00:30:52,579
I sprained my ankle.

541
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:55,926
Did you? Get in. I'll take you home.

542
00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:57,795
No, I'll take a taxi.

543
00:30:57,819 --> 00:30:59,825
It's rush hour
and you'll never get one.

544
00:30:59,849 --> 00:31:02,019
Get in. You hurt your ankle.

545
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:03,890
Come on.

546
00:31:10,599 --> 00:31:13,376
I doubt it was easy
having dinner with the director.

547
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,470
Oh, right.

548
00:31:15,339 --> 00:31:16,769
He hasn't changed at all.

549
00:31:17,339 --> 00:31:18,970
I thought my ears
were going to bleed.

550
00:31:20,539 --> 00:31:22,386
You'll have to endure it
even more now.

551
00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:25,150
You know how he favors you the most.

552
00:31:25,849 --> 00:31:26,980
I know.

553
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:30,779
I was thinking about
asking him to lend me some money.

554
00:31:31,089 --> 00:31:33,019
Then he wouldn't
want to meet so often.

555
00:31:33,819 --> 00:31:36,359
How smart. I love the idea.

556
00:31:41,859 --> 00:31:45,000
So how did you sprain your ankle?
Did you trip?

557
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,369
No, it's just...

558
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:52,269
Gyu Jin should've
given you a lift home.

559
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:53,839
But I guess he had plans.

560
00:31:54,509 --> 00:31:57,309
It's not like
his ankle is hurt, right?

561
00:31:58,180 --> 00:31:59,809
That's nonchalant of you.

562
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:05,720
I was surprised at first
when I heard you two got married.

563
00:32:05,849 --> 00:32:07,366
You seemed like an odd couple.

564
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:08,460
How so?

565
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:10,690
I'm not sure,

566
00:32:10,789 --> 00:32:12,206
but when I first heard about it,

567
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:14,900
I was like, "What? Those two?"

568
00:32:16,329 --> 00:32:20,170
From what I remember,
you weren't exactly the dating type.

569
00:32:20,769 --> 00:32:24,710
I thought you'd live alone
without getting married.

570
00:32:27,609 --> 00:32:29,910
Do you know what
my first memory is of you?

571
00:32:31,809 --> 00:32:35,819
Remember how I was the TA
in your anatomy class?

572
00:32:37,049 --> 00:32:39,525
Blood was drained from
most of the students' faces...

573
00:32:39,549 --> 00:32:41,460
when they first saw a cadaver.

574
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:43,795
I offered to buy you
a meal afterward.

575
00:32:43,819 --> 00:32:45,960
Do you remember
what you said you wanted?

576
00:32:46,029 --> 00:32:47,160
I'm not sure.

577
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,329
Tripe!

578
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:53,545
I was amazed by
the strong stomach you have...

579
00:32:53,569 --> 00:32:55,569
and kept an eye on you
ever since then.

580
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:57,640
Is that so?

581
00:32:58,269 --> 00:33:01,710
So how is it that you never married?

582
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,480
I'm sure the ladies love you.

583
00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:07,079
I'm not sure.

584
00:33:07,349 --> 00:33:10,720
I never met anyone
who I wanted to marry, I guess.

585
00:33:12,349 --> 00:33:14,690
Set me up sometime
with someone decent.

586
00:33:15,019 --> 00:33:17,906
Someone as funny as you
would be a delight.

587
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:20,529
But I don't have any friends.
I'm an outcast, you see.

588
00:33:22,599 --> 00:33:25,176
Must you really throw punches...

589
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,000
at yourself like that?

590
00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:30,170
You're hilarious, you know.

591
00:33:30,839 --> 00:33:32,759
You don't have friends
because you're an outcast?

592
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:40,426
So will Mom and Dad be late today?

593
00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:42,079
Orders have been
piling in at night...

594
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:43,595
ever since they started
to make deliveries.

595
00:33:43,619 --> 00:33:45,025
Let me get you all some.

596
00:33:45,049 --> 00:33:47,819
This is for you, Ji Hun.
Seo Young, here you go.

597
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,990
And you, Seo Jin. Enjoy.

598
00:33:50,089 --> 00:33:51,106
Thanks, Mom.

599
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:52,759
Thanks, Auntie.

600
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:54,829
Is it good, guys?

601
00:33:54,930 --> 00:33:56,599
Yes, it's delicious.

602
00:33:57,799 --> 00:34:00,245
I thought you were
just a pretty face,

603
00:34:00,269 --> 00:34:02,345
but you're gifted
when it comes to bibimbap.

604
00:34:02,369 --> 00:34:04,116
This is absolutely delicious.

605
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:05,309
Now I'm upset.

606
00:34:05,569 --> 00:34:08,716
You're saying that my looks
aren't as exceptional as my food.

607
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:10,456
No, of course not.

608
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,980
That's not what I meant.

609
00:34:12,279 --> 00:34:14,555
Whatever. Who cares, anyway?

610
00:34:14,579 --> 00:34:16,250
It's not like
I'm going to marry you.

611
00:34:19,489 --> 00:34:20,650
Seo Young,

612
00:34:20,889 --> 00:34:24,066
just so you know,
those guys are only staying here...

613
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:26,659
while my office is under renovation.

614
00:34:26,789 --> 00:34:29,336
They could stay at a hotel...

615
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,175
and this isn't due to
a lack of money.

616
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:33,876
I'm teaching them a lesson
on how to never forget...

617
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:35,345
about the time
when we weren't well off.

618
00:34:35,369 --> 00:34:37,615
I know.
This is part of their training too.

619
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:40,070
That's right.
They are here to train.

620
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:44,055
So don't tell
your grandparents for now.

621
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:45,949
Sure, I'll keep it a secret.

622
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:47,896
They'll leave once
the renovation is over.

623
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,026
Of course.

624
00:34:49,050 --> 00:34:50,820
Ji Hun, you too.

625
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:54,619
- Got it?
- Got it. Don't worry.

626
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,965
Dad, I know what's going on.

627
00:34:59,989 --> 00:35:02,260
Even though you're a CEO,
you're still just as poor.

628
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:05,675
I'm only pretending to be excited
so that it can...

629
00:35:05,699 --> 00:35:07,369
give you energy.

630
00:35:10,099 --> 00:35:13,170
Joon Seon, I'm sorry,
but is there more to eat?

631
00:35:13,269 --> 00:35:15,586
I'd like just a few spoons more too.

632
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:18,980
Of course.
How can vegetables be enough?

633
00:35:19,679 --> 00:35:22,550
They need to eat well
to gather their strength.

634
00:35:22,679 --> 00:35:25,090
- I'll give them a call.
- What?

635
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:28,420
You're saying they need protein.

636
00:35:28,519 --> 00:35:30,019
I'll give them a call.

637
00:35:30,519 --> 00:35:33,736
Sure, of course.
I'll bring home what's left.

638
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,929
Okay, bye.

639
00:35:35,659 --> 00:35:37,845
- Who was that?
- Seo Young.

640
00:35:37,869 --> 00:35:40,876
She asked me to bring home
the leftovers to eat.

641
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:44,046
I bet it was Joon Seon
and Ga Hee who made her do it.

642
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:45,909
They never change, do they?

643
00:35:47,210 --> 00:35:48,856
Let me do that, sir.
You should head home.

644
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,380
No, it's okay.
You closed up yesterday too.

645
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,956
You're here to make deliveries,
not clean up.

646
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:55,095
You should hurry home.

647
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:56,856
Of course.
Go home and get some rest.

648
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,119
Take this.

649
00:35:58,190 --> 00:36:00,595
Have some for a late-night snack.

650
00:36:00,619 --> 00:36:01,860
Here you go.

651
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:03,420
Thank you.

652
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,130
- I'll get going then.
- Sure thing.

653
00:36:08,159 --> 00:36:10,130
Ms. Ok Ja, I'll see you tomorrow.

654
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:15,570
Ok Ja, he's leaving.

655
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:19,610
Oh. Of course, Sweetie.
See you tomorrow.

656
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:30,579
Darn, that's hot!

657
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:35,166
You put it straight
in the microwave?

658
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:37,936
You're supposed to wrap
a towel around it first.

659
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,030
How stupid are you?

660
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:40,706
Why do you care?

661
00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:42,130
So where were you just now?

662
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:43,559
That's none of your business too.

663
00:36:44,769 --> 00:36:46,675
After you huffed and puffed
about giving me a ride,

664
00:36:46,699 --> 00:36:48,400
you went off all by yourself,
you jerk.

665
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,699
"You jerk"?

666
00:36:52,909 --> 00:36:56,239
Sure, call me a jerk. As if I care.

667
00:36:57,239 --> 00:36:59,586
Then why promise me a ride home?

668
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:01,380
Was it just to annoy me?

669
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:05,519
Okay, fine. Can we just leave it?
I'm exhausted as it is.

670
00:37:05,949 --> 00:37:08,059
Fine, let's forget about it.

671
00:37:08,219 --> 00:37:11,989
There are enough guys out there
to give me a ride home anyway.

672
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:14,829
Like who? Who gave you a ride home?

673
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:19,530
Some guy who thinks I'm funny.

674
00:37:22,369 --> 00:37:24,816
She's just full of herself,
isn't she?

675
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:27,210
What a narcissist.

676
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:28,980
It's not good at all.

677
00:37:32,849 --> 00:37:34,280
My gosh.

678
00:37:38,889 --> 00:37:39,920
(Da Hee)

679
00:37:40,619 --> 00:37:43,289
Hi, Da Hee.
Are you calling about the TV show?

680
00:37:43,519 --> 00:37:45,630
Yes, I did, but...

681
00:37:46,429 --> 00:37:50,300
The TV show isn't
what's important though...

682
00:37:51,059 --> 00:37:52,599
So? Hello?

683
00:37:53,199 --> 00:37:54,800
Da Hee?

684
00:37:56,539 --> 00:37:58,369
What on earth was that?

685
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:04,179
Ms. Song,

686
00:38:04,679 --> 00:38:06,809
I never thought
you'd stab me in the back.

687
00:38:14,169 --> 00:38:15,480
(Episode 20)

688
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:20,009
Ms. Song, I never thought
you'd stab me in the back.

689
00:38:20,609 --> 00:38:21,919
Well, it's...

690
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:26,265
What else can I do?

691
00:38:26,289 --> 00:38:29,796
I can't even study properly
because I'm too worried.

692
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:31,396
Still, this is wrong.

693
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:33,829
Have you forgotten
the deal we signed?

694
00:38:34,929 --> 00:38:38,129
No wonder I had this weird feeling
when out with my friends.

695
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,030
I definitely have
the gift of foresight.

696
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,469
What can I do?

697
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:44,939
I'm completely confused.

698
00:38:45,310 --> 00:38:48,070
I am too
and it's all because of you.

699
00:38:56,649 --> 00:38:58,750
Don't pretend to be deeply worried.

700
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:02,165
Whatever you're feeling,
I feel it 10 times more.

701
00:39:02,189 --> 00:39:04,619
My head is about
to explode as well, you know.

702
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:07,490
I'm not happy about
my brother's divorce either.

703
00:39:08,229 --> 00:39:12,030
I'm only doing my best
to keep this a secret...

704
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:16,299
because he's grittier
compared to the last time I saw him.

705
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,215
I'm afraid it could
lead to bloodshed...

706
00:39:19,239 --> 00:39:21,370
All right, fine.
I won't say anything.

707
00:39:23,109 --> 00:39:25,209
I really won't.

708
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:34,790
I don't know how I can
look at my mother now though.

709
00:39:35,390 --> 00:39:38,329
She's super excited
about Na Hee being on TV.

710
00:39:39,530 --> 00:39:41,366
When she finds out...

711
00:39:41,390 --> 00:39:43,406
Well, it'll be like
a bomb has exploded.

712
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:44,906
There's no going back.

713
00:39:44,930 --> 00:39:47,700
I know. It'll sure be scary.

714
00:39:47,799 --> 00:39:49,439
And we'll have to suffer
the consequences.

715
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:53,340
Is there no chance
of them getting back together?

716
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:56,555
Could they take back the divorce?

717
00:39:56,579 --> 00:39:59,250
They wouldn't have gotten one
if it were that easy.

718
00:39:59,379 --> 00:40:02,049
Besides, it's hard to tell
what goes on in a relationship.

719
00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:05,290
They growl at each other
at the hospital too, you know.

720
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:09,659
Na Hee truly loved Gyu Jin though...

721
00:40:10,189 --> 00:40:12,390
and Gyu Jin only had eyes
for Na Hee.

722
00:40:13,629 --> 00:40:15,799
That's how I remember them too.

723
00:40:16,459 --> 00:40:18,370
But that's how relationships are.

724
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:20,169
Futile.

725
00:40:21,330 --> 00:40:23,816
I'm never getting married
ever again.

726
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,846
Na Hee taught me the final lesson.

727
00:40:25,870 --> 00:40:27,210
I agree.

728
00:40:27,270 --> 00:40:30,639
What good does marriage do
when people fall out of love?

729
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:33,680
Let's just drink our beer.

730
00:40:33,879 --> 00:40:35,280
Sure thing.

731
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:56,469
(Ttobongee Chicken)

732
00:41:17,659 --> 00:41:20,389
(Father)

733
00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:45,520
(Ttobongee Chicken)

734
00:41:46,789 --> 00:41:50,090
Children have
narrow nasal cavities...

735
00:41:50,789 --> 00:41:52,605
which can lead to them...

736
00:41:52,629 --> 00:41:55,135
taking loud breaths
after catching a cold.

737
00:41:55,159 --> 00:41:57,506
We haven't had this many patients
ever since opening day, right?

738
00:41:57,530 --> 00:41:59,000
The doctors are
yet to take patients,

739
00:41:59,030 --> 00:42:00,900
but the waiting list
has over 50 names.

740
00:42:01,069 --> 00:42:02,615
Many have asked about
when we're open at night too.

741
00:42:02,639 --> 00:42:06,539
My goodness.
Now that's what I call publicity.

742
00:42:08,139 --> 00:42:10,310
Could this lead to us
expanding our building?

743
00:42:11,139 --> 00:42:12,449
Gosh, that'd be awesome!

744
00:42:15,050 --> 00:42:17,726
You know,
you should get your hair done again.

745
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:19,865
The curls are no longer intact.

746
00:42:19,889 --> 00:42:22,020
I know I should,

747
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:24,189
but my hairdresser
just can't get it right.

748
00:42:24,259 --> 00:42:25,960
Maybe I should switch salons.

749
00:42:26,689 --> 00:42:30,435
The ladies at Unnie's Kimbap always
have nice curls in their hair.

750
00:42:30,459 --> 00:42:31,629
Right?

751
00:42:31,699 --> 00:42:35,170
I saw them from afar and it was
as if they were wearing royal hats.

752
00:42:35,370 --> 00:42:38,540
Here come the King
and the state councilors.

753
00:42:40,370 --> 00:42:42,279
"Your Majesty!"

754
00:42:44,939 --> 00:42:46,779
Good morning.

755
00:42:46,850 --> 00:42:49,625
- You're having your morning coffee.
- Hold on.

756
00:42:49,649 --> 00:42:51,396
Are you brushing the streets today?

757
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:54,065
That was something
your husband always did.

758
00:42:54,089 --> 00:42:56,189
No, I do it sometimes too.

759
00:42:56,389 --> 00:42:59,089
The place needs to be clean
before we open up.

760
00:42:59,259 --> 00:43:01,735
I don't want customers
speaking ill of us...

761
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:04,100
especially now
that our daughter is on TV.

762
00:43:05,370 --> 00:43:06,870
Yes, of course.

763
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,216
I thoroughly enjoyed
the show she was on.

764
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:11,346
Your daughter sure knows
how to make an impression.

765
00:43:11,370 --> 00:43:12,670
I enjoyed it too.

766
00:43:13,439 --> 00:43:16,110
She looked stunning
and so did your son-in-law.

767
00:43:16,139 --> 00:43:18,439
Oh, my. So you two watched it too.

768
00:43:18,879 --> 00:43:22,396
They aired so many reruns
of the show...

769
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:24,156
that almost everyone watched it.

770
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:27,490
You have no idea
how many people have called me.

771
00:43:28,519 --> 00:43:32,029
It's exhausting to have a child
that stands out so much.

772
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:35,129
Parents of celebrities
must have it rough.

773
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:39,329
I guess it'll be a nuisance
for a while.

774
00:43:39,470 --> 00:43:41,569
She's a regular
on that show, you see.

775
00:43:41,699 --> 00:43:44,300
- I see.
- A regular?

776
00:43:44,670 --> 00:43:46,540
Anyway, that's great news.

777
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:48,110
Hold on.

778
00:43:48,269 --> 00:43:51,439
This isn't the time to drink
some cheap instant coffee.

779
00:43:51,709 --> 00:43:54,826
We should have Ok Boon buy us
one of those expensive ones.

780
00:43:54,850 --> 00:43:56,555
You're right!

781
00:43:56,579 --> 00:43:59,949
You should buy us some coffee.
Americano would be nice.

782
00:44:00,089 --> 00:44:01,889
Ok Boon, me too.

783
00:44:01,990 --> 00:44:06,259
Is that so? Should I buy you all
a cup of morning coffee then?

784
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:07,490
Right.

785
00:44:07,860 --> 00:44:10,706
No, he's busy taking care
of his patients.

786
00:44:10,730 --> 00:44:14,000
Well, you know how he has
always been gifted that way.

787
00:44:14,769 --> 00:44:17,339
Not everyone can be on TV, right?

788
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:21,740
My daughter-in-law?

789
00:44:23,939 --> 00:44:26,379
Well, she is a smart one.

790
00:44:29,449 --> 00:44:31,755
He's just letting her win.

791
00:44:31,779 --> 00:44:33,689
Of course he's just as smart.

792
00:44:37,790 --> 00:44:40,206
I have a customer,
so I should get going.

793
00:44:40,230 --> 00:44:41,860
Sure thing.

794
00:44:43,329 --> 00:44:46,129
What does she mean
Na Hee looks smart?

795
00:44:46,230 --> 00:44:47,569
Looks can be deceiving, you know.

796
00:44:48,230 --> 00:44:49,470
Annoying cow.

797
00:44:51,639 --> 00:44:52,939
Yun Jeong!

798
00:44:53,670 --> 00:44:54,670
Yun Jeong.

799
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:56,615
Yes, hi.

800
00:44:56,639 --> 00:44:57,815
What brings you by at this hour?

801
00:44:57,839 --> 00:45:00,550
The ladies at the market
wanted me to treat them to coffee...

802
00:45:00,579 --> 00:45:02,120
since the kids were on TV.

803
00:45:02,319 --> 00:45:03,920
I'll take four Americanos.

804
00:45:05,519 --> 00:45:06,550
Sure.

805
00:45:09,990 --> 00:45:14,129
Why does Na Hee keep
cutting Gyu Jin off though?

806
00:45:14,230 --> 00:45:15,329
Did she?

807
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,875
I only saw it
as affectionate banter.

808
00:45:18,899 --> 00:45:20,629
Another one of those banters...

809
00:45:20,670 --> 00:45:22,240
might lead to her
swallowing him whole.

810
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:25,970
Gyu Jin surprised me, you know.

811
00:45:26,170 --> 00:45:28,346
The camera just
absolutely adored him.

812
00:45:28,370 --> 00:45:31,579
On TV, he looked like that actor.

813
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:34,855
Yes, Hyun Bin! They look so alike.

814
00:45:34,879 --> 00:45:39,250
The people at the market say
that he's incredibly handsome too.

815
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:41,050
His good looks?

816
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:43,720
He takes that after me, I guess.

817
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:45,930
Yes, of course!

818
00:45:45,990 --> 00:45:48,529
He's so sweet
with his words as well.

819
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:52,769
You have no idea how proud I was
to be his mother-in-law.

820
00:45:52,930 --> 00:45:55,415
Na Hee looked incredible on TV too.

821
00:45:55,439 --> 00:45:57,069
She seemed so smart as well.

822
00:45:57,370 --> 00:46:01,509
She only looks that way because
Gyu Jin let her take center stage.

823
00:46:01,910 --> 00:46:03,839
What does Na Hee have anyway?

824
00:46:04,509 --> 00:46:06,726
She was a bit too talkative too.

825
00:46:06,750 --> 00:46:10,180
Don't say that. Na Hee seemed
like the smartest one up there.

826
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:12,196
Ok Boon,

827
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:14,495
I'm heading out
to the department store later.

828
00:46:14,519 --> 00:46:17,036
Should we ask
the kids out for a meal?

829
00:46:17,060 --> 00:46:18,089
The hospital's nearby.

830
00:46:18,459 --> 00:46:21,005
Could we do that?
They're probably busy.

831
00:46:21,029 --> 00:46:22,836
They still need to eat though.

832
00:46:22,860 --> 00:46:24,829
Don't they get a lunch break?

833
00:46:25,829 --> 00:46:27,069
Shall we then?

834
00:46:27,399 --> 00:46:28,915
I mean, could we?

835
00:46:28,939 --> 00:46:31,045
Of course we can.
Don't you know who we are?

836
00:46:31,069 --> 00:46:32,946
We're the mothers who gave birth...

837
00:46:32,970 --> 00:46:34,485
to the two celebrity doctors.

838
00:46:34,509 --> 00:46:38,079
That alone makes us worthy
of getting a meal out of them.

839
00:46:39,180 --> 00:46:40,157
Right.

840
00:46:40,181 --> 00:46:43,779
Why would you go there
when the kids are at work?

841
00:46:45,179 --> 00:46:47,125
Okay, fine.
Just stick to the meal...

842
00:46:47,149 --> 00:46:49,519
and don't do anything
to bother them too much.

843
00:46:51,519 --> 00:46:52,629
Unbelievable.

844
00:46:52,730 --> 00:46:55,706
One minute,
they're at each other's throat,

845
00:46:55,730 --> 00:46:58,000
and the next minute,
they're best buddies.

846
00:46:58,460 --> 00:47:00,600
Ok Ja, is that how women are?

847
00:47:01,669 --> 00:47:05,015
Those two have always
been like that.

848
00:47:05,039 --> 00:47:07,409
They team up
but then go back to arguing.

849
00:47:08,110 --> 00:47:10,710
You seem discouraged today.
Is something troubling you?

850
00:47:11,009 --> 00:47:12,409
Troubling me?

851
00:47:14,909 --> 00:47:16,019
Young Dal,

852
00:47:16,779 --> 00:47:19,590
have you always wanted
to marry someone like Ok Boon?

853
00:47:20,519 --> 00:47:22,720
What? Where on earth
is this coming from?

854
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:27,929
They say your dreams and reality
are two different things but...

855
00:47:28,759 --> 00:47:30,360
- I'm back.
- Right.

856
00:47:31,159 --> 00:47:32,830
He's more of my type.

857
00:47:33,529 --> 00:47:34,529
Sorry?

858
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:39,846
The fact that looking at you
puts a smile on my face...

859
00:47:39,870 --> 00:47:41,970
proves that my eyes
are fully functional,

860
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:46,409
but why is my heart acting out?

861
00:47:46,809 --> 00:47:50,120
What's going on?
You're not making any sense.

862
00:47:51,419 --> 00:47:53,320
This is all your fault!

863
00:47:53,690 --> 00:47:58,019
This is because you said
he might actually grow on me.

864
00:47:58,490 --> 00:48:01,289
I'm going to hold you
responsible for this!

865
00:48:05,870 --> 00:48:06,875
Yes?

866
00:48:06,899 --> 00:48:08,576
Your morning shift is over.

867
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:10,169
What a relief.

868
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:12,586
How many patients
do I have in the afternoon?

869
00:48:12,610 --> 00:48:15,046
You're fully booked today...

870
00:48:15,070 --> 00:48:16,285
and we have a few walk-ins,
so the shift will be long.

871
00:48:16,309 --> 00:48:18,080
Okay.

872
00:48:23,580 --> 00:48:25,120
(Mother)

873
00:48:26,519 --> 00:48:28,149
Yes, Mom. What is it this time?

874
00:48:29,759 --> 00:48:32,259
What? The hospital lobby?

875
00:48:32,429 --> 00:48:33,559
Yes, Mom.

876
00:48:34,889 --> 00:48:35,899
The hospital?

877
00:48:37,830 --> 00:48:39,769
Who? With Mother?

878
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:45,909
Here. Please enjoy.

879
00:48:49,340 --> 00:48:53,056
I asked Ok Boon to come.
I wanted to eat with you guys.

880
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:54,086
I see.

881
00:48:54,110 --> 00:48:57,279
I know it's so sudden.
I hope you don't mind, Gyu Jin.

882
00:48:57,379 --> 00:48:58,926
Of course I don't.

883
00:48:58,950 --> 00:49:01,889
We're just happy to see you.

884
00:49:06,789 --> 00:49:09,275
I heard you're getting
a lot of patients after the show.

885
00:49:09,299 --> 00:49:10,605
Jae Seok told me.

886
00:49:10,629 --> 00:49:13,005
It's not that many.

887
00:49:13,029 --> 00:49:14,629
It's just temporary.

888
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:17,775
You are such a good speaker.

889
00:49:17,799 --> 00:49:20,710
You sound so kind and gentle.
It's quite captivating.

890
00:49:22,379 --> 00:49:26,025
But Na Hee just retorts sharply.

891
00:49:26,049 --> 00:49:28,186
She should sometimes
beat around the bush.

892
00:49:28,210 --> 00:49:30,919
Why? That's what makes
Na Hee attractive.

893
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:34,096
I don't like people who say
things they don't even mean.

894
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:37,336
I prefer honest and straightforward
people like Na Hee.

895
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:40,535
Thank you
for your kind words, Ms. Choi.

896
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:42,899
My pleasure, Ms. Jang.

897
00:49:44,129 --> 00:49:45,700
- Let's eat.
- Eat.

898
00:49:46,269 --> 00:49:47,706
- Are they from "Doctors"?
- Yes.

899
00:49:47,730 --> 00:49:49,375
- They are the pediatricians.
- The pediatricians.

900
00:49:49,399 --> 00:49:51,275
That's right. "Doctors".

901
00:49:51,299 --> 00:49:52,940
My goodness.

902
00:49:53,169 --> 00:49:54,940
He's my son,
and she's my daughter-in-law.

903
00:49:55,509 --> 00:49:59,110
He's my son-in-law,
and she's my daughter.

904
00:49:59,610 --> 00:50:02,110
- You must be happy.
- I'm a fan.

905
00:50:02,549 --> 00:50:04,096
- He's so handsome.
- Gosh.

906
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:05,155
Hello.

907
00:50:05,179 --> 00:50:07,019
- They look amazing.
- Gosh.

908
00:50:07,620 --> 00:50:08,720
They say you're handsome.

909
00:50:12,389 --> 00:50:14,765
- Let's eat.
- This show is really something.

910
00:50:14,789 --> 00:50:15,860
Just eat.

911
00:50:18,029 --> 00:50:19,306
Are you that happy?

912
00:50:19,330 --> 00:50:22,416
What? Of course I am.

913
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:24,570
I feel like
I'm floating on cloud nine.

914
00:50:24,899 --> 00:50:26,346
It's not that big a deal.

915
00:50:26,370 --> 00:50:27,740
I'm serious.

916
00:50:27,769 --> 00:50:30,480
It feels great
to go to the market these days.

917
00:50:30,879 --> 00:50:33,985
I didn't say much,
but ever since Da Hee's annulment,

918
00:50:34,009 --> 00:50:37,450
I've always felt like the women
are gossiping about my kids.

919
00:50:37,820 --> 00:50:40,450
So I even took the long way around.

920
00:50:41,350 --> 00:50:45,789
But I try to pass by
more crowded areas these days.

921
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:53,230
What? Do you think I'm snobbish?

922
00:50:53,399 --> 00:50:56,570
I just can't help it.
I'm so happy these days.

923
00:50:57,500 --> 00:51:00,309
Really? I'm happy for you then.

924
00:51:01,970 --> 00:51:03,009
What?

925
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:05,110
Nothing. Let's go.

926
00:51:08,210 --> 00:51:11,879
Hey, why are you walking like that?
Did you get hurt?

927
00:51:12,179 --> 00:51:14,865
No. It's not serious. I'm fine.

928
00:51:14,889 --> 00:51:18,436
You don't seem fine.
You have weak bones.

929
00:51:18,460 --> 00:51:21,190
You would often sprain your ankle
when you were young.

930
00:51:21,730 --> 00:51:24,905
I'll buy some beef leg bones
from Mr. Yang and make bone soup.

931
00:51:24,929 --> 00:51:26,289
You should stop by and pick it up.

932
00:51:26,830 --> 00:51:29,076
It's okay. Don't bother.

933
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:32,000
It's not okay at all.
Just listen to me.

934
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:34,240
Make sure to stop by
and take it later. Okay?

935
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:39,450
Yes. He's out at the moment.

936
00:51:40,279 --> 00:51:41,279
Who is this?

937
00:51:45,220 --> 00:51:46,750
Did you put your house on sale?

938
00:51:47,350 --> 00:51:49,395
- What?
- It's from a realtor.

939
00:51:49,419 --> 00:51:51,166
He wants to see your house.

940
00:51:51,190 --> 00:51:53,129
Gosh. Hang on.

941
00:51:54,129 --> 00:51:56,399
Why did you answer my phone?

942
00:51:56,559 --> 00:51:59,000
I was just... Why...

943
00:51:59,029 --> 00:52:02,145
Did you really put
your house up for sale?

944
00:52:02,169 --> 00:52:04,299
No. What are you talking about?

945
00:52:05,639 --> 00:52:06,840
Hang on.

946
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:08,570
Yes, hello?

947
00:52:09,639 --> 00:52:12,779
Yes. I think you have
the wrong number.

948
00:52:13,250 --> 00:52:15,796
My number is 3778. Yes.

949
00:52:15,820 --> 00:52:17,850
Okay. You should feel sorry.

950
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:24,190
He called the wrong number.
He asked if my number was 3779.

951
00:52:25,389 --> 00:52:28,105
I wondered what was going on.

952
00:52:28,129 --> 00:52:30,600
I know. That can't be right.

953
00:52:32,059 --> 00:52:33,129
Hurry.

954
00:52:34,399 --> 00:52:38,740
If you're done eating,
shall we go now?

955
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:40,485
- Gosh.
- Get home safely.

956
00:52:40,509 --> 00:52:42,456
- Bye.
- Okay. Bye.

957
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:43,580
I enjoyed the meal.

958
00:52:43,610 --> 00:52:45,450
Na Hee, make sure to
come and pick up the soup.

959
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:47,226
- Okay.
- Bye.

960
00:52:47,250 --> 00:52:48,385
- Bye.
- Bye.

961
00:52:48,409 --> 00:52:51,250
Please drive safely. Bye.

962
00:52:55,990 --> 00:52:58,259
- Hurry.
- Gosh, don't rush me.

963
00:53:00,759 --> 00:53:04,836
Hello, sir. I'm so sorry.
I had some circumstances.

964
00:53:04,860 --> 00:53:05,929
Yes.

965
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:08,706
Sure. We can be there now.

966
00:53:08,730 --> 00:53:10,946
In 30 minutes? Tell him 20 minutes.

967
00:53:10,970 --> 00:53:14,009
We can get there in 20 minutes.

968
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:23,980
Sir.

969
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:28,765
- Hello.
- You're here early.

970
00:53:28,789 --> 00:53:30,696
Yes. We're on our way. Hello.

971
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:33,865
I'm sorry.
I couldn't reach you earlier,

972
00:53:33,889 --> 00:53:35,659
so I showed them something else.

973
00:53:35,899 --> 00:53:37,176
And they liked it,

974
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:39,269
so we're about to sign
a provisional contract.

975
00:53:39,470 --> 00:53:41,206
I'm sorry you came for nothing.

976
00:53:41,230 --> 00:53:42,269
What?

977
00:53:44,470 --> 00:53:45,600
Goodness.

978
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:53,385
You always carry
the phone with you.

979
00:53:53,409 --> 00:53:55,385
Why did you not bring it today?

980
00:53:55,409 --> 00:53:59,596
If you answered the call,
we wouldn't have missed it.

981
00:53:59,620 --> 00:54:01,696
Why are you blaming me?

982
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:04,059
I didn't know
the realtor would call me.

983
00:54:04,460 --> 00:54:05,495
Whatever.

984
00:54:05,519 --> 00:54:07,029
It was the first call in a month.

985
00:54:07,059 --> 00:54:08,865
What do we do now?
When are we going to sell the house?

986
00:54:08,889 --> 00:54:12,176
How would I know? I'm upset too.

987
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:13,929
Stop nagging me.

988
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,976
Are you yelling at me now?

989
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,515
No, you're making me upset.

990
00:54:17,539 --> 00:54:20,809
Do you think you have
the right to say that?

991
00:54:22,210 --> 00:54:23,615
Oh, hello.

992
00:54:23,639 --> 00:54:25,110
- Hi.
- Hello.

993
00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:28,049
Right. We were just out together.

994
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:39,000
(Yongju Traditional Market
Merchant Association)

995
00:54:39,929 --> 00:54:41,889
I just can't do this.

996
00:54:42,529 --> 00:54:45,706
I can bench press 150kg,

997
00:54:45,730 --> 00:54:47,306
but my body is stiff.

998
00:54:47,330 --> 00:54:50,115
This is just too hard for me.

999
00:54:50,139 --> 00:54:53,269
We're just doing it for exercise.
Don't worry about your moves.

1000
00:54:53,370 --> 00:54:56,539
What are you talking about?
I want to do it right.

1001
00:54:57,740 --> 00:54:59,750
My goodness.

1002
00:55:00,450 --> 00:55:02,796
I'm a bad dancer, so I'm jealous...

1003
00:55:02,820 --> 00:55:05,120
of those who are good at this.
They're so cool.

1004
00:55:09,860 --> 00:55:11,019
Ok Ja, you're here.

1005
00:55:14,289 --> 00:55:15,360
Where's Ok Boon?

1006
00:55:16,259 --> 00:55:18,559
She's making beef bone soup,
so she can't come tonight.

1007
00:55:20,029 --> 00:55:22,230
Ok Ja, what's up with your lips?

1008
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,299
Did you eat gochujang or what?

1009
00:55:24,670 --> 00:55:29,009
I didn't eat anything.
My lips are always red.

1010
00:55:29,170 --> 00:55:33,109
Gosh, that's not true.
You put something on your lips.

1011
00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:37,619
You're wearing perfume too.

1012
00:55:38,819 --> 00:55:41,490
This is what I smell usually like.

1013
00:55:42,250 --> 00:55:43,936
Do you think I'm crazy?

1014
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:47,130
Why would I wear lipstick
and perfume when I exercise?

1015
00:55:47,430 --> 00:55:49,759
It's not like there's someone
I want to impress here.

1016
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:51,805
My point exactly.

1017
00:55:51,829 --> 00:55:53,970
I know. That's my point too.

1018
00:55:54,799 --> 00:55:56,039
Don't be ridiculous.

1019
00:56:06,049 --> 00:56:07,910
Is this the dance sports class?

1020
00:56:08,609 --> 00:56:11,356
Yes, it is.

1021
00:56:11,380 --> 00:56:14,420
I'm here to learn how to dance.

1022
00:56:18,589 --> 00:56:21,206
Gosh, the floor is too small.

1023
00:56:21,230 --> 00:56:23,359
How would I make
my moves properly here?

1024
00:56:25,660 --> 00:56:26,829
- Stop.
- Stop.

1025
00:56:27,470 --> 00:56:28,900
Where are you going?

1026
00:56:29,130 --> 00:56:30,650
I want to dance
in front of the mirror.

1027
00:56:32,339 --> 00:56:35,980
You're new here today.
Don't you think...

1028
00:56:36,009 --> 00:56:37,779
you're being too sassy
to stand at the front?

1029
00:56:37,910 --> 00:56:39,285
I know.

1030
00:56:39,309 --> 00:56:41,985
We have our system and progress.

1031
00:56:42,009 --> 00:56:45,220
We stand according to skill level.
It's like a tournament.

1032
00:56:45,319 --> 00:56:47,720
It will take you about three months
to get to the front.

1033
00:56:48,549 --> 00:56:49,589
Is that so?

1034
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:53,490
Don't humiliate yourself
and stand at the back, newbie.

1035
00:57:13,450 --> 00:57:15,750
- What's going on?
- Was she a dancer?

1036
00:57:16,450 --> 00:57:17,519
She's unbelievable.

1037
00:57:28,430 --> 00:57:30,029
She's so cool.

1038
00:57:33,130 --> 00:57:35,569
It feels great to dance it out
after so long.

1039
00:57:39,039 --> 00:57:41,539
Wait. Excuse me.

1040
00:57:42,170 --> 00:57:44,210
Excuse me.
Are you the kimbap restaurant owner?

1041
00:57:44,339 --> 00:57:46,410
Yes. And you're
the butcher shop owner.

1042
00:57:46,710 --> 00:57:47,985
Why are you leaving so early?

1043
00:57:48,009 --> 00:57:51,220
Why don't you stay and talk
with the other merchants?

1044
00:57:51,750 --> 00:57:54,089
No. I'm not used to this group yet.

1045
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:58,835
Well... Can I call you Cho Yeon?

1046
00:57:58,859 --> 00:58:01,190
I saw your name
on the membership card.

1047
00:58:02,230 --> 00:58:04,829
Yes, sure.
Names are meant to be called.

1048
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,906
Gosh, your moves were so...

1049
00:58:08,930 --> 00:58:11,515
You're such a great dancer,
Cho Yeon.

1050
00:58:11,539 --> 00:58:14,616
I used to take dance lessons.

1051
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:15,845
As a hobby and to lose weight.

1052
00:58:15,869 --> 00:58:18,910
You don't need to lose weight.

1053
00:58:19,849 --> 00:58:23,380
This is the secret to my vitality.

1054
00:58:23,450 --> 00:58:25,525
Eat this on your way back.

1055
00:58:25,549 --> 00:58:28,920
I can easily find red ginseng juice
at a convenience store.

1056
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:30,890
Thank you anyway.

1057
00:58:34,859 --> 00:58:38,436
She's so feisty and prickly.

1058
00:58:38,460 --> 00:58:40,069
A perfect wild rose.

1059
00:58:41,470 --> 00:58:43,400
She almost has a sting.

1060
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:53,549
What are you doing here?

1061
00:59:07,559 --> 00:59:12,529
In an alleyway two days ago,
someone jumped a lady for her bag.

1062
00:59:13,630 --> 00:59:16,839
I'm too scared to walk alone.

1063
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:20,339
Someone got jumped? For real?

1064
00:59:25,279 --> 00:59:27,950
Dad? Will you wait for me outside?

1065
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:32,480
No, someone got jumped nearby.

1066
00:59:33,250 --> 00:59:36,759
Don't hang up.
Let's talk while I walk home.

1067
00:59:40,730 --> 00:59:42,490
Hey, I'm at the hospital.

1068
00:59:42,730 --> 00:59:44,730
I'm going straight home.

1069
00:59:46,230 --> 00:59:48,310
You know that three card wallets
got canceled, right?

1070
00:59:48,970 --> 00:59:49,970
Yes.

1071
00:59:50,170 --> 00:59:51,869
Close up and go home.

1072
00:59:52,339 --> 00:59:53,470
Bye.

1073
00:59:56,710 --> 01:00:00,279
(Gyu Jin)

1074
01:00:05,779 --> 01:00:06,849
Bo Young.

1075
01:00:07,420 --> 01:00:08,819
Oh, Gyu Jin.

1076
01:00:10,460 --> 01:00:11,619
Why are you here?

1077
01:00:12,359 --> 01:00:13,960
Papers for the insurance company.

1078
01:00:14,230 --> 01:00:16,130
- Are you leaving now?
- Yes.

1079
01:00:17,900 --> 01:00:20,630
I saw you on TV.
You look good on camera.

1080
01:00:21,269 --> 01:00:23,716
I thought of texting you but didn't.

1081
01:00:23,740 --> 01:00:25,245
Why didn't you?

1082
01:00:25,269 --> 01:00:27,785
In case you ignore it
because you're famous.

1083
01:00:27,809 --> 01:00:30,656
I wouldn't do that
after just one appearance.

1084
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:32,180
Maybe after 2 or 3 more shows?

1085
01:00:33,809 --> 01:00:35,686
Are you going to the workshop?

1086
01:00:35,710 --> 01:00:38,920
I'm headed home today.
The helper has to leave at 7 p.m.

1087
01:00:40,049 --> 01:00:42,019
Didn't you say you live
in Yongho-dong?

1088
01:00:42,819 --> 01:00:44,720
It's on the way. I'll drop you off.

1089
01:00:47,029 --> 01:00:49,730
I'm not sure if I should
keep owing you like this.

1090
01:00:50,700 --> 01:00:54,245
I'm dropping you off on the way.
You don't owe me for that.

1091
01:00:54,269 --> 01:00:55,805
Some people even carpool.

1092
01:00:55,829 --> 01:00:58,569
By the way, is Dr. Song okay?

1093
01:00:58,869 --> 01:01:01,009
It looked like
she hurt her foot that day.

1094
01:01:01,109 --> 01:01:03,640
Yes. She sprained her ankle.

1095
01:01:04,539 --> 01:01:08,250
She's slow and doesn't exercise,
so it happens a lot.

1096
01:01:09,819 --> 01:01:12,480
Really? It must be so uncomfortable.

1097
01:01:14,420 --> 01:01:17,859
What was it you were
going to tell me that day?

1098
01:01:18,119 --> 01:01:19,220
What?

1099
01:01:19,559 --> 01:01:21,535
You said I shouldn't feel ashamed,

1100
01:01:21,559 --> 01:01:23,829
and were about to say
something else.

1101
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:26,299
Oh, was I?

1102
01:01:27,299 --> 01:01:28,630
That was...

1103
01:01:29,099 --> 01:01:31,069
I don't know. I forgot.

1104
01:01:35,269 --> 01:01:37,140
How's your workshop?
Is business good?

1105
01:01:38,140 --> 01:01:39,710
So-so.

1106
01:01:40,279 --> 01:01:43,220
Not many come to make
real masterpieces.

1107
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:45,420
They just come to relieve stress.

1108
01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:48,396
When you really don't want to think,

1109
01:01:48,420 --> 01:01:50,690
it helps to keep your hands busy.

1110
01:01:52,559 --> 01:01:54,835
I think I might have to visit.

1111
01:01:54,859 --> 01:01:56,700
You can, at any time.

1112
01:01:57,460 --> 01:02:00,569
For you,
I'll provide much nicer leather.

1113
01:02:07,809 --> 01:02:08,940
It's Si Hoo.

1114
01:02:09,609 --> 01:02:12,109
- He wants his favorite gummies.
- I see.

1115
01:02:12,309 --> 01:02:14,150
Drop me off in front of that store.

1116
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:18,349
Shall I get out too?
I have to get a few things.

1117
01:02:20,289 --> 01:02:22,519
My girlfriend wanted this so much.

1118
01:02:23,259 --> 01:02:25,690
I couldn't find it
once the season passed.

1119
01:02:27,690 --> 01:02:28,930
Exactly.

1120
01:02:29,700 --> 01:02:31,730
I can never get it back,

1121
01:02:32,730 --> 01:02:34,569
and to think I must sell it...

1122
01:02:38,799 --> 01:02:41,640
It's in such great condition.
No scratches at all.

1123
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:43,609
You bet.

1124
01:02:44,309 --> 01:02:46,279
I treasured it more than
my own skin.

1125
01:02:50,319 --> 01:02:51,779
Here you go. In cash.

1126
01:03:12,039 --> 01:03:14,339
You reached rock bottom, Ga Hee.

1127
01:03:16,039 --> 01:03:17,180
But then again,

1128
01:03:17,779 --> 01:03:20,349
you can't afford designer bags
at the moment.

1129
01:03:28,519 --> 01:03:30,999
I'll only have 60 dollars left
after paying off my credit card.

1130
01:03:32,119 --> 01:03:34,630
I should buy
Ji Hun's favorite snacks.

1131
01:03:38,660 --> 01:03:41,299
So is this what Si Hoo likes?

1132
01:03:42,599 --> 01:03:44,640
It looks good. I should get some.

1133
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:48,315
Here, my gift to you.

1134
01:03:48,339 --> 01:03:49,839
Share it with Dr. Song.

1135
01:03:50,980 --> 01:03:52,140
I'm paying.

1136
01:03:52,910 --> 01:03:53,956
No, I'll...

1137
01:03:53,980 --> 01:03:55,626
It's to celebrate his discharge.

1138
01:03:55,650 --> 01:03:58,920
Gummies are the best when
trying to bribe kids under 10.

1139
01:04:00,690 --> 01:04:02,089
He's good.

1140
01:04:02,220 --> 01:04:04,119
A true pediatrician.

1141
01:04:08,589 --> 01:04:09,799
Gyu Jin?

1142
01:04:10,829 --> 01:04:12,059
Wait.

1143
01:04:13,430 --> 01:04:14,900
What will you get?

1144
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:18,170
Where's the curry?

1145
01:04:22,970 --> 01:04:24,079
Oh, right.

1146
01:04:31,180 --> 01:04:33,250
What is this?

1147
01:04:39,119 --> 01:04:40,859
Ji Hun, Mom's home.

1148
01:04:42,430 --> 01:04:43,829
Na Hee.

1149
01:04:44,660 --> 01:04:46,359
You're home. Where were you?

1150
01:04:46,630 --> 01:04:48,670
Oh, I was out.

1151
01:04:49,430 --> 01:04:50,676
Kids, I bought snacks.

1152
01:04:50,700 --> 01:04:52,269
Yay, snacks.

1153
01:04:52,369 --> 01:04:53,809
Thank you, Mom.

1154
01:04:55,009 --> 01:04:56,339
Why are you at home?

1155
01:04:56,680 --> 01:04:59,809
Mom called me 12 times to tell me
to take some beef bone soup.

1156
01:04:59,910 --> 01:05:01,250
But she's not at home.

1157
01:05:02,180 --> 01:05:03,220
I see.

1158
01:05:04,079 --> 01:05:06,819
Hey, your show was awesome.
Didn't you get great reviews?

1159
01:05:07,690 --> 01:05:09,119
So-so.

1160
01:05:10,859 --> 01:05:13,789
Why didn't Gyu Jin come with you?

1161
01:05:14,559 --> 01:05:15,660
What?

1162
01:05:16,829 --> 01:05:18,160
Oh, he's at work.

1163
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:21,730
He's working late,
preparing for a seminar.

1164
01:05:22,299 --> 01:05:23,569
He said that?

1165
01:05:23,799 --> 01:05:25,339
That he'll work late?

1166
01:05:26,069 --> 01:05:27,809
Yes. Why?

1167
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:31,039
No... It's nothing.

1168
01:05:32,140 --> 01:05:34,025
Seo Young, Seo Jin, Dad's home!

1169
01:05:34,049 --> 01:05:35,680
I'm home.

1170
01:05:38,019 --> 01:05:40,420
- Let go. Let go of me.
- Ga Hee.

1171
01:05:42,319 --> 01:05:44,166
Why drag me out
as soon as I got home?

1172
01:05:44,190 --> 01:05:45,920
I want some soup.

1173
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:48,866
Yes, Ga Hee. I'm tired.
Can't we talk tomorrow?

1174
01:05:48,890 --> 01:05:52,000
Hey. This is no time to
talk like that.

1175
01:05:52,130 --> 01:05:53,745
This is an emergency
sibling meeting.

1176
01:05:53,769 --> 01:05:54,805
About what?

1177
01:05:54,829 --> 01:05:56,900
You should call Na Hee too.
Why leave her out?

1178
01:05:56,940 --> 01:05:58,299
Song Na Hee!

1179
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:01,045
What is wrong with you?

1180
01:06:01,069 --> 01:06:02,410
What's this about?

1181
01:06:03,609 --> 01:06:04,910
My gosh.

1182
01:06:05,710 --> 01:06:07,509
Don't get shocked and just listen.

1183
01:06:09,450 --> 01:06:11,079
Song Na Hee that idiot.

1184
01:06:11,319 --> 01:06:12,995
She's not smart at all.

1185
01:06:13,019 --> 01:06:14,226
My heart breaks for her.

1186
01:06:14,250 --> 01:06:15,565
What is this about?

1187
01:06:15,589 --> 01:06:18,059
I'm dying over here.
Just spit it out.

1188
01:06:18,390 --> 01:06:19,559
Gyu Jin.

1189
01:06:21,430 --> 01:06:23,400
Song Na Hee's husband, Yoon Gyu Jin.

1190
01:06:25,029 --> 01:06:26,630
The jerk is having an affair.

1191
01:06:26,970 --> 01:06:28,245
- What?
- What?

1192
01:06:28,269 --> 01:06:29,700
I saw them myself.

1193
01:06:29,769 --> 01:06:32,269
He was buying groceries
with some woman.

1194
01:06:32,500 --> 01:06:34,045
But Na Hee...

1195
01:06:34,069 --> 01:06:36,656
believes that he's working late.

1196
01:06:36,680 --> 01:06:37,779
That idiot.

1197
01:06:38,039 --> 01:06:41,079
That's why book-smart kids
get into trouble.

1198
01:06:41,150 --> 01:06:43,426
Their other senses are way too dull.

1199
01:06:43,450 --> 01:06:45,750
Is that true? Did you see for sure?

1200
01:06:46,180 --> 01:06:49,226
Ga Hee, don't you think
you got the wrong idea?

1201
01:06:49,250 --> 01:06:51,136
Or maybe there's an explanation.

1202
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:54,765
Isn't this a jump because he was
at a grocery store with a woman?

1203
01:06:54,789 --> 01:06:56,960
Hey. Don't you know how sharp I am?

1204
01:06:57,630 --> 01:07:00,599
I may not have a hunched back,
but my hunch is always correct.

1205
01:07:01,730 --> 01:07:05,140
To be honest, it's been a while
since I sensed something was off.

1206
01:07:05,740 --> 01:07:09,210
When he came over for chicken,
Gyu Jin wasn't his usual self.

1207
01:07:09,269 --> 01:07:10,779
That's when it began.

1208
01:07:11,910 --> 01:07:13,309
Yoon Gyu Jin.

1209
01:07:13,450 --> 01:07:16,619
With that sweet face,
he talked up to Mom,

1210
01:07:16,680 --> 01:07:18,226
and he stabbed us in the back.

1211
01:07:18,250 --> 01:07:19,450
Exactly.

1212
01:07:20,119 --> 01:07:23,460
Cheaters don't go around
with a sign saying they're cheating,

1213
01:07:23,789 --> 01:07:26,606
but I never suspected Gyu Jin
of all people would cheat.

1214
01:07:26,630 --> 01:07:29,835
No. Whether he really did
stab us in the back...

1215
01:07:29,859 --> 01:07:31,005
isn't sure yet.

1216
01:07:31,029 --> 01:07:32,200
It is sure.

1217
01:07:32,859 --> 01:07:35,230
The woman was shooting hearts
from her eyes.

1218
01:07:35,299 --> 01:07:37,170
I know that look!

1219
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:40,970
I wanted to grab them both
on the spot.

1220
01:07:41,809 --> 01:07:43,509
I will make him pay.

1221
01:07:43,640 --> 01:07:45,386
Joon Seon. Where will you go?

1222
01:07:45,410 --> 01:07:46,755
To get Yoon Gyu Jin.

1223
01:07:46,779 --> 01:07:49,456
The scumbag
betrayed our sister to cheat!

1224
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:51,196
Yes! Let's go.

1225
01:07:51,220 --> 01:07:53,226
Let's go and beat him half-dead.

1226
01:07:53,250 --> 01:07:54,265
Let's go.

1227
01:07:54,289 --> 01:07:57,295
Ga Hee, Joon Seon.
It's too late to do this.

1228
01:07:57,319 --> 01:07:58,890
Last One, you stay here.

1229
01:07:59,220 --> 01:08:02,390
Yes. Don't tip off Na Hee
or Mom and Dad.

1230
01:08:04,660 --> 01:08:06,160
Na Hee got divorced!

1231
01:08:12,470 --> 01:08:13,470
What?

1232
01:08:14,009 --> 01:08:17,180
Na Hee and Gyu Jin got divorced.

1233
01:08:17,410 --> 01:08:18,609
Not too long ago.

1234
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:51,079
(Once Again)

1235
01:08:51,140 --> 01:08:53,085
You're giving me this for free?

1236
01:08:53,109 --> 01:08:54,680
I had some leftover parts.

1237
01:08:54,980 --> 01:08:57,220
Why does he keep
bringing over free meat?

1238
01:08:57,319 --> 01:09:00,920
Why else?
He has fallen for one of us.

1239
01:09:00,990 --> 01:09:03,295
- This just isn't right.
- What can we do though?

1240
01:09:03,319 --> 01:09:05,319
We have to talk to Na Hee.

1241
01:09:06,259 --> 01:09:09,265
You know how Na Hee is.
She could just explode, right?

1242
01:09:09,289 --> 01:09:11,029
And it's Dad's birthday tomorrow.

1243
01:09:11,130 --> 01:09:12,805
You're right. It's Dad's birthday.

1244
01:09:12,829 --> 01:09:16,106
Families and friends,
and everyone in attendance today,

1245
01:09:16,130 --> 01:09:18,416
thank you all for coming.

1246
01:09:18,440 --> 01:09:21,440
Did you know that our President Song
is gifted on the guitar?
