1
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:49,950
What are you talking about?

2
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:53,120
You can't go.
Your due date is the day after tomorrow.

3
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,120
Goodness. It's okay, Mom.

4
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,830
It won't kill me.

5
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:59,250
I know it's work, but you're almost--

6
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:03,290
Okay. I'll finish it quickly,
and go straight home.

7
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:04,710
My goodness.

8
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:08,090
There's no stopping her.

9
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:11,640
Gosh, it's already a quarter to two.

10
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:13,720
Is Yu-ri going somewhere?

11
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:17,770
Someone who bought her work
asked her to fix something.

12
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:20,810
She's due soon,
she shouldn't be going around.

13
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:22,100
Why didn't you stop her?

14
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:23,730
You know she doesn't listen to me.

15
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:28,240
She said she'd be quick,
so she'll be fine.

16
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:32,360
So, what did you say you dreamed about?

17
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:34,370
I don't know. I don't remember.

18
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:36,990
I woke up this morning feeling weird.

19
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,790
I feel uneasy.

20
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:41,290
It probably means nothing
since you don't remember.

21
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:48,170
Goodness, it's all done.

22
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:58,140
Hello?

23
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,810
Yes, it is.

24
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:13,950
I wish there was an emergency blinker

25
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,740
for the bad luck that suddenly drops in.

26
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,870
I can't avoid the pain
that's about to rush in,

27
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:22,830
but I can prepare for it at least.

28
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,130
They said

29
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:29,920
his name would give him a short life.

30
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:35,050
I thought nothing of it.

31
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:38,100
Why did I do that?

32
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:43,390
If only I changed his name...

33
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,730
I feel like

34
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:49,780
it's my fault.

35
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,700
Everyday I want to turn back time

36
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,830
to that day tens of thousands of times.

37
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:04,580
If only I stopped her

38
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:08,170
from going to work

39
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:11,420
just for five minutes.

40
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,920
No,

41
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:17,760
just for one more minute,

42
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,810
then she'd still be here.

43
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:26,400
Why didn't I stop her?

44
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:40,160
But even if there is a blinker,

45
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:45,210
bad luck will never turn it on
so we can notice it.

46
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,790
She died because of me.

47
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,460
I killed her.

48
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:55,930
I did.

49
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:00,010
I killed her.

50
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:05,850
Bring Yu-ri back.

51
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:08,480
Bring her back.

52
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:12,440
Bring her back, you jerk.

53
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,860
Bring Yu-ri back.

54
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:17,910
So you don't have to blame yourself

55
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,240
for not seeing it.

56
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:25,660
EPISODE 14: IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT

57
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,170
Min-jeong.

58
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,050
Why are you crying? Don't cry.

59
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:35,800
It's not your fault. Okay?

60
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:40,220
Then whose fault is it?

61
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:45,140
Is it because you're at the hospital
all day long?

62
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:52,020
I hired a pick-up helper
to return to work, then lost my child.

63
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:55,780
And Seo-woo

64
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:01,870
is slower and grayer than most children.

65
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:06,000
If all of those aren't my fault,
whose fault is it?

66
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,250
Am I not her mother?

67
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:10,790
Min-jeong.

68
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:16,260
When something is wrong with a kid,
everyone blames the mother.

69
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:20,430
Why do you always say it's not my fault?

70
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,180
You said I'm Seo-woo's mother.

71
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:28,100
Am I really her mother?

72
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:34,980
I'm sorry.

73
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:37,650
I'm sorry.

74
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:43,280
Why are you always

75
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:46,330
sorry

76
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,000
and fine?

77
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:14,020
Cha Yu-ri.

78
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:20,490
Those three syllables
are taboo words to me.

79
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,490
How long

80
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:27,790
will you keep that door shut to me?

81
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:31,750
How long will you
keep that door locked up?

82
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,460
You have to open that door
for me to go in.

83
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:42,050
That's the only way
I can truly be Seo-woo's mom.

84
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:07,570
The pick-up helper.

85
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:15,500
That's her.

86
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,500
Yu-ri.

87
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:20,210
Cha Yu-ri.

88
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,600
What

89
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:38,650
do you...

90
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:42,480
What do you mean?

91
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:50,280
Seo-woo's biological mother.

92
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,200
Cha Yu-ri.

93
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:58,670
She came back to life.

94
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:10,470
I'm sorry, but could you please leave?

95
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,640
I really don't want to see you right now.

96
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:16,770
How... How can you lose her? How?

97
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:50,240
Seo-woo, you're up.

98
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,790
Seo-woo, good morning.
Shall we wash your face?

99
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:01,920
Min-jeong.

100
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:19,560
All done.

101
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:29,650
Okay.

102
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:43,080
Stay here for a minute.

103
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:09,070
Won't you get ready for work? You're late.

104
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:12,650
I know you can't believe it.

105
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,870
Because I couldn't either.

106
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:22,250
No, I don't believe it.

107
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:25,080
It doesn't make sense.

108
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,500
Does this make sense to you?

109
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:29,540
The kitchen assistant.

110
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:32,880
The pick-up helper is Seo-woo's mom?

111
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:34,630
She came back to life?

112
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:37,090
Stop joking around.

113
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:40,010
Why would I make a joke like this?

114
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:43,560
Exactly. Why would someone
joke around like this?

115
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,650
This is the worst you've ever been.

116
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:53,320
It's unbelievable,

117
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:55,700
but it's true.

118
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:56,910
I don't believe it.

119
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:03,160
Then why did you cry so much last night?

120
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,040
Fine.

121
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,960
Let's say what you're saying is true.

122
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,970
Then

123
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:21,350
why did you tell me this

124
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:23,180
now?

125
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,770
I'm sorry.

126
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:37,110
At first, I was flustered,

127
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,740
so I couldn't tell you.

128
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:44,410
But you can't be the only one
who doesn't know.

129
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:47,000
Min-jeong.

130
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,170
Believe it or not,

131
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:52,840
it's true.

132
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:01,220
MISAENG

133
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,480
-Excuse me.
-Gosh.

134
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:11,730
What's up with him?

135
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:13,440
Why are you following me?

136
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:16,110
Can you see me?

137
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:18,110
Do you see ghosts, too?

138
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,320
Can you see me?

139
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,030
Are you on my left or right?

140
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,700
-Where are you?
-Gosh.

141
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:26,750
Darn.

142
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:30,710
No, I'm a Christian.

143
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:33,590
I don't believe in ghosts.

144
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:36,670
I think I believe it a little.

145
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:38,340
I did.

146
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:40,180
It's because I go to fortunetellers.

147
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:42,760
Why did Yu-ri tell me that?

148
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:45,470
Gosh, he's no fun.

149
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,480
Hyeon-jeong.

150
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:56,230
Hyeon-jeong.

151
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:01,990
Hyeon-jeong!

152
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:03,160
Yes. What?

153
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:05,620
How spicy do you want that to be?

154
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,450
Goodness.

155
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,040
-What is it this time?
-Oh, gosh.

156
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,290
Is it because of Yu-ri?

157
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:20,920
Why are you sighing
while talking about Yu-ri?

158
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:22,090
What?

159
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:25,390
You're the one who always sighs
because of her.

160
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,720
I'm just worried about her,
and I feel bad for her.

161
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,600
That's all.

162
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,940
Yu-ri is Seo-woo's mom,

163
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:37,070
so I want to help her,
but it's complicated.

164
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:40,110
That's why I keep sighing.

165
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:42,740
Gang-hwa and you feel the same way, too.

166
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,370
I understand

167
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:48,660
why Yu-ri hid from us

168
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,410
instead of coming to us first.

169
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:54,790
Why?

170
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,340
Everyone is having a hard time
because I came back.

171
00:14:57,420 --> 00:15:00,920
Because of me, Gang-hwa and you
are such in pain.

172
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:03,550
I shouldn't have gotten caught.

173
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:07,800
What is it?

174
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:09,310
Hey.

175
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:14,520
-Watch the shop for me.
-Why?

176
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,900
Where are you going?

177
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:17,560
Hyeon-jeong, don't go.

178
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:20,110
I can't look after the store alone
right now.

179
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,150
I'm in a state of great fear.

180
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:23,950
Hyeon-jeong!

181
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:28,580
Are you out of your mind?

182
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:30,370
How can you take your eyes off her?

183
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:33,660
She was right behind me.

184
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:36,540
It was just for a second.

185
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:38,130
A split second.

186
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:43,840
I knew something was strange last night.

187
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:46,180
Did Gang-hwa's wife say something?

188
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:49,640
Why wouldn't she
when the pick-up helper lost her kid?

189
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:54,730
Gosh, you idiot!

190
00:15:54,810 --> 00:15:57,690
Idiot!

191
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:01,270
-Gosh.
-Goodness.

192
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:07,450
OH MIN-JEONG
I'M SORRY

193
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:21,630
-Pil-seung's family?
-Yes.

194
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:24,340
Guk-bong was grilling them
to find out where Seo-woo was,

195
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:26,760
and they threw a fit not to tell him

196
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:29,220
I heard she was hiding in the playground.

197
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:31,510
Yes, in a slide.

198
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,220
They hid her well.

199
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:35,810
I guess they're pretty loyal.

200
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:39,230
They were taken away from there.

201
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:43,860
Where is Pil-seung's family now?

202
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,410
No way...

203
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,160
They're gone.

204
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:58,120
Come on. Don't mess with me.

205
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:01,920
They're a tenacious bunch.
They've been holding out for 20 years.

206
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,210
They're gone just like that

207
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:06,920
because of Seo-woo?

208
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:09,840
It's been 20 years,
so it's about time they left.

209
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:11,800
They held out a long time.

210
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:15,470
I don't believe it.

211
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,560
Well...

212
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:21,810
They were taken

213
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,690
because they were hiding Seo-woo?

214
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:25,480
It's okay.

215
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,530
They made the choice.

216
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:29,950
They understand how a mother feels.

217
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:35,200
You'll be up there soon.

218
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:38,290
Thank them when you get there.

219
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,050
I should cook for Pil-seung one more time.

220
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:48,880
Like you got enough time.

221
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:51,470
Don't worry about others.

222
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:53,550
Enjoy what you can while you're here.

223
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,260
You idiot.

224
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:02,900
I can't believe
what Pil-seung's family did.

225
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:04,860
I'm so grateful.

226
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:10,320
But I can't thank them
because they're gone.

227
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:14,490
-Yu-ri.
-Yes, Mom?

228
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:16,910
Come out. Hyeon-jeong is here.

229
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:19,330
Really?

230
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,000
What is it?

231
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,540
Hyeon-jeong is here.

232
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,080
Okay.

233
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,180
Hey.

234
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:38,010
What is this?

235
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:40,640
Hey, hop in.

236
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,650
Hyeon-jeong.

237
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:45,900
What's all this? Where did you get it?

238
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:48,270
Why do you even ask? I'm a hip like this.

239
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,530
Get in.

240
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,150
-Is it really okay?
-Sure.

241
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:55,070
Yeon-ji. Bring your sister's bag.

242
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:58,450
My gosh.

243
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,620
What are you waiting for? Hop in.

244
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:16,850
All right then. Shall we go?

245
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:18,140
Where are we going?

246
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:19,970
Anywhere.

247
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:21,810
We can go anywhere you want.

248
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:27,900
Now she smiles.

249
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,570
Gosh, I can tell they are soul mates.

250
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:36,530
Mom, I think Hyeon-jeong
is the best. Right?

251
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:57,010
-Yu-ri, do you like it?
-I love it.

252
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,680
It feels so refreshing!

253
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,970
I like it too!

254
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:03,470
All right. Let's go.

255
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,680
One.

256
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:06,770
Two. Three!

257
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:11,480
This is amazing.

258
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:16,910
It must be fun.

259
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:18,740
-Yu-ri.
-Yes?

260
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:21,660
Are you all right?
Do you want to go back down now?

261
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:22,580
I'm fine.

262
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:24,870
You don't seem fine though.

263
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:26,250
I'm okay.

264
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,830
-Of course, I am.
-Hyeon-jeong.

265
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:32,380
Gosh, no. This isn't right.

266
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:35,130
No!

267
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:37,720
Yu-ri.

268
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:39,640
Hyeon-jeong.

269
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,790
I love the scenery.

270
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:19,880
Hyeon-jeong, hurry.

271
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,170
Is this for me?

272
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:22,740
DON'T JOKE AROUND LIKE THAT AGAIN

273
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:40,670
OPERATION SCHEDULE

274
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,510
My operation is tomorrow.

275
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:45,720
I said I don't want to do this.

276
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,720
-Why not?
-Just because.

277
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,850
I'm not doing it.

278
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:51,520
Why?

279
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,900
Why do you not want to do this?

280
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:55,770
You've been doing well
with the counseling.

281
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:57,610
You need to face this to get better.

282
00:22:57,690 --> 00:23:00,820
Will you keep living as a doctor
who can't operate?

283
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,660
Maybe later.

284
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,490
I'll do it some other time.

285
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:07,830
When would it be?

286
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,750
It's about time
to stop torturing yourself.

287
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:21,960
-Here.
-Thanks.

288
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:25,590
Now you look like Cha Yu-ri.

289
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,720
Yu-ri.

290
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:31,180
Yes?

291
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:32,980
For the past five years,

292
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:38,060
were you around me as well?

293
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:42,610
Sure. I stuck around you all the time.

294
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:48,030
Even I forgot my birthday,
but you remembered it every year.

295
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:52,540
Maybe I was struggling not to forget you.

296
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:55,920
I guess that's why.

297
00:23:57,630 --> 00:23:58,750
After you left,

298
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:01,550
it didn't really hit me at first.

299
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:04,010
When I studied abroad,

300
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:06,510
we didn't see each other for about a year.

301
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,640
It was like that.

302
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:12,390
I felt like you were just away
for a little bit.

303
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:19,770
And once I realized that I would
never be able to see you again,

304
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:23,030
I couldn't even eat.

305
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:25,360
I just cried my eyes out.

306
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:29,370
But after a little while,

307
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,120
I felt hungry again.

308
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,710
So I started to eat,

309
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,670
take care of Ha-jun,

310
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:38,880
and work.

311
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,130
And one day,

312
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:48,510
I realized that

313
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:51,100
I was forgetting about you.

314
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:55,390
I just celebrated your birthdays

315
00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:58,270
because I wanted to cling on to you.

316
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:01,020
Because I was sorry for you.

317
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:05,570
And you knew it, right?

318
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,610
Of course, I did.

319
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,990
Actually I was sad
that you were forgetting about me.

320
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,240
But

321
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:19,790
I was afraid if I wouldn't be forgotten.

322
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:25,960
Watching people
have hard times because of me,

323
00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:28,800
was real hell.

324
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:31,340
Gang-hwa?

325
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:37,480
So you knew it too.

326
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,020
That Gang-hwa has a problem.

327
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:43,440
I do. I was around him all the time.

328
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:47,030
He recently received a probation.

329
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:48,780
I found out about it later on though.

330
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:54,410
That's what I did to him.

331
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:56,910
I broke his heart.

332
00:25:56,990 --> 00:25:58,790
It's not your fault.

333
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:01,210
Isn't it like you died
because you wanted to.

334
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,590
But it was my choice.

335
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:09,550
I just made him feel guilty.

336
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:32,110
Where did she go leaving me alone?

337
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:36,030
Oh, right.

338
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:38,620
That's right.

339
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:46,960

00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:50,340
SEO BONG-YEON

341
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:06,020
I know you're a stone-hearted human,

342
00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:10,940
but how could you send them up
just like that?

343
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:12,490
My point.

344
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:14,990
I didn't even get to say goodbye. Damn it.

345
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:22,290
You guys are not human.

346
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:25,580
To Guk-bong...

347
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:27,880
I mean, to people,

348
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:30,500
you guys are just demons
who should be sent up.

349
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:32,300
How could you say something so harsh?

350
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:33,590
I know.

351
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:36,590
So if you don't want to get caught
and sent up all of a sudden like them,

352
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,550
stop avoiding Guk-bong

353
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:43,060
and get over your regrets in this world.

354
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:48,060
This is really frustrating.

355
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:56,860
Hello?

356
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:58,240
Hello, ma'am.

357
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:00,490
Do you make domiciliary visits?

358
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:01,830
What?

359
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:10,420
Min-jeong. Believe it or not,

360
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:12,300
it's true.

361
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:31,150
What are you doing?

362
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:33,280
Get off, Yu-ri.

363
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:37,530
You said we'd hang out at my place.

364
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:39,620
We will drink. So I can't drive.

365
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:40,700
Let's walk.

366
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
I'm hungry. Let's go.

367
00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:02,300
-I'm so hungry.
-Me too.

368
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:04,390
-I shouted too much.
-I know.

369
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:07,440
I couldn't help it
because you drove so fast.

370
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,280
-Is it here?
-Yes.

371
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,360
It's for us.

372
00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:22,320
-It just came right on time.
-I know.

373
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,410
-Please enjoy.
-Thank you.

374
00:29:24,490 --> 00:29:26,000
It's pork belly meat.

375
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,500
-Let's go.
-Mom, Yu-ri and Hyeon-jeong are here.

376
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:30,750
Gosh, I can't wait.

377
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:34,340
-Let's eat.
-It must be really good.

378
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:37,130
Hello, Ms. Jeon.

379
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:49,980
CHA MU-PUNG, JEON EUN-SUK,
CHA YU-RI, CHA YEON-JI

380
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:29,850
-It looks delicious.
-It's warm.

381
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:30,940
My goodness.

382
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:33,100
-I'm hungry.
-It looks great.

383
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:36,070
Here's a cold beer for you.

384
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:37,900
Yeon-ji, you're the best.

385
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:39,440
We have five drinkers here.

386
00:30:39,530 --> 00:30:41,360
This is far from enough.

387
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:43,240
I don't drink beer.

388
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,280
I like soju.

389
00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:47,740
I knew it. You're so my type.

390
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:50,500
Mom, I'll get you soju.

391
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:51,870
Here, Dad.

392
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,290
-My daughter is the best.
-Gosh.

393
00:30:53,370 --> 00:30:54,420
It's good, isn't it?

394
00:30:55,670 --> 00:30:58,050
-This is nice.
-Dad, please open this for me.

395
00:30:58,130 --> 00:30:59,510
Give me that.

396
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:01,050
All right.

397
00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:04,220
It's open.

398
00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:07,100
It flew away like this.

399
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,100
Let's drink.

400
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:11,180
Here. Have some of this.

401
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:12,980
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

402
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:14,940
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

403
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:20,440
It tastes so good.

404
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:26,620
So we're all together with Hyeon-jeong.

405
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:28,490
It's been so long since we did this.

406
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:29,740
I know.

407
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:32,660
I've been too busy
working and raising my kid.

408
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:35,540
She was just afraid
she would remind us of Yu-ri,

409
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:37,590
so she was being thoughtful.

410
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:40,050
Do you think I don't know that?

411
00:31:42,170 --> 00:31:43,760
I had no idea

412
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:47,470
this day would come again.

413
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:49,810
What are you doing, Dad? This isn't right.

414
00:31:49,890 --> 00:31:53,180
She's right. Why are you being so silly?

415
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:54,560
Okay. I get it.

416
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,480
-I'm done. It's over.
-It's over.

417
00:31:56,810 --> 00:31:59,650
-Mr. Cha, please stop.
-What's over?

418
00:31:59,730 --> 00:32:02,570
It's nothing.
Your dad is just being silly again.

419
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:04,610
Do you say things like that?

420
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:05,780
Sure.

421
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:06,990
She says all kinds of stuff.

422
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:09,120
-Gosh, Dad.
-Stop it.

423
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:12,830
-It tastes good.
-So

424
00:32:13,370 --> 00:32:14,790
did you guys have fun?

425
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:16,120
Yes. We had a lot of fun.

426
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:19,500
Hyeon-jeong's driving has improved a lot.
She was too afraid to run at 50km before.

427
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:20,880
Hey, that was a long time ago.

428
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:24,880
That's not true.
I was a novice driver back then.

429
00:32:24,970 --> 00:32:27,300
Still, 50km is too slow.

430
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:30,180
Here, Yu-ri. Try this.

431
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:32,510
You seem to have only one daughter.

432
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,850
You're my son. All right.

433
00:32:34,930 --> 00:32:37,690
I didn't know I was a son.

434
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:41,480
All right. I should give this to my son.

435
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:43,820
Here. Good.

436
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:45,650
Why don't we take a picture together?

437
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:47,360
-Good.
-Let's do that.

438
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:48,860
Do I look okay?

439
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:50,700
-You look perfect.
-You look beautiful.

440
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:52,530
-Don't worry.
-You're always pretty.

441
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:53,540
I'll put this on here.

442
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:55,830
Gather together and look at the camera.

443
00:32:55,910 --> 00:32:57,210
Mr. Cha, come closer.

444
00:32:57,290 --> 00:32:58,830
One...

445
00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:00,500
Come closer to each other.

446
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:03,170
-One...
-Is it how it works?

447
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:06,550
Let me see the picture.

448
00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:08,630
I'll show you.

449
00:35:08,170 --> 00:35:11,260
I'm very grateful to Hyeon-jeong.

450
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,930
I'm always grateful to her.

451
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:16,890
Did you like it, Yu-ri?

452
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:19,220
Yes. I loved it.

453
00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:22,770
What was so good?

454
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:26,730
I liked the wind,

455
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:28,270
I liked the air,

456
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,280
and I liked Hyeon-jeong next to me.

457
00:35:31,650 --> 00:35:33,030
I'm glad to hear that.

458
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:36,910
Things will be always like that
from now on.

459
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:40,990
We will have happy moments
like that every day, Yu-ri.

460
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:46,880
Do you not want it?

461
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:49,250
Of course, I want it.

462
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:53,720
What?

463
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:56,800
Dad.

464
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:58,470
Is Dad sleeping already?

465
00:35:59,470 --> 00:36:03,100
Dad, you can't sleep here.

466
00:36:03,930 --> 00:36:06,440
-My gosh.
-It's been less than a minute.

467
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:09,690
It was somewhere around here. Where is it?

468
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,530
There it is. It says Misaeng.

469
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,740
What is he doing here?

470
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,120
Hey.

471
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,370
Gosh, it hurts.

472
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:28,000
-It hurts.
-What are you doing here?

473
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,630
Gosh, it's not like that.

474
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:30,840
Let go of me.

475
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,630
-It really hurts.
-Come here.

476
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:37,930
Come here. I got you.

477
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:40,640
-Just follow me.
-It hurts.

478
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:41,970
Hello.

479
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:45,140
Stay still. Stop.

480
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:47,640
What's with your arms?

481
00:36:48,850 --> 00:36:49,980
Is something there?

482
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:52,360
What have you been up to these days?

483
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:54,320
Why is there a ghost around you?

484
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,030
What? A ghost?

485
00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:57,530
-Stay still.
-Ghost?

486
00:36:57,610 --> 00:36:59,450
I told you to stand still!

487
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:00,660
Isn't it staying still?

488
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:03,450
-It hurts.
-Stop it. Stay still.

489
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,750
Is he always so stupid like that?

490
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,010
Because she's not here.

491
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:17,670
Who?

492
00:37:18,010 --> 00:37:18,970
His wife.

493
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:20,300
He's Hyeon-jeong's boy.

494
00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:22,390
Hyeon-jeong. Where are you?

495
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:26,810
Hurry and come right away, Hyeon-jeong.

496
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:31,310
Gosh, you now know Yu-ri was around you
for five years.

497
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,940
Just come over here.

498
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:36,570
I didn't know about it.

499
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:38,570
Are you sure

500
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,570
there's a ghost next to you?

501
00:37:41,450 --> 00:37:44,030
Why? Why is it doing this to me?

502
00:37:44,410 --> 00:37:46,540
Is it because I refused
to write a fake diagnosis?

503
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:49,210
Gosh, it's no big deal.

504
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:54,380
"Gosh, it's no big deal."

505
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:57,170
Then why?

506
00:37:58,090 --> 00:37:59,550
Why are you hanging around with him?

507
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:01,550
Right. That one.

508
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:02,760
There's something

509
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:05,850
only he can do for me.

510
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:09,640
What?

511
00:38:11,770 --> 00:38:13,400
What is it?

512
00:38:13,770 --> 00:38:16,270
Ms. Mi-dong, please tell me what he says.

513
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,780
Why? Why is he doing this to me?

514
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:21,360
So there's something
only you can do for him.

515
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:23,950
What is it?

516
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:29,870
Please tell my mom

517
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:31,670
that I didn't

518
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:34,790
kill myself.

519
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:42,550
He knows that it wasn't a suicide.

520
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,970
What does he say?

521
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:48,520
What is it? What?

522
00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:51,600
Ms. Mi-dong, please.
I need a simultaneous interpretation.

523
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:53,600
I can't wait.

524
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:56,270
I'm very anxious.

525
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:27,850
It must've been fun

526
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:36,520
to see how much I loved her
like some kind of an idiot.

527
00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:45,820
No, it wasn't like that.

528
00:39:48,490 --> 00:39:50,240
Do you know what I said?

529
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,580
I said I'm curious about her
because she looks like Seo-woo's mom.

530
00:39:57,580 --> 00:39:58,840
That I'm envious

531
00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:01,670
because she looks like Seo-woo.

532
00:40:04,130 --> 00:40:05,340
I had no idea.

533
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:08,850
I was like a fool.

534
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:24,070
You should've told me first.

535
00:40:29,950 --> 00:40:31,790
That's what you should've done.

536
00:40:42,090 --> 00:40:44,300
It has been a while

537
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,550
since you looked so happy

538
00:40:50,970 --> 00:40:53,520
when you were around other people.

539
00:40:56,810 --> 00:40:58,020
I was afraid

540
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:01,650
you would get hurt.

541
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,320
I'm sorry.

542
00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:24,550
Before caring about my happiness,

543
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:28,430
you should care about yours.

544
00:41:30,590 --> 00:41:32,430
Before seeing my wound,

545
00:41:32,930 --> 00:41:34,930
you should take care of yours first.

546
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:40,850
You're a mess.

547
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:54,450
Why do you keep
torturing yourself like that?

548
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:25,440
-Is everything going well for lunch?
-Yes.

549
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:27,730
Director.

550
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:31,200
Is Seo-woo here yet?

551
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:34,410
She's supposed to be here by now,
but I haven't seen her yet.

552
00:42:34,490 --> 00:42:36,950
Seo-woo is not coming today.

553
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:39,330
Why not? Is she sick?

554
00:42:39,410 --> 00:42:40,710
No.

555
00:42:41,210 --> 00:42:43,630
She will stay home with her mom today.

556
00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:45,920
I see.

557
00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:47,590
Okay.

558
00:42:57,220 --> 00:42:59,930
I'M SORRY

559
00:43:08,070 --> 00:43:09,360
CONTACTS

560
00:43:11,110 --> 00:43:13,320
CHO GANG-HWA

561
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:49,980
Why do you always say
everything is all right?

562
00:43:50,110 --> 00:43:52,900
It's not all right at all.
You aren't all right.

563
00:43:52,990 --> 00:43:54,490
Why are you always

564
00:43:56,070 --> 00:43:58,990
sorry and fine?

565
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:09,210
Before seeing my wound,

566
00:44:09,790 --> 00:44:11,840
you should take care of yours first.

567
00:44:13,630 --> 00:44:15,550
You're a mess.

568
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:36,610
OPERATION SCHEDULE

569
00:44:52,630 --> 00:44:54,300
So he's not doing this?

570
00:44:55,670 --> 00:44:57,800
He's getting counseling.

571
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:00,100
But why isn't he doing this?

572
00:45:00,430 --> 00:45:03,680
He should go to the place
where he got traumatized.

573
00:45:03,770 --> 00:45:07,560
I guess he's afraid to bring up things
that he's been avoiding and correct them.

574
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:15,990
What was it? The exposure therapy?

575
00:45:16,190 --> 00:45:17,070
I'll do it.

576
00:45:17,650 --> 00:45:18,740
OPERATION SCHEDULE

577
00:45:19,910 --> 00:45:20,870
Why?

578
00:45:24,990 --> 00:45:26,330
You said you wouldn't do it.

579
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:28,370
What made you change your mind?

580
00:45:29,210 --> 00:45:31,170
I can't keep living like this.

581
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:34,090
Do I need to just observe the operation?

582
00:45:34,170 --> 00:45:35,380
For now.

583
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:38,010
The goal is to gradually expose you
to the place you're afraid of

584
00:45:38,090 --> 00:45:39,340
so you get used to it.

585
00:45:39,930 --> 00:45:40,760
Okay.

586
00:45:45,310 --> 00:45:47,640
I think Doctor Cho will get better.

587
00:45:47,930 --> 00:45:49,390
What he said is a good sign.

588
00:45:49,690 --> 00:45:51,810
He said, "I can't keep living like this."

589
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:53,940
Not "just because."

590
00:45:59,570 --> 00:46:02,280
Of course, she's angry at me.
I lost her kid.

591
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:06,790
Still, I don't have much time left.

592
00:46:07,620 --> 00:46:09,540
I really need to see Seo-woo.

593
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:14,880
Should I go beg for forgiveness?

594
00:46:22,970 --> 00:46:24,100
Mom!

595
00:46:27,310 --> 00:46:28,390
Hey.

596
00:46:29,140 --> 00:46:30,190
Where are you going?

597
00:46:30,270 --> 00:46:32,100
I have a doctor's appointment.

598
00:46:32,190 --> 00:46:33,190
I'm going to the hospital.

599
00:46:33,270 --> 00:46:34,940
Right, it's Monday today.

600
00:46:35,570 --> 00:46:36,860
How did you know that?

601
00:46:37,690 --> 00:46:39,860
Well, Yeon-ji told me.

602
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:41,320
Can I come with you?

603
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:42,820
-You want to?
-Yes.

604
00:47:23,070 --> 00:47:26,620
Your heart starts racing
whenever you see a crosswalk.

605
00:47:57,730 --> 00:47:59,570
I thought I was getting by,

606
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:04,700
but seeing a crosswalk would always
get my heart racing.

607
00:48:05,410 --> 00:48:07,700
I didn't try to remember it or anything,

608
00:48:08,830 --> 00:48:10,540
but my body must have remembered it.

609
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:13,160
I'm okay now.

610
00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:16,750
Wouldn't it be strange
if I didn't change at all

611
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:18,500
after what happened?

612
00:48:19,130 --> 00:48:20,500
I'm only human after all.

613
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:36,060
What's with him now?

614
00:48:39,110 --> 00:48:40,190
Doctor Gye.

615
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:41,690
Gosh, you startled me.

616
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:45,070
What is it? What do you need?

617
00:48:45,150 --> 00:48:47,240
Why are you not in your office?

618
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:52,740
There are people here.

619
00:48:52,830 --> 00:48:54,080
Pardon?

620
00:48:58,370 --> 00:49:00,460
Well, you know...

621
00:49:01,710 --> 00:49:03,840
Someone asked me a favor,

622
00:49:04,550 --> 00:49:06,970
but I'm not sure if I should say yes.

623
00:49:07,050 --> 00:49:09,510
Say yes if it isn't something
extremely difficult.

624
00:49:09,590 --> 00:49:11,970
It's not like a dead person asked you
a favor, so why not?

625
00:49:12,390 --> 00:49:14,020
-A dead person asked me a favor.
-Pardon?

626
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:16,520
Nothing. Never mind.

627
00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:18,440
It's nothing.

628
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:21,400
Shouldn't you go check on Doctor Cho?

629
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:23,820
Cho Gang-hwa? Why? Should I?

630
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:26,780
He's attending Doctor Jang's surgery
today. Everyone's been fussing.

631
00:49:26,860 --> 00:49:27,900
What?

632
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:41,210
Gang-hwa, you're attending surgery?

633
00:49:41,540 --> 00:49:42,710
Exposure therapy?

634
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:43,960
Yes.

635
00:49:44,130 --> 00:49:46,090
Will you be all right?
I don't think you're ready.

636
00:49:47,050 --> 00:49:48,380
It can't be that bad.

637
00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:50,510
If you start hyperventilating,

638
00:49:50,890 --> 00:49:52,430
remember to take deep breaths.

639
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:54,640
Get out as soon as it starts
getting bad, okay?

640
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:33,260
RESTRICTED AREA

641
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:10,720
Mom, why did you stop going to Gang-hwa?

642
00:51:10,970 --> 00:51:13,050
He knows your heart
better than any other doctor.

643
00:51:13,260 --> 00:51:15,140
My condition is nothing serious.

644
00:51:15,890 --> 00:51:18,510
What's the point of seeing him regularly

645
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:21,430
and reminding him of his pain?

646
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:25,650
I thought it'd be best
to stop seeing him altogether.

647
00:51:28,770 --> 00:51:30,150
Ms. Jeon Eun-suk.

648
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:32,860
-I'll be right back. Stay here.
-Okay.

649
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:42,120
What happened?

650
00:51:42,210 --> 00:51:44,500
I heard Doctor Cho attended surgery today.

651
00:51:45,580 --> 00:51:47,590
-Again?
-Only ten minutes in,

652
00:51:47,670 --> 00:51:49,500
his symptoms appeared, and he rushed out.

653
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:51,050
My gosh.

654
00:52:01,020 --> 00:52:02,060
Gang-hwa.

655
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:03,560
Where is he?

656
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:05,440
I'm not sure. He rushed out.

657
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:06,900
I don't know where he went.

658
00:52:07,150 --> 00:52:09,400
How was he? Did he handle it okay?

659
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:10,570
No.

660
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:14,740
-Go look for him.
-Okay.

661
00:52:38,050 --> 00:52:39,260
Have you seen Doctor Cho?

662
00:52:39,350 --> 00:52:40,680
-No.
-Gosh.

663
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:29,770
Gang-hwa, look at me.

664
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:35,610
Breathe.

665
00:53:36,190 --> 00:53:37,450
It's okay.

666
00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:38,860
It's okay.

667
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:42,070
It's okay. Breathe slowly.

668
00:53:53,250 --> 00:53:55,000
It's okay.

669
00:53:55,300 --> 00:53:56,210
Everything's okay.

670
00:54:55,310 --> 00:54:57,070
Breathe, okay?

671
00:55:05,950 --> 00:55:07,540
Breathe.

672
00:55:11,330 --> 00:55:12,370
Breathe.

673
00:55:25,390 --> 00:55:27,510
Gang-hwa, are you okay?

674
00:55:28,430 --> 00:55:29,770
Breathe.

675
00:55:42,190 --> 00:55:43,700
Go ahead and breathe.

676
00:55:49,660 --> 00:55:50,950
Why did you do that?

677
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,330
Why did you do that?

678
00:55:58,040 --> 00:56:00,800
Why? Why did you leave me all alone?

679
00:56:05,890 --> 00:56:07,220
Why did you?

680
00:56:09,220 --> 00:56:10,680
Why did you do that?

681
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:14,730
Why?

682
00:56:15,730 --> 00:56:18,560
We have to operate on him first.
Otherwise, he's going to die!

683
00:56:18,650 --> 00:56:21,070
I said, no! Transfer him.

684
00:56:21,150 --> 00:56:22,900
I'm ready! Why can't I operate on him?

685
00:56:22,990 --> 00:56:23,860
I can save him!

686
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:25,610
The other patient is a VIP!

687
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:27,740
Do as you're told.

688
00:56:27,870 --> 00:56:30,030
I can't cover for you anymore.

689
00:56:30,580 --> 00:56:32,910
Go to the other operating room.

690
00:56:35,830 --> 00:56:37,000
I can't.

691
00:56:41,380 --> 00:56:42,210
Get him.

692
00:56:43,090 --> 00:56:45,170
-Get him!
-Yes, Doctor.

693
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:51,720
Lock the door.

694
00:56:51,810 --> 00:56:52,720
Pardon?

695
00:56:54,020 --> 00:56:55,350
I said, lock the door.

696
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:57,020
Well. Okay.

697
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:59,610
-Intercoms off.
-Okay.

698
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:05,280
Don't open the door or answer your phone
until the surgery is over.

699
00:57:09,740 --> 00:57:11,160
The door is locked.

700
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:13,160
That punk.

701
00:57:16,620 --> 00:57:19,210
Doctor Jang,
a pregnant traffic accident patient.

702
00:57:19,380 --> 00:57:20,840
Please come with us.

703
00:57:36,730 --> 00:57:37,890
Call Gang-hwa.

704
00:57:38,020 --> 00:57:38,980
Pardon?

705
00:57:39,190 --> 00:57:41,020
I said, call Gang-hwa! Right now!

706
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:54,580
Where's Gang-hwa? You couldn't reach him?

707
00:57:54,660 --> 00:57:56,040
No.

708
00:57:56,410 --> 00:57:59,580
If we wait any longer,
we'll lose both mother and child.

709
00:58:10,010 --> 00:58:11,140
Doctor.

710
00:58:12,050 --> 00:58:13,260
My baby...

711
00:58:13,890 --> 00:58:16,270
Please save my baby first.

712
00:58:17,310 --> 00:58:18,600
My baby...

713
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:22,150
Please save her.

714
00:58:23,060 --> 00:58:24,690
Please save her first.

715
00:58:26,730 --> 00:58:28,690
-Doctor Cho.
-Yes?

716
00:58:28,900 --> 00:58:29,950
Your wife

717
00:58:31,570 --> 00:58:32,820
had an accident.

718
00:59:05,060 --> 00:59:06,730
Yu-ri, wake up.

719
00:59:08,190 --> 00:59:09,070
Yu-ri!

720
00:59:16,490 --> 00:59:17,620
Why did you do that?

721
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:20,080
Why?

722
00:59:57,830 --> 00:59:59,580
You should have lived.

723
01:00:02,370 --> 01:00:03,500
You should have...

724
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:07,710
You should have lived.

725
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:11,130
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

726
01:00:11,300 --> 01:00:12,970
I'm sorry for everything.

727
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:17,390
Stop blaming yourself.

728
01:00:18,050 --> 01:00:19,260
It's not your fault.

729
01:00:31,900 --> 01:00:33,820
Resentment, guilt, and regret...

730
01:00:33,900 --> 01:00:35,280
All those emotions are entangled.

731
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:38,120
But mostly, he'd feel guilty.

732
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:41,040
He'd think things would've been different

733
01:00:41,790 --> 01:00:43,790
if he hadn't been in surgery that day.

734
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:46,670
So he blames himself?

735
01:00:47,290 --> 01:00:48,290
Yes.

736
01:00:48,710 --> 01:00:51,420
And the person who caused
all these emotions is gone.

737
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:52,710
She died.

738
01:00:53,010 --> 01:00:55,760
So he had to bottle everything up
and got sick as a result.

739
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:13,650
PICK-UP HELPER DO-YEON
I'M SORRY.

740
01:02:17,380 --> 01:02:20,010
You'll damage your stomach.
Have some food too.

741
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:29,270
It's a start.

742
01:02:29,350 --> 01:02:31,190
Ten minutes is impressive.

743
01:02:31,270 --> 01:02:33,110
It'll only get better.

744
01:02:36,730 --> 01:02:38,110
Where were you?

745
01:02:38,190 --> 01:02:40,030
They couldn't find you anywhere.

746
01:02:40,110 --> 01:02:40,990
Well...

747
01:02:41,530 --> 01:02:42,870
I was where I always go.

748
01:02:44,990 --> 01:02:47,240
So what made you
want to receive treatment?

749
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:57,170
She wants me to let her go.

750
01:02:58,510 --> 01:02:59,550
And I think

751
01:03:00,670 --> 01:03:02,220
it might be time

752
01:03:03,140 --> 01:03:04,300
to let her go

753
01:03:06,180 --> 01:03:07,470
since she came back to life.

754
01:03:08,770 --> 01:03:10,100
What are you talking about?

755
01:03:13,810 --> 01:03:15,400
Can't you try to keep

756
01:03:16,980 --> 01:03:19,190
only the good memories
and forget the sad ones?

757
01:03:23,490 --> 01:03:25,450
Only the good memories...

758
01:03:26,030 --> 01:03:27,780
Only the happy memories...

759
01:03:28,910 --> 01:03:30,910
If I kept only those,

760
01:03:31,830 --> 01:03:33,870
I wouldn't be here right now.

761
01:03:34,080 --> 01:03:35,210
Why not?

762
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:42,130
I'd miss her too much.

763
01:03:47,350 --> 01:03:48,930
I'd miss her too much.

764
01:03:49,970 --> 01:03:51,640
When I missed her like crazy,

765
01:03:54,520 --> 01:03:56,520
she wouldn't even show up in my dreams.

766
01:04:29,890 --> 01:04:30,970
Yu-ri?

767
01:04:31,060 --> 01:04:32,060
Yes.

768
01:04:33,930 --> 01:04:36,350
I went there as soon as I heard
Gang-hwa rushed out in a panic,

769
01:04:36,850 --> 01:04:38,110
but Yu-ri was already there.

770
01:04:38,190 --> 01:04:39,980
How did she know where...

771
01:04:42,610 --> 01:04:45,450
-Oh...
-She watched him for five years.

772
01:04:45,530 --> 01:04:47,070
She saw how much he suffered too.

773
01:04:50,490 --> 01:04:51,540
That's right.

774
01:04:52,040 --> 01:04:53,370
How did she watch all that?

775
01:04:53,450 --> 01:04:54,620
I know.

776
01:04:55,830 --> 01:04:58,130
She was right there,
watching him suffer because of her.

777
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:01,800
She cried, apologizing to him.
It was too painful to watch.

778
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:03,420
Why would she apologize?

779
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:05,220
She is the most unfortunate one.

780
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,880
FAMILY AND HYEON-JEONG

781
01:06:19,370 --> 01:06:21,170
I want to live too.

782
01:06:36,810 --> 01:06:38,180
What are you doing?

783
01:06:40,350 --> 01:06:41,520
Do you know

784
01:06:42,900 --> 01:06:44,560
what's more desperate

785
01:06:45,650 --> 01:06:47,440
than saying, "I want to die"?

786
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:49,570
What is it?

787
01:06:52,410 --> 01:06:53,780
"I want to live."

788
01:06:54,660 --> 01:06:57,490
What are you talking about,
all of a sudden?

789
01:06:58,330 --> 01:06:59,200
Yu-ri says

790
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:03,330
she wants to live.

791
01:07:05,380 --> 01:07:08,260
Shouldn't she live if she wants to?

792
01:07:08,340 --> 01:07:10,720
I don't know what you're talking about.

793
01:07:11,130 --> 01:07:12,800
We were talking about Gang-hwa and Yu-ri.

794
01:07:13,930 --> 01:07:15,180
And Yu-ri is alive.

795
01:07:17,640 --> 01:07:18,520
Yu-ri...

796
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:25,810
Yu-ri

797
01:07:28,110 --> 01:07:29,530
is going to die soon.

798
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:34,070
She's going to die again soon.

799
01:07:37,080 --> 01:07:38,620
What are you talking about?

800
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:50,130
What did you just say?

801
01:07:53,630 --> 01:07:54,890
Yu-ri is

802
01:07:57,600 --> 01:07:58,470
going to die?

803
01:08:11,900 --> 01:08:13,150
Why is Yu-ri dying?

804
01:08:16,620 --> 01:08:19,030
Why is Yu-ri dying again?

805
01:08:22,450 --> 01:08:24,540
What did you say?

806
01:08:25,620 --> 01:08:26,710
Can I

807
01:08:27,750 --> 01:08:28,960
live?

808
01:08:33,590 --> 01:08:34,880
I want to live.

809
01:08:35,180 --> 01:08:36,840
I want to live, Ms. Mi-dong.

810
01:08:38,050 --> 01:08:39,550
What did I do so wrong?

811
01:08:40,140 --> 01:08:42,890
Is everything my fault?

812
01:08:44,390 --> 01:08:45,940
I wanted to live,

813
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:47,560
and I still do.

814
01:08:49,650 --> 01:08:51,900
Seo-woo, Mom, Dad...

815
01:08:52,150 --> 01:08:54,240
I want to be with them for a long time.

816
01:09:03,620 --> 01:09:04,500
Yu-ri.

817
01:09:05,790 --> 01:09:06,620
Yes?

818
01:09:07,330 --> 01:09:08,710
In the past five years,

819
01:09:10,540 --> 01:09:12,590
when was the moment
you felt the most frustrated

820
01:09:13,710 --> 01:09:15,090
and wished you were alive?

821
01:09:23,390 --> 01:09:24,560
Right now.

822
01:09:26,980 --> 01:09:29,440
I've never wished for it
more than I do right now.

823
01:09:33,900 --> 01:09:34,900
Can I

824
01:09:36,530 --> 01:09:37,700
live?

825
01:09:52,670 --> 01:09:54,210
VIP patients?

826
01:09:54,750 --> 01:09:56,130
They get surgery first?

827
01:09:56,920 --> 01:09:59,010
Yes, it's been going on

828
01:09:59,090 --> 01:10:01,050
secretly for years.

829
01:10:01,220 --> 01:10:03,680
Everyone knows it's wrong,
but no one has dared to speak up.

830
01:10:04,180 --> 01:10:07,230
And you're trying to change it now?

831
01:10:07,310 --> 01:10:10,230
Yes, he's going to submit a petition
signed by all the doctors.

832
01:10:10,310 --> 01:10:12,060
What if you get fired or something?

833
01:10:12,150 --> 01:10:14,110
Don't worry. That's never going to happen.

834
01:10:14,190 --> 01:10:15,860
I'm the best surgeon at our hospital.

835
01:10:16,440 --> 01:10:17,400
All right.

836
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:20,610
Surgery should be performed
based on urgency.

837
01:10:20,700 --> 01:10:23,870
Money shouldn't decide
who gets treated first.

838
01:10:23,950 --> 01:10:27,250
That's my husband. Isn't he amazing?

839
01:10:27,330 --> 01:10:28,660
He really is.

840
01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:30,790
My son-in-law is a real doctor.

841
01:10:31,460 --> 01:10:33,080
You're the best.

842
01:10:34,460 --> 01:10:36,670
DOCTOR CHO, THANK YOU SO MUCH

843
01:10:36,760 --> 01:10:39,170
WITHOUT YOUR HELP THAT DAY

844
01:10:39,300 --> 01:10:41,840
MY HUSBAND WOULDN'T BE ALIVE TODAY

845
01:10:41,930 --> 01:10:44,600
THANK YOU AND THANK YOU

846
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:35,690
Gang-hwa.

847
01:11:38,820 --> 01:11:39,690
I'm sorry.

848
01:11:40,150 --> 01:11:41,400
I'm sorry.

849
01:11:42,150 --> 01:11:43,360
I'm sorry.

850
01:11:45,320 --> 01:11:46,280
I'm sorry.

851
01:11:46,370 --> 01:11:48,700
It's not your fault, you idiot.

852
01:11:49,740 --> 01:11:51,370
They said it was too late.

853
01:11:51,450 --> 01:11:53,540
Even if they'd reached you,

854
01:11:57,040 --> 01:11:59,590
it would've been too late to save Yu-ri.

855
01:12:05,090 --> 01:12:06,180
I'm sorry.

856
01:12:06,340 --> 01:12:09,350
This misfortune that struck you
out of the blue

857
01:12:10,770 --> 01:12:12,350
is not your fault.

858
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:15,560
I'm sorry.

859
01:12:49,550 --> 01:12:51,560
