1
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,250
What are you talking about?

2
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:52,420
You can't go.
Your due date is the day after tomorrow.

3
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,420
Goodness. It's okay, Mom.

4
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,130
It won't kill me.

5
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:58,550
I know it's work, but you're almost--

6
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:02,590
Okay. I'll finish it quickly,
and go straight home.

7
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:04,010
My goodness.

8
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:07,390
There's no stopping her.

9
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:10,940
Gosh, it's already a quarter to two.

10
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,020
Is Yu-ri going somewhere?

11
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:17,070
Someone who bought her work
asked her to fix something.

12
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:20,110
She's due soon,
she shouldn't be going around.

13
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,400
Why didn't you stop her?

14
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:23,030
You know she doesn't listen to me.

15
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:27,540
She said she'd be quick,
so she'll be fine.

16
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:31,660
So, what did you say you dreamed about?

17
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:33,670
I don't know. I don't remember.

18
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:36,290
I woke up this morning feeling weird.

19
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,090
I feel uneasy.

20
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:40,590
It probably means nothing
since you don't remember.

21
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:47,470
Goodness, it's all done.

22
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,440
Hello?

23
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:00,110
Yes, it is.

24
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:13,250
I wish there was an emergency blinker

25
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:16,040
for the bad luck that suddenly drops in.

26
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:20,170
I can't avoid the pain
that's about to rush in,

27
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:22,130
but I can prepare for it at least.

28
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,430
They said

29
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,220
his name would give him a short life.

30
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:34,350
I thought nothing of it.

31
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:37,400
Why did I do that?

32
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:42,690
If only I changed his name...

33
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,030
I feel like

34
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,080
it's my fault.

35
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:55,000
Everyday I want to turn back time

36
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:59,130
to that day tens of thousands of times.

37
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,880
If only I stopped her

38
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,470
from going to work

39
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:10,720
just for five minutes.

40
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:12,220
No,

41
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,060
just for one more minute,

42
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:20,110
then she'd still be here.

43
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:25,700
Why didn't I stop her?

44
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,460
But even if there is a blinker,

45
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:44,510
bad luck will never turn it on
so we can notice it.

46
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:47,090
She died because of me.

47
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,760
I killed her.

48
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:55,230
I did.

49
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,310
I killed her.

50
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:05,150
Bring Yu-ri back.

51
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:07,780
Bring her back.

52
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,740
Bring her back, you jerk.

53
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:14,160
Bring Yu-ri back.

54
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,210
So you don't have to blame yourself

55
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,540
for not seeing it.

56
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:24,960
EPISODE 14: IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT

57
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:28,470
Min-jeong.

58
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,350
Why are you crying? Don't cry.

59
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:35,100
It's not your fault. Okay?

60
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,520
Then whose fault is it?

61
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:44,440
Is it because you're at the hospital
all day long?

62
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:51,320
I hired a pick-up helper
to return to work, then lost my child.

63
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:55,080
And Seo-woo

64
00:04:57,450 --> 00:05:01,170
is slower and grayer than most children.

65
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:05,300
If all of those aren't my fault,
whose fault is it?

66
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:08,550
Am I not her mother?

67
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:10,090
Min-jeong.

68
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:15,560
When something is wrong with a kid,
everyone blames the mother.

69
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,730
Why do you always say it's not my fault?

70
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,480
You said I'm Seo-woo's mother.

71
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:27,400
Am I really her mother?

72
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,280
I'm sorry.

73
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:36,950
I'm sorry.

74
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,580
Why are you always

75
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:45,630
sorry

76
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,300
and fine?

77
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:13,320
Cha Yu-ri.

78
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:19,790
Those three syllables
are taboo words to me.

79
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,790
How long

80
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,090
will you keep that door shut to me?

81
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:31,050
How long will you
keep that door locked up?

82
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,760
You have to open that door
for me to go in.

83
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:41,350
That's the only way
I can truly be Seo-woo's mom.

84
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:06,870
The pick-up helper.

85
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,800
That's her.

86
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,800
Yu-ri.

87
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,510
Cha Yu-ri.

88
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:34,900
What

89
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:37,950
do you...

90
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,780
What do you mean?

91
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,580
Seo-woo's biological mother.

92
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:52,500
Cha Yu-ri.

93
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:57,970
She came back to life.

94
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:09,770
I'm sorry, but could you please leave?

95
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:12,940
I really don't want to see you right now.

96
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,070
How... How can you lose her? How?

97
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:49,540
Seo-woo, you're up.

98
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,090
Seo-woo, good morning.
Shall we wash your face?

99
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:01,220
Min-jeong.

100
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,860
All done.

101
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:28,950
Okay.

102
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:42,380
Stay here for a minute.

103
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,370
Won't you get ready for work? You're late.

104
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,950
I know you can't believe it.

105
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,170
Because I couldn't either.

106
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:21,550
No, I don't believe it.

107
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,380
It doesn't make sense.

108
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,800
Does this make sense to you?

109
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:28,840
The kitchen assistant.

110
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:32,180
The pick-up helper is Seo-woo's mom?

111
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,930
She came back to life?

112
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:36,390
Stop joking around.

113
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,310
Why would I make a joke like this?

114
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:42,860
Exactly. Why would someone
joke around like this?

115
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:47,950
This is the worst you've ever been.

116
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:52,620
It's unbelievable,

117
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,000
but it's true.

118
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,210
I don't believe it.

119
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:02,460
Then why did you cry so much last night?

120
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:09,340
Fine.

121
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,260
Let's say what you're saying is true.

122
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,270
Then

123
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:20,650
why did you tell me this

124
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,480
now?

125
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,070
I'm sorry.

126
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:36,410
At first, I was flustered,

127
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,040
so I couldn't tell you.

128
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,710
But you can't be the only one
who doesn't know.

129
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:46,300
Min-jeong.

130
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,470
Believe it or not,

131
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:52,140
it's true.

132
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:00,520
MISAENG

133
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,780
-Excuse me.
-Gosh.

134
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,030
What's up with him?

135
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:12,740
Why are you following me?

136
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:15,410
Can you see me?

137
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:17,410
Do you see ghosts, too?

138
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,620
Can you see me?

139
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:22,330
Are you on my left or right?

140
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
-Where are you?
-Gosh.

141
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:26,050
Darn.

142
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:30,010
No, I'm a Christian.

143
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:32,890
I don't believe in ghosts.

144
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:35,970
I think I believe it a little.

145
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,640
I did.

146
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,480
It's because I go to fortunetellers.

147
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:42,060
Why did Yu-ri tell me that?

148
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:44,770
Gosh, he's no fun.

149
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,780
Hyeon-jeong.

150
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:55,530
Hyeon-jeong.

151
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,290
Hyeon-jeong!

152
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:02,460
Yes. What?

153
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:04,920
How spicy do you want that to be?

154
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,750
Goodness.

155
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:10,340
-What is it this time?
-Oh, gosh.

156
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:12,590
Is it because of Yu-ri?

157
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:20,220
Why are you sighing
while talking about Yu-ri?

158
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:21,390
What?

159
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:24,690
You're the one who always sighs
because of her.

160
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:29,020
I'm just worried about her,
and I feel bad for her.

161
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:30,900
That's all.

162
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,240
Yu-ri is Seo-woo's mom,

163
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:36,370
so I want to help her,
but it's complicated.

164
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:39,410
That's why I keep sighing.

165
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:42,040
Gang-hwa and you feel the same way, too.

166
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,670
I understand

167
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:47,960
why Yu-ri hid from us

168
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,710
instead of coming to us first.

169
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:54,090
Why?

170
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:56,640
Everyone is having a hard time
because I came back.

171
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,220
Because of me, Gang-hwa and you
are such in pain.

172
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:02,850
I shouldn't have gotten caught.

173
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:07,100
What is it?

174
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:08,610
Hey.

175
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:13,820
-Watch the shop for me.
-Why?

176
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:15,200
Where are you going?

177
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,860
Hyeon-jeong, don't go.

178
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:19,410
I can't look after the store alone
right now.

179
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:21,450
I'm in a state of great fear.

180
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,250
Hyeon-jeong!

181
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:27,880
Are you out of your mind?

182
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,670
How can you take your eyes off her?

183
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:32,960
She was right behind me.

184
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:35,840
It was just for a second.

185
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:37,430
A split second.

186
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:43,140
I knew something was strange last night.

187
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,480
Did Gang-hwa's wife say something?

188
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:48,940
Why wouldn't she
when the pick-up helper lost her kid?

189
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:54,030
Gosh, you idiot!

190
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:56,990
Idiot!

191
00:15:58,530 --> 00:16:00,570
-Gosh.
-Goodness.

192
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:06,750
OH MIN-JEONG
I'M SORRY

193
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:20,930
-Pil-seung's family?
-Yes.

194
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:23,640
Guk-bong was grilling them
to find out where Seo-woo was,

195
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,060
and they threw a fit not to tell him

196
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:28,520
I heard she was hiding in the playground.

197
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:30,810
Yes, in a slide.

198
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,520
They hid her well.

199
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,110
I guess they're pretty loyal.

200
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:38,530
They were taken away from there.

201
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:43,160
Where is Pil-seung's family now?

202
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:50,710
No way...

203
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:53,460
They're gone.

204
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,420
Come on. Don't mess with me.

205
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:01,220
They're a tenacious bunch.
They've been holding out for 20 years.

206
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:04,510
They're gone just like that

207
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:06,220
because of Seo-woo?

208
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:09,140
It's been 20 years,
so it's about time they left.

209
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:11,100
They held out a long time.

210
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:14,770
I don't believe it.

211
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:18,860
Well...

212
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:21,110
They were taken

213
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:22,990
because they were hiding Seo-woo?

214
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:24,780
It's okay.

215
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,830
They made the choice.

216
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:29,250
They understand how a mother feels.

217
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:34,500
You'll be up there soon.

218
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,590
Thank them when you get there.

219
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:45,350
I should cook for Pil-seung one more time.

220
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:48,180
Like you got enough time.

221
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:50,770
Don't worry about others.

222
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:52,850
Enjoy what you can while you're here.

223
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:54,560
You idiot.

224
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:02,200
I can't believe
what Pil-seung's family did.

225
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:04,160
I'm so grateful.

226
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:09,620
But I can't thank them
because they're gone.

227
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:13,790
-Yu-ri.
-Yes, Mom?

228
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,210
Come out. Hyeon-jeong is here.

229
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,630
Really?

230
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:20,300
What is it?

231
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:21,840
Hyeon-jeong is here.

232
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,380
Okay.

233
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,480
Hey.

234
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,310
What is this?

235
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:39,940
Hey, hop in.

236
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:42,950
Hyeon-jeong.

237
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,200
What's all this? Where did you get it?

238
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,570
Why do you even ask? I'm a hip like this.

239
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:48,830
Get in.

240
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:51,450
-Is it really okay?
-Sure.

241
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,370
Yeon-ji. Bring your sister's bag.

242
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:57,750
My gosh.

243
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:02,920
What are you waiting for? Hop in.

244
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:16,150
All right then. Shall we go?

245
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:17,440
Where are we going?

246
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:19,270
Anywhere.

247
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:21,110
We can go anywhere you want.

248
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:27,200
Now she smiles.

249
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:30,870
Gosh, I can tell they are soul mates.

250
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,830
Mom, I think Hyeon-jeong
is the best. Right?

251
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:56,310
-Yu-ri, do you like it?
-I love it.

252
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,980
It feels so refreshing!

253
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:01,270
I like it too!

254
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,770
All right. Let's go.

255
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:03,980
One.

256
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:06,070
Two. Three!

257
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,780
This is amazing.

258
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:16,210
It must be fun.

259
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:18,040
-Yu-ri.
-Yes?

260
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,960
Are you all right?
Do you want to go back down now?

261
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:21,880
I'm fine.

262
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:24,170
You don't seem fine though.

263
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:25,550
I'm okay.

264
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,130
-Of course, I am.
-Hyeon-jeong.

265
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,680
Gosh, no. This isn't right.

266
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,430
No!

267
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,020
Yu-ri.

268
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,940
Hyeon-jeong.

269
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,090
I love the scenery.

270
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:19,180
Hyeon-jeong, hurry.

271
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:58,470
Is this for me?

272
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,040
DON'T JOKE AROUND LIKE THAT AGAIN

273
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:39,970
OPERATION SCHEDULE

274
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,810
My operation is tomorrow.

275
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:45,020
I said I don't want to do this.

276
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:47,020
-Why not?
-Just because.

277
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:49,150
I'm not doing it.

278
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:50,820
Why?

279
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:53,200
Why do you not want to do this?

280
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,070
You've been doing well
with the counseling.

281
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,910
You need to face this to get better.

282
00:22:56,990 --> 00:23:00,120
Will you keep living as a doctor
who can't operate?

283
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:03,960
Maybe later.

284
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,790
I'll do it some other time.

285
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:07,130
When would it be?

286
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:10,050
It's about time
to stop torturing yourself.

287
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,260
-Here.
-Thanks.

288
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:24,890
Now you look like Cha Yu-ri.

289
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:29,020
Yu-ri.

290
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:30,480
Yes?

291
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:32,280
For the past five years,

292
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:37,360
were you around me as well?

293
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:41,910
Sure. I stuck around you all the time.

294
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:47,330
Even I forgot my birthday,
but you remembered it every year.

295
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,840
Maybe I was struggling not to forget you.

296
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:55,220
I guess that's why.

297
00:23:56,930 --> 00:23:58,050
After you left,

298
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:00,850
it didn't really hit me at first.

299
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:03,310
When I studied abroad,

300
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:05,810
we didn't see each other for about a year.

301
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:07,940
It was like that.

302
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,690
I felt like you were just away
for a little bit.

303
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:19,070
And once I realized that I would
never be able to see you again,

304
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:22,330
I couldn't even eat.

305
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,660
I just cried my eyes out.

306
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:28,670
But after a little while,

307
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:31,420
I felt hungry again.

308
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,010
So I started to eat,

309
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:36,970
take care of Ha-jun,

310
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:38,180
and work.

311
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:43,430
And one day,

312
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:47,810
I realized that

313
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,400
I was forgetting about you.

314
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:54,690
I just celebrated your birthdays

315
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:57,570
because I wanted to cling on to you.

316
00:24:58,610 --> 00:25:00,320
Because I was sorry for you.

317
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:04,870
And you knew it, right?

318
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:06,910
Of course, I did.

319
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:10,290
Actually I was sad
that you were forgetting about me.

320
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:13,540
But

321
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:19,090
I was afraid if I wouldn't be forgotten.

322
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:25,260
Watching people
have hard times because of me,

323
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:28,100
was real hell.

324
00:25:29,810 --> 00:25:30,640
Gang-hwa?

325
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:36,780
So you knew it too.

326
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:39,320
That Gang-hwa has a problem.

327
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,740
I do. I was around him all the time.

328
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,330
He recently received a probation.

329
00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:48,080
I found out about it later on though.

330
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:53,710
That's what I did to him.

331
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,210
I broke his heart.

332
00:25:56,290 --> 00:25:58,090
It's not your fault.

333
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:00,510
Isn't it like you died
because you wanted to.

334
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:03,890
But it was my choice.

335
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:08,850
I just made him feel guilty.

336
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:31,410
Where did she go leaving me alone?

337
00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:35,330
Oh, right.

338
00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:37,920
That's right.

339
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,260

SEO BONG-YEON

341
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:05,320
I know you're a stone-hearted human,

342
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:10,240
but how could you send them up
just like that?

343
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:11,790
My point.

344
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,290
I didn't even get to say goodbye. Damn it.

345
00:27:20,050 --> 00:27:21,590
You guys are not human.

346
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:24,880
To Guk-bong...

347
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:27,180
I mean, to people,

348
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:29,800
you guys are just demons
who should be sent up.

349
00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:31,600
How could you say something so harsh?

350
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,890
I know.

351
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:35,890
So if you don't want to get caught
and sent up all of a sudden like them,

352
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:37,850
stop avoiding Guk-bong

353
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:42,360
and get over your regrets in this world.

354
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:47,360
This is really frustrating.

355
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,160
Hello?

356
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:57,540
Hello, ma'am.

357
00:27:58,210 --> 00:27:59,790
Do you make domiciliary visits?

358
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:01,130
What?

359
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:09,720
Min-jeong. Believe it or not,

360
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:11,600
it's true.

361
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,450
What are you doing?

362
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:32,580
Get off, Yu-ri.

363
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,830
You said we'd hang out at my place.

364
00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:38,920
We will drink. So I can't drive.

365
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Let's walk.

366
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:46,300
I'm hungry. Let's go.

367
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:01,600
-I'm so hungry.
-Me too.

368
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:03,690
-I shouted too much.
-I know.

369
00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:06,740
I couldn't help it
because you drove so fast.

370
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:18,580
-Is it here?
-Yes.

371
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:19,660
It's for us.

372
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:21,620
-It just came right on time.
-I know.

373
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:23,710
-Please enjoy.
-Thank you.

374
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:25,300
It's pork belly meat.

375
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:27,800
-Let's go.
-Mom, Yu-ri and Hyeon-jeong are here.

376
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:30,050
Gosh, I can't wait.

377
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:33,640
-Let's eat.
-It must be really good.

378
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:36,430
Hello, Ms. Jeon.

379
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:49,280
CHA MU-PUNG, JEON EUN-SUK,
CHA YU-RI, CHA YEON-JI

380
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,150
-It looks delicious.
-It's warm.

381
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:30,240
My goodness.

382
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:32,400
-I'm hungry.
-It looks great.

383
00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:35,370
Here's a cold beer for you.

384
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:37,200
Yeon-ji, you're the best.

385
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,740
We have five drinkers here.

386
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:40,660
This is far from enough.

387
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:42,540
I don't drink beer.

388
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:43,580
I like soju.

389
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:47,040
I knew it. You're so my type.

390
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,800
Mom, I'll get you soju.

391
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,170
Here, Dad.

392
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:52,590
-My daughter is the best.
-Gosh.

393
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:53,720
It's good, isn't it?

394
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:57,350
-This is nice.
-Dad, please open this for me.

395
00:30:57,430 --> 00:30:58,810
Give me that.

396
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:00,350
All right.

397
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:03,520
It's open.

398
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:06,400
It flew away like this.

399
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:08,400
Let's drink.

400
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,480
Here. Have some of this.

401
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:12,280
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

402
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,240
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

403
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,740
It tastes so good.

404
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:25,920
So we're all together with Hyeon-jeong.

405
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,790
It's been so long since we did this.

406
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,040
I know.

407
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:31,960
I've been too busy
working and raising my kid.

408
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:34,840
She was just afraid
she would remind us of Yu-ri,

409
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,890
so she was being thoughtful.

410
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,350
Do you think I don't know that?

411
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:43,060
I had no idea

412
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:46,770
this day would come again.

413
00:31:46,850 --> 00:31:49,110
What are you doing, Dad? This isn't right.

414
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:52,480
She's right. Why are you being so silly?

415
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:53,860
Okay. I get it.

416
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:55,780
-I'm done. It's over.
-It's over.

417
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:58,950
-Mr. Cha, please stop.
-What's over?

418
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:01,870
It's nothing.
Your dad is just being silly again.

419
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:03,910
Do you say things like that?

420
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,080
Sure.

421
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,290
She says all kinds of stuff.

422
00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:08,420
-Gosh, Dad.
-Stop it.

423
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:12,130
-It tastes good.
-So

424
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:14,090
did you guys have fun?

425
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:15,420
Yes. We had a lot of fun.

426
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:18,800
Hyeon-jeong's driving has improved a lot.
She was too afraid to run at 50km before.

427
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:20,180
Hey, that was a long time ago.

428
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:24,180
That's not true.
I was a novice driver back then.

429
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:26,600
Still, 50km is too slow.

430
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:29,480
Here, Yu-ri. Try this.

431
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,810
You seem to have only one daughter.

432
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:34,150
You're my son. All right.

433
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:36,990
I didn't know I was a son.

434
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:40,780
All right. I should give this to my son.

435
00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:43,120
Here. Good.

436
00:32:43,410 --> 00:32:44,950
Why don't we take a picture together?

437
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,660
-Good.
-Let's do that.

438
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:48,160
Do I look okay?

439
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:50,000
-You look perfect.
-You look beautiful.

440
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,830
-Don't worry.
-You're always pretty.

441
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:52,840
I'll put this on here.

442
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:55,130
Gather together and look at the camera.

443
00:32:55,210 --> 00:32:56,510
Mr. Cha, come closer.

444
00:32:56,590 --> 00:32:58,130
One...

445
00:32:58,470 --> 00:32:59,800
Come closer to each other.

446
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:02,470
-One...
-Is it how it works?

447
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,850
Let me see the picture.

448
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:07,930
I'll show you.

449
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:10,560
I'm very grateful to Hyeon-jeong.

450
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:14,230
I'm always grateful to her.

451
00:35:14,730 --> 00:35:16,190
Did you like it, Yu-ri?

452
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:18,520
Yes. I loved it.

453
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:22,070
What was so good?

454
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,030
I liked the wind,

455
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:27,570
I liked the air,

456
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:29,580
and I liked Hyeon-jeong next to me.

457
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:32,330
I'm glad to hear that.

458
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,210
Things will be always like that
from now on.

459
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:40,290
We will have happy moments
like that every day, Yu-ri.

460
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:46,180
Do you not want it?

461
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:48,550
Of course, I want it.

462
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:53,020
What?

463
00:35:54,890 --> 00:35:56,100
Dad.

464
00:35:56,810 --> 00:35:57,770
Is Dad sleeping already?

465
00:35:58,770 --> 00:36:02,400
Dad, you can't sleep here.

466
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:05,740
-My gosh.
-It's been less than a minute.

467
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,990
It was somewhere around here. Where is it?

468
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:11,830
There it is. It says Misaeng.

469
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:17,040
What is he doing here?

470
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:21,420
Hey.

471
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:25,670
Gosh, it hurts.

472
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,300
-It hurts.
-What are you doing here?

473
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:28,930
Gosh, it's not like that.

474
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:30,140
Let go of me.

475
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:31,930
-It really hurts.
-Come here.

476
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:37,230
Come here. I got you.

477
00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:39,940
-Just follow me.
-It hurts.

478
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:41,270
Hello.

479
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:44,440
Stay still. Stop.

480
00:36:44,530 --> 00:36:46,940
What's with your arms?

481
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:49,280
Is something there?

482
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:51,660
What have you been up to these days?

483
00:36:51,950 --> 00:36:53,620
Why is there a ghost around you?

484
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:55,330
What? A ghost?

485
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:56,830
-Stay still.
-Ghost?

486
00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:58,750
I told you to stand still!

487
00:36:58,830 --> 00:36:59,960
Isn't it staying still?

488
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:02,750
-It hurts.
-Stop it. Stay still.

489
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:12,050
Is he always so stupid like that?

490
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:15,310
Because she's not here.

491
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:16,970
Who?

492
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:18,270
His wife.

493
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,600
He's Hyeon-jeong's boy.

494
00:37:19,690 --> 00:37:21,690
Hyeon-jeong. Where are you?

495
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:26,110
Hurry and come right away, Hyeon-jeong.

496
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:30,610
Gosh, you now know Yu-ri was around you
for five years.

497
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:32,240
Just come over here.

498
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:35,870
I didn't know about it.

499
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:37,870
Are you sure

500
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:39,870
there's a ghost next to you?

501
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:43,330
Why? Why is it doing this to me?

502
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:45,840
Is it because I refused
to write a fake diagnosis?

503
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,510
Gosh, it's no big deal.

504
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:53,680
"Gosh, it's no big deal."

505
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:56,470
Then why?

506
00:37:57,390 --> 00:37:58,850
Why are you hanging around with him?

507
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,850
Right. That one.

508
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:02,060
There's something

509
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,150
only he can do for me.

510
00:38:07,730 --> 00:38:08,940
What?

511
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:12,700
What is it?

512
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:15,570
Ms. Mi-dong, please tell me what he says.

513
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:17,080
Why? Why is he doing this to me?

514
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:20,660
So there's something
only you can do for him.

515
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,250
What is it?

516
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:29,170
Please tell my mom

517
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:30,970
that I didn't

518
00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:34,090
kill myself.

519
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:41,850
He knows that it wasn't a suicide.

520
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:45,270
What does he say?

521
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,820
What is it? What?

522
00:38:48,690 --> 00:38:50,900
Ms. Mi-dong, please.
I need a simultaneous interpretation.

523
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,900
I can't wait.

524
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,570
I'm very anxious.

525
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:27,150
It must've been fun

526
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:35,820
to see how much I loved her
like some kind of an idiot.

527
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:45,120
No, it wasn't like that.

528
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:49,540
Do you know what I said?

529
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:54,880
I said I'm curious about her
because she looks like Seo-woo's mom.

530
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,140
That I'm envious

531
00:39:59,350 --> 00:40:00,970
because she looks like Seo-woo.

532
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:04,640
I had no idea.

533
00:40:06,770 --> 00:40:08,150
I was like a fool.

534
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,370
You should've told me first.

535
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:31,090
That's what you should've done.

536
00:40:41,390 --> 00:40:43,600
It has been a while

537
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:47,850
since you looked so happy

538
00:40:50,270 --> 00:40:52,820
when you were around other people.

539
00:40:56,110 --> 00:40:57,320
I was afraid

540
00:40:59,570 --> 00:41:00,950
you would get hurt.

541
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:10,620
I'm sorry.

542
00:41:21,970 --> 00:41:23,850
Before caring about my happiness,

543
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,730
you should care about yours.

544
00:41:29,890 --> 00:41:31,730
Before seeing my wound,

545
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:34,230
you should take care of yours first.

546
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,150
You're a mess.

547
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:53,750
Why do you keep
torturing yourself like that?

548
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:24,740
-Is everything going well for lunch?
-Yes.

549
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:27,030
Director.

550
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:30,500
Is Seo-woo here yet?

551
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:33,710
She's supposed to be here by now,
but I haven't seen her yet.

552
00:42:33,790 --> 00:42:36,250
Seo-woo is not coming today.

553
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:38,630
Why not? Is she sick?

554
00:42:38,710 --> 00:42:40,010
No.

555
00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:42,930
She will stay home with her mom today.

556
00:42:43,970 --> 00:42:45,220
I see.

557
00:42:45,970 --> 00:42:46,890
Okay.

558
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:59,230
I'M SORRY

559
00:43:07,370 --> 00:43:08,660
CONTACTS

560
00:43:10,410 --> 00:43:12,620
CHO GANG-HWA

561
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:49,280
Why do you always say
everything is all right?

562
00:43:49,410 --> 00:43:52,200
It's not all right at all.
You aren't all right.

563
00:43:52,290 --> 00:43:53,790
Why are you always

564
00:43:55,370 --> 00:43:58,290
sorry and fine?

565
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:08,510
Before seeing my wound,

566
00:44:09,090 --> 00:44:11,140
you should take care of yours first.

567
00:44:12,930 --> 00:44:14,850
You're a mess.

568
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:35,910
OPERATION SCHEDULE

569
00:44:51,930 --> 00:44:53,600
So he's not doing this?

570
00:44:54,970 --> 00:44:57,100
He's getting counseling.

571
00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:59,400
But why isn't he doing this?

572
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:02,980
He should go to the place
where he got traumatized.

573
00:45:03,070 --> 00:45:06,860
I guess he's afraid to bring up things
that he's been avoiding and correct them.

574
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:15,290
What was it? The exposure therapy?

575
00:45:15,490 --> 00:45:16,370
I'll do it.

576
00:45:16,950 --> 00:45:18,040
OPERATION SCHEDULE

577
00:45:19,210 --> 00:45:20,170
Why?

578
00:45:24,290 --> 00:45:25,630
You said you wouldn't do it.

579
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:27,670
What made you change your mind?

580
00:45:28,510 --> 00:45:30,470
I can't keep living like this.

581
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:33,390
Do I need to just observe the operation?

582
00:45:33,470 --> 00:45:34,680
For now.

583
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:37,310
The goal is to gradually expose you
to the place you're afraid of

584
00:45:37,390 --> 00:45:38,640
so you get used to it.

585
00:45:39,230 --> 00:45:40,060
Okay.

586
00:45:44,610 --> 00:45:46,940
I think Doctor Cho will get better.

587
00:45:47,230 --> 00:45:48,690
What he said is a good sign.

588
00:45:48,990 --> 00:45:51,110
He said, "I can't keep living like this."

589
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:53,240
Not "just because."

590
00:45:58,870 --> 00:46:01,580
Of course, she's angry at me.
I lost her kid.

591
00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:06,090
Still, I don't have much time left.

592
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:08,840
I really need to see Seo-woo.

593
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:14,180
Should I go beg for forgiveness?

594
00:46:22,270 --> 00:46:23,400
Mom!

595
00:46:26,610 --> 00:46:27,690
Hey.

596
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:29,490
Where are you going?

597
00:46:29,570 --> 00:46:31,400
I have a doctor's appointment.

598
00:46:31,490 --> 00:46:32,490
I'm going to the hospital.

599
00:46:32,570 --> 00:46:34,240
Right, it's Monday today.

600
00:46:34,870 --> 00:46:36,160
How did you know that?

601
00:46:36,990 --> 00:46:39,160
Well, Yeon-ji told me.

602
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:40,620
Can I come with you?

603
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:42,120
-You want to?
-Yes.

604
00:47:22,370 --> 00:47:25,920
Your heart starts racing
whenever you see a crosswalk.

605
00:47:57,030 --> 00:47:58,870
I thought I was getting by,

606
00:48:00,620 --> 00:48:04,000
but seeing a crosswalk would always
get my heart racing.

607
00:48:04,710 --> 00:48:07,000
I didn't try to remember it or anything,

608
00:48:08,130 --> 00:48:09,840
but my body must have remembered it.

609
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:12,460
I'm okay now.

610
00:48:13,050 --> 00:48:16,050
Wouldn't it be strange
if I didn't change at all

611
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:17,800
after what happened?

612
00:48:18,430 --> 00:48:19,800
I'm only human after all.

613
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:35,360
What's with him now?

614
00:48:38,410 --> 00:48:39,490
Doctor Gye.

615
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:40,990
Gosh, you startled me.

616
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:44,370
What is it? What do you need?

617
00:48:44,450 --> 00:48:46,540
Why are you not in your office?

618
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:52,040
There are people here.

619
00:48:52,130 --> 00:48:53,380
Pardon?

620
00:48:57,670 --> 00:48:59,760
Well, you know...

621
00:49:01,010 --> 00:49:03,140
Someone asked me a favor,

622
00:49:03,850 --> 00:49:06,270
but I'm not sure if I should say yes.

623
00:49:06,350 --> 00:49:08,810
Say yes if it isn't something
extremely difficult.

624
00:49:08,890 --> 00:49:11,270
It's not like a dead person asked you
a favor, so why not?

625
00:49:11,690 --> 00:49:13,320
-A dead person asked me a favor.
-Pardon?

626
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:15,820
Nothing. Never mind.

627
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:17,740
It's nothing.

628
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:20,700
Shouldn't you go check on Doctor Cho?

629
00:49:20,780 --> 00:49:23,120
Cho Gang-hwa? Why? Should I?

630
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:26,080
He's attending Doctor Jang's surgery
today. Everyone's been fussing.

631
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:27,200
What?

632
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:40,510
Gang-hwa, you're attending surgery?

633
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:42,010
Exposure therapy?

634
00:49:42,220 --> 00:49:43,260
Yes.

635
00:49:43,430 --> 00:49:45,390
Will you be all right?
I don't think you're ready.

636
00:49:46,350 --> 00:49:47,680
It can't be that bad.

637
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:49,810
If you start hyperventilating,

638
00:49:50,190 --> 00:49:51,730
remember to take deep breaths.

639
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:53,940
Get out as soon as it starts
getting bad, okay?

640
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:32,560
RESTRICTED AREA

641
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:10,020
Mom, why did you stop going to Gang-hwa?

642
00:51:10,270 --> 00:51:12,350
He knows your heart
better than any other doctor.

643
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:14,440
My condition is nothing serious.

644
00:51:15,190 --> 00:51:17,810
What's the point of seeing him regularly

645
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:20,730
and reminding him of his pain?

646
00:51:21,940 --> 00:51:24,950
I thought it'd be best
to stop seeing him altogether.

647
00:51:28,070 --> 00:51:29,450
Ms. Jeon Eun-suk.

648
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:32,160
-I'll be right back. Stay here.
-Okay.

649
00:51:40,340 --> 00:51:41,420
What happened?

650
00:51:41,510 --> 00:51:43,800
I heard Doctor Cho attended surgery today.

651
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:46,890
-Again?
-Only ten minutes in,

652
00:51:46,970 --> 00:51:48,800
his symptoms appeared, and he rushed out.

653
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:50,350
My gosh.

654
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:01,360
Gang-hwa.

655
00:52:01,780 --> 00:52:02,860
Where is he?

656
00:52:02,940 --> 00:52:04,740
I'm not sure. He rushed out.

657
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:06,200
I don't know where he went.

658
00:52:06,450 --> 00:52:08,700
How was he? Did he handle it okay?

659
00:52:08,780 --> 00:52:09,870
No.

660
00:52:12,540 --> 00:52:14,040
-Go look for him.
-Okay.

661
00:52:37,350 --> 00:52:38,560
Have you seen Doctor Cho?

662
00:52:38,650 --> 00:52:39,980
-No.
-Gosh.

663
00:53:26,740 --> 00:53:29,070
Gang-hwa, look at me.

664
00:53:33,620 --> 00:53:34,910
Breathe.

665
00:53:35,490 --> 00:53:36,750
It's okay.

666
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:38,160
It's okay.

667
00:53:38,540 --> 00:53:41,370
It's okay. Breathe slowly.

668
00:53:52,550 --> 00:53:54,300
It's okay.

669
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:55,510
Everything's okay.

670
00:54:54,610 --> 00:54:56,370
Breathe, okay?

671
00:55:05,250 --> 00:55:06,840
Breathe.

672
00:55:10,630 --> 00:55:11,670
Breathe.

673
00:55:24,690 --> 00:55:26,810
Gang-hwa, are you okay?

674
00:55:27,730 --> 00:55:29,070
Breathe.

675
00:55:41,490 --> 00:55:43,000
Go ahead and breathe.

676
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:50,250
Why did you do that?

677
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:55,630
Why did you do that?

678
00:55:57,340 --> 00:56:00,100
Why? Why did you leave me all alone?

679
00:56:05,190 --> 00:56:06,520
Why did you?

680
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:09,980
Why did you do that?

681
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:14,030
Why?

682
00:56:15,030 --> 00:56:17,860
We have to operate on him first.
Otherwise, he's going to die!

683
00:56:17,950 --> 00:56:20,370
I said, no! Transfer him.

684
00:56:20,450 --> 00:56:22,200
I'm ready! Why can't I operate on him?

685
00:56:22,290 --> 00:56:23,160
I can save him!

686
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:24,910
The other patient is a VIP!

687
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:27,040
Do as you're told.

688
00:56:27,170 --> 00:56:29,330
I can't cover for you anymore.

689
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:32,210
Go to the other operating room.

690
00:56:35,130 --> 00:56:36,300
I can't.

691
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:41,510
Get him.

692
00:56:42,390 --> 00:56:44,470
-Get him!
-Yes, Doctor.

693
00:56:50,020 --> 00:56:51,020
Lock the door.

694
00:56:51,110 --> 00:56:52,020
Pardon?

695
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:54,650
I said, lock the door.

696
00:56:54,860 --> 00:56:56,320
Well. Okay.

697
00:56:56,820 --> 00:56:58,910
-Intercoms off.
-Okay.

698
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:04,580
Don't open the door or answer your phone
until the surgery is over.

699
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:10,460
The door is locked.

700
00:57:10,540 --> 00:57:12,460
That punk.

701
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:18,510
Doctor Jang,
a pregnant traffic accident patient.

702
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:20,140
Please come with us.

703
00:57:36,030 --> 00:57:37,190
Call Gang-hwa.

704
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:38,280
Pardon?

705
00:57:38,490 --> 00:57:40,320
I said, call Gang-hwa! Right now!

706
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,880
Where's Gang-hwa? You couldn't reach him?

707
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:55,340
No.

708
00:57:55,710 --> 00:57:58,880
If we wait any longer,
we'll lose both mother and child.

709
00:58:09,310 --> 00:58:10,440
Doctor.

710
00:58:11,350 --> 00:58:12,560
My baby...

711
00:58:13,190 --> 00:58:15,570
Please save my baby first.

712
00:58:16,610 --> 00:58:17,900
My baby...

713
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:21,450
Please save her.

714
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:23,990
Please save her first.

715
00:58:26,030 --> 00:58:27,990
-Doctor Cho.
-Yes?

716
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:29,250
Your wife

717
00:58:30,870 --> 00:58:32,120
had an accident.

718
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:06,030
Yu-ri, wake up.

719
00:59:07,490 --> 00:59:08,370
Yu-ri!

720
00:59:15,790 --> 00:59:16,920
Why did you do that?

721
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:19,380
Why?

722
00:59:57,130 --> 00:59:58,880
You should have lived.

723
01:00:01,670 --> 01:00:02,800
You should have...

724
01:00:05,340 --> 01:00:07,010
You should have lived.

725
01:00:08,220 --> 01:00:10,430
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

726
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:12,270
I'm sorry for everything.

727
01:00:15,140 --> 01:00:16,690
Stop blaming yourself.

728
01:00:17,350 --> 01:00:18,560
It's not your fault.

729
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:33,120
Resentment, guilt, and regret...

730
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:34,580
All those emotions are entangled.

731
01:00:35,580 --> 01:00:37,420
But mostly, he'd feel guilty.

732
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:40,340
He'd think things would've been different

733
01:00:41,090 --> 01:00:43,090
if he hadn't been in surgery that day.

734
01:00:44,260 --> 01:00:45,970
So he blames himself?

735
01:00:46,590 --> 01:00:47,590
Yes.

736
01:00:48,010 --> 01:00:50,720
And the person who caused
all these emotions is gone.

737
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:52,010
She died.

738
01:00:52,310 --> 01:00:55,060
So he had to bottle everything up
and got sick as a result.

739
01:01:10,780 --> 01:01:12,950
PICK-UP HELPER DO-YEON
I'M SORRY.

740
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:19,310
You'll damage your stomach.
Have some food too.

741
01:02:26,820 --> 01:02:28,570
It's a start.

742
01:02:28,650 --> 01:02:30,490
Ten minutes is impressive.

743
01:02:30,570 --> 01:02:32,410
It'll only get better.

744
01:02:36,030 --> 01:02:37,410
Where were you?

745
01:02:37,490 --> 01:02:39,330
They couldn't find you anywhere.

746
01:02:39,410 --> 01:02:40,290
Well...

747
01:02:40,830 --> 01:02:42,170
I was where I always go.

748
01:02:44,290 --> 01:02:46,540
So what made you
want to receive treatment?

749
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:56,470
She wants me to let her go.

750
01:02:57,810 --> 01:02:58,850
And I think

751
01:02:59,970 --> 01:03:01,520
it might be time

752
01:03:02,440 --> 01:03:03,600
to let her go

753
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:06,770
since she came back to life.

754
01:03:08,070 --> 01:03:09,400
What are you talking about?

755
01:03:13,110 --> 01:03:14,700
Can't you try to keep

756
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:18,490
only the good memories
and forget the sad ones?

757
01:03:22,790 --> 01:03:24,750
Only the good memories...

758
01:03:25,330 --> 01:03:27,080
Only the happy memories...

759
01:03:28,210 --> 01:03:30,210
If I kept only those,

760
01:03:31,130 --> 01:03:33,170
I wouldn't be here right now.

761
01:03:33,380 --> 01:03:34,510
Why not?

762
01:03:40,100 --> 01:03:41,430
I'd miss her too much.

763
01:03:46,650 --> 01:03:48,230
I'd miss her too much.

764
01:03:49,270 --> 01:03:50,940
When I missed her like crazy,

765
01:03:53,820 --> 01:03:55,820
she wouldn't even show up in my dreams.

766
01:04:29,190 --> 01:04:30,270
Yu-ri?

767
01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:31,360
Yes.

768
01:04:33,230 --> 01:04:35,650
I went there as soon as I heard
Gang-hwa rushed out in a panic,

769
01:04:36,150 --> 01:04:37,410
but Yu-ri was already there.

770
01:04:37,490 --> 01:04:39,280
How did she know where...

771
01:04:41,910 --> 01:04:44,750
-Oh...
-She watched him for five years.

772
01:04:44,830 --> 01:04:46,370
She saw how much he suffered too.

773
01:04:49,790 --> 01:04:50,840
That's right.

774
01:04:51,340 --> 01:04:52,670
How did she watch all that?

775
01:04:52,750 --> 01:04:53,920
I know.

776
01:04:55,130 --> 01:04:57,430
She was right there,
watching him suffer because of her.

777
01:04:58,180 --> 01:05:01,100
She cried, apologizing to him.
It was too painful to watch.

778
01:05:01,180 --> 01:05:02,720
Why would she apologize?

779
01:05:03,060 --> 01:05:04,520
She is the most unfortunate one.

780
01:05:36,300 --> 01:05:39,180
FAMILY AND HYEON-JEONG

781
01:06:18,670 --> 01:06:20,470
I want to live too.

782
01:06:36,110 --> 01:06:37,480
What are you doing?

783
01:06:39,650 --> 01:06:40,820
Do you know

784
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:43,860
what's more desperate

785
01:06:44,950 --> 01:06:46,740
than saying, "I want to die"?

786
01:06:47,540 --> 01:06:48,870
What is it?

787
01:06:51,710 --> 01:06:53,080
"I want to live."

788
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:56,790
What are you talking about,
all of a sudden?

789
01:06:57,630 --> 01:06:58,500
Yu-ri says

790
01:07:01,300 --> 01:07:02,630
she wants to live.

791
01:07:04,680 --> 01:07:07,560
Shouldn't she live if she wants to?

792
01:07:07,640 --> 01:07:10,020
I don't know what you're talking about.

793
01:07:10,430 --> 01:07:12,100
We were talking about Gang-hwa and Yu-ri.

794
01:07:13,230 --> 01:07:14,480
And Yu-ri is alive.

795
01:07:16,940 --> 01:07:17,820
Yu-ri...

796
01:07:23,900 --> 01:07:25,110
Yu-ri

797
01:07:27,410 --> 01:07:28,830
is going to die soon.

798
01:07:31,700 --> 01:07:33,370
She's going to die again soon.

799
01:07:36,380 --> 01:07:37,920
What are you talking about?

800
01:07:48,100 --> 01:07:49,430
What did you just say?

801
01:07:52,930 --> 01:07:54,190
Yu-ri is

802
01:07:56,900 --> 01:07:57,770
going to die?

803
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:12,450
Why is Yu-ri dying?

804
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:18,330
Why is Yu-ri dying again?

805
01:08:21,750 --> 01:08:23,840
What did you say?

806
01:08:24,920 --> 01:08:26,010
Can I

807
01:08:27,050 --> 01:08:28,260
live?

808
01:08:32,890 --> 01:08:34,180
I want to live.

809
01:08:34,480 --> 01:08:36,140
I want to live, Ms. Mi-dong.

810
01:08:37,350 --> 01:08:38,850
What did I do so wrong?

811
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:42,190
Is everything my fault?

812
01:08:43,690 --> 01:08:45,240
I wanted to live,

813
01:08:45,860 --> 01:08:46,860
and I still do.

814
01:08:48,950 --> 01:08:51,200
Seo-woo, Mom, Dad...

815
01:08:51,450 --> 01:08:53,540
I want to be with them for a long time.

816
01:09:02,920 --> 01:09:03,800
Yu-ri.

817
01:09:05,090 --> 01:09:05,920
Yes?

818
01:09:06,630 --> 01:09:08,010
In the past five years,

819
01:09:09,840 --> 01:09:11,890
when was the moment
you felt the most frustrated

820
01:09:13,010 --> 01:09:14,390
and wished you were alive?

821
01:09:22,690 --> 01:09:23,860
Right now.

822
01:09:26,280 --> 01:09:28,740
I've never wished for it
more than I do right now.

823
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:34,200
Can I

824
01:09:35,830 --> 01:09:37,000
live?

825
01:09:51,970 --> 01:09:53,510
VIP patients?

826
01:09:54,050 --> 01:09:55,430
They get surgery first?

827
01:09:56,220 --> 01:09:58,310
Yes, it's been going on

828
01:09:58,390 --> 01:10:00,350
secretly for years.

829
01:10:00,520 --> 01:10:02,980
Everyone knows it's wrong,
but no one has dared to speak up.

830
01:10:03,480 --> 01:10:06,530
And you're trying to change it now?

831
01:10:06,610 --> 01:10:09,530
Yes, he's going to submit a petition
signed by all the doctors.

832
01:10:09,610 --> 01:10:11,360
What if you get fired or something?

833
01:10:11,450 --> 01:10:13,410
Don't worry. That's never going to happen.

834
01:10:13,490 --> 01:10:15,160
I'm the best surgeon at our hospital.

835
01:10:15,740 --> 01:10:16,700
All right.

836
01:10:17,620 --> 01:10:19,910
Surgery should be performed
based on urgency.

837
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:23,170
Money shouldn't decide
who gets treated first.

838
01:10:23,250 --> 01:10:26,550
That's my husband. Isn't he amazing?

839
01:10:26,630 --> 01:10:27,960
He really is.

840
01:10:28,260 --> 01:10:30,090
My son-in-law is a real doctor.

841
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:32,380
You're the best.

842
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:35,970
DOCTOR CHO, THANK YOU SO MUCH

843
01:10:36,060 --> 01:10:38,470
WITHOUT YOUR HELP THAT DAY

844
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:41,140
MY HUSBAND WOULDN'T BE ALIVE TODAY

845
01:10:41,230 --> 01:10:43,900
THANK YOU AND THANK YOU

846
01:11:33,860 --> 01:11:34,990
Gang-hwa.

847
01:11:38,120 --> 01:11:38,990
I'm sorry.

848
01:11:39,450 --> 01:11:40,700
I'm sorry.

849
01:11:41,450 --> 01:11:42,660
I'm sorry.

850
01:11:44,620 --> 01:11:45,580
I'm sorry.

851
01:11:45,670 --> 01:11:48,000
It's not your fault, you idiot.

852
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:50,670
They said it was too late.

853
01:11:50,750 --> 01:11:52,840
Even if they'd reached you,

854
01:11:56,340 --> 01:11:58,890
it would've been too late to save Yu-ri.

855
01:12:04,390 --> 01:12:05,480
I'm sorry.

856
01:12:05,640 --> 01:12:08,650
This misfortune that struck you
out of the blue

857
01:12:10,070 --> 01:12:11,650
is not your fault.

858
01:12:13,940 --> 01:12:14,860
I'm sorry.

859
01:12:48,850 --> 01:12:50,860
