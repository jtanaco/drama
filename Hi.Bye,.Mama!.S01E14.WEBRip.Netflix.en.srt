1
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,250
What are you talking about?

2
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:53,420
You can't go.
Your due date is the day after tomorrow.

3
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,420
Goodness. It's okay, Mom.

4
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,130
It won't kill me.

5
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:59,550
I know it's work, but you're almost--

6
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:03,590
Okay. I'll finish it quickly,
and go straight home.

7
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:05,010
My goodness.

8
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,390
There's no stopping her.

9
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:11,940
Gosh, it's already a quarter to two.

10
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,020
Is Yu-ri going somewhere?

11
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:18,070
Someone who bought her work
asked her to fix something.

12
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:21,110
She's due soon,
she shouldn't be going around.

13
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,400
Why didn't you stop her?

14
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:24,030
You know she doesn't listen to me.

15
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:28,540
She said she'd be quick,
so she'll be fine.

16
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:32,660
So, what did you say you dreamed about?

17
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:34,670
I don't know. I don't remember.

18
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:37,290
I woke up this morning feeling weird.

19
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:39,090
I feel uneasy.

20
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:41,590
It probably means nothing
since you don't remember.

21
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:48,470
Goodness, it's all done.

22
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,440
Hello?

23
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,110
Yes, it is.

24
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:14,250
I wish there was an emergency blinker

25
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:17,040
for the bad luck that suddenly drops in.

26
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:21,170
I can't avoid the pain
that's about to rush in,

27
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:23,130
but I can prepare for it at least.

28
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,430
They said

29
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:30,220
his name would give him a short life.

30
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:35,350
I thought nothing of it.

31
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:38,400
Why did I do that?

32
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:43,690
If only I changed his name...

33
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,030
I feel like

34
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,080
it's my fault.

35
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:56,000
Everyday I want to turn back time

36
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:00,130
to that day tens of thousands of times.

37
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,880
If only I stopped her

38
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,470
from going to work

39
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:11,720
just for five minutes.

40
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:13,220
No,

41
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,060
just for one more minute,

42
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:21,110
then she'd still be here.

43
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:26,700
Why didn't I stop her?

44
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,460
But even if there is a blinker,

45
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:45,510
bad luck will never turn it on
so we can notice it.

46
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:48,090
She died because of me.

47
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,760
I killed her.

48
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:56,230
I did.

49
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,310
I killed her.

50
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:06,150
Bring Yu-ri back.

51
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:08,780
Bring her back.

52
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,740
Bring her back, you jerk.

53
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:15,160
Bring Yu-ri back.

54
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,210
So you don't have to blame yourself

55
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,540
for not seeing it.

56
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,960
EPISODE 14: IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT

57
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:29,470
Min-jeong.

58
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,350
Why are you crying? Don't cry.

59
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:36,100
It's not your fault. Okay?

60
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,520
Then whose fault is it?

61
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:45,440
Is it because you're at the hospital
all day long?

62
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:52,320
I hired a pick-up helper
to return to work, then lost my child.

63
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:56,080
And Seo-woo

64
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:02,170
is slower and grayer than most children.

65
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:06,300
If all of those aren't my fault,
whose fault is it?

66
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:09,550
Am I not her mother?

67
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:11,090
Min-jeong.

68
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:16,560
When something is wrong with a kid,
everyone blames the mother.

69
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,730
Why do you always say it's not my fault?

70
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,480
You said I'm Seo-woo's mother.

71
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:28,400
Am I really her mother?

72
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,280
I'm sorry.

73
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:37,950
I'm sorry.

74
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,580
Why are you always

75
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:46,630
sorry

76
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,300
and fine?

77
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:14,320
Cha Yu-ri.

78
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:20,790
Those three syllables
are taboo words to me.

79
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,790
How long

80
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,090
will you keep that door shut to me?

81
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:32,050
How long will you
keep that door locked up?

82
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,760
You have to open that door
for me to go in.

83
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:42,350
That's the only way
I can truly be Seo-woo's mom.

84
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:07,870
The pick-up helper.

85
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,800
That's her.

86
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,800
Yu-ri.

87
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,510
Cha Yu-ri.

88
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:35,900
What

89
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:38,950
do you...

90
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,780
What do you mean?

91
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,580
Seo-woo's biological mother.

92
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:53,500
Cha Yu-ri.

93
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:58,970
She came back to life.

94
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:10,770
I'm sorry, but could you please leave?

95
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:13,940
I really don't want to see you right now.

96
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:17,070
How... How can you lose her? How?

97
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:50,540
Seo-woo, you're up.

98
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,090
Seo-woo, good morning.
Shall we wash your face?

99
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:02,220
Min-jeong.

100
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,860
All done.

101
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:29,950
Okay.

102
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:43,380
Stay here for a minute.

103
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,370
Won't you get ready for work? You're late.

104
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,950
I know you can't believe it.

105
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,170
Because I couldn't either.

106
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:22,550
No, I don't believe it.

107
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,380
It doesn't make sense.

108
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,800
Does this make sense to you?

109
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:29,840
The kitchen assistant.

110
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:33,180
The pick-up helper is Seo-woo's mom?

111
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,930
She came back to life?

112
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:37,390
Stop joking around.

113
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:40,310
Why would I make a joke like this?

114
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:43,860
Exactly. Why would someone
joke around like this?

115
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:48,950
This is the worst you've ever been.

116
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:53,620
It's unbelievable,

117
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,000
but it's true.

118
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,210
I don't believe it.

119
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:03,460
Then why did you cry so much last night?

120
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:10,340
Fine.

121
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,260
Let's say what you're saying is true.

122
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:17,270
Then

123
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:21,650
why did you tell me this

124
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,480
now?

125
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,070
I'm sorry.

126
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:37,410
At first, I was flustered,

127
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:41,040
so I couldn't tell you.

128
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,710
But you can't be the only one
who doesn't know.

129
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:47,300
Min-jeong.

130
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,470
Believe it or not,

131
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:53,140
it's true.

132
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:01,520
MISAENG

133
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,780
-Excuse me.
-Gosh.

134
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,030
What's up with him?

135
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:13,740
Why are you following me?

136
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:16,410
Can you see me?

137
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:18,410
Do you see ghosts, too?

138
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,620
Can you see me?

139
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:23,330
Are you on my left or right?

140
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
-Where are you?
-Gosh.

141
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:27,050
Darn.

142
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:31,010
No, I'm a Christian.

143
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:33,890
I don't believe in ghosts.

144
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:36,970
I think I believe it a little.

145
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,640
I did.

146
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,480
It's because I go to fortunetellers.

147
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,060
Why did Yu-ri tell me that?

148
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:45,770
Gosh, he's no fun.

149
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,780
Hyeon-jeong.

150
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:56,530
Hyeon-jeong.

151
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,290
Hyeon-jeong!

152
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:03,460
Yes. What?

153
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,920
How spicy do you want that to be?

154
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,750
Goodness.

155
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:11,340
-What is it this time?
-Oh, gosh.

156
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,590
Is it because of Yu-ri?

157
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:21,220
Why are you sighing
while talking about Yu-ri?

158
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:22,390
What?

159
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:25,690
You're the one who always sighs
because of her.

160
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:30,020
I'm just worried about her,
and I feel bad for her.

161
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:31,900
That's all.

162
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,240
Yu-ri is Seo-woo's mom,

163
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:37,370
so I want to help her,
but it's complicated.

164
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:40,410
That's why I keep sighing.

165
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:43,040
Gang-hwa and you feel the same way, too.

166
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,670
I understand

167
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:48,960
why Yu-ri hid from us

168
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,710
instead of coming to us first.

169
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:55,090
Why?

170
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:57,640
Everyone is having a hard time
because I came back.

171
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:01,220
Because of me, Gang-hwa and you
are such in pain.

172
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:03,850
I shouldn't have gotten caught.

173
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:08,100
What is it?

174
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:09,610
Hey.

175
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:14,820
-Watch the shop for me.
-Why?

176
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,200
Where are you going?

177
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,860
Hyeon-jeong, don't go.

178
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:20,410
I can't look after the store alone
right now.

179
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:22,450
I'm in a state of great fear.

180
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,250
Hyeon-jeong!

181
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:28,880
Are you out of your mind?

182
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,670
How can you take your eyes off her?

183
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:33,960
She was right behind me.

184
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:36,840
It was just for a second.

185
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:38,430
A split second.

186
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:44,140
I knew something was strange last night.

187
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,480
Did Gang-hwa's wife say something?

188
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,940
Why wouldn't she
when the pick-up helper lost her kid?

189
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:55,030
Gosh, you idiot!

190
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:57,990
Idiot!

191
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:01,570
-Gosh.
-Goodness.

192
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:07,750
OH MIN-JEONG
I'M SORRY

193
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:21,930
-Pil-seung's family?
-Yes.

194
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:24,640
Guk-bong was grilling them
to find out where Seo-woo was,

195
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,060
and they threw a fit not to tell him

196
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:29,520
I heard she was hiding in the playground.

197
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:31,810
Yes, in a slide.

198
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,520
They hid her well.

199
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,110
I guess they're pretty loyal.

200
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:39,530
They were taken away from there.

201
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:44,160
Where is Pil-seung's family now?

202
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:51,710
No way...

203
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:54,460
They're gone.

204
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:58,420
Come on. Don't mess with me.

205
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:02,220
They're a tenacious bunch.
They've been holding out for 20 years.

206
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:05,510
They're gone just like that

207
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:07,220
because of Seo-woo?

208
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:10,140
It's been 20 years,
so it's about time they left.

209
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:12,100
They held out a long time.

210
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:15,770
I don't believe it.

211
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:19,860
Well...

212
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:22,110
They were taken

213
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:23,990
because they were hiding Seo-woo?

214
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:25,780
It's okay.

215
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,830
They made the choice.

216
00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:30,250
They understand how a mother feels.

217
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:35,500
You'll be up there soon.

218
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,590
Thank them when you get there.

219
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:46,350
I should cook for Pil-seung one more time.

220
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:49,180
Like you got enough time.

221
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:51,770
Don't worry about others.

222
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:53,850
Enjoy what you can while you're here.

223
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,560
You idiot.

224
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:03,200
I can't believe
what Pil-seung's family did.

225
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:05,160
I'm so grateful.

226
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:10,620
But I can't thank them
because they're gone.

227
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:14,790
-Yu-ri.
-Yes, Mom?

228
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:17,210
Come out. Hyeon-jeong is here.

229
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,630
Really?

230
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:21,300
What is it?

231
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:22,840
Hyeon-jeong is here.

232
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,380
Okay.

233
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,480
Hey.

234
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,310
What is this?

235
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:40,940
Hey, hop in.

236
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:43,950
Hyeon-jeong.

237
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,200
What's all this? Where did you get it?

238
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,570
Why do you even ask? I'm a hip like this.

239
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:49,830
Get in.

240
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:52,450
-Is it really okay?
-Sure.

241
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,370
Yeon-ji. Bring your sister's bag.

242
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:58,750
My gosh.

243
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:03,920
What are you waiting for? Hop in.

244
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:17,150
All right then. Shall we go?

245
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:18,440
Where are we going?

246
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:20,270
Anywhere.

247
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:22,110
We can go anywhere you want.

248
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:28,200
Now she smiles.

249
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:31,870
Gosh, I can tell they are soul mates.

250
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,830
Mom, I think Hyeon-jeong
is the best. Right?

251
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:57,310
-Yu-ri, do you like it?
-I love it.

252
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:59,980
It feels so refreshing!

253
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:02,270
I like it too!

254
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,770
All right. Let's go.

255
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:04,980
One.

256
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:07,070
Two. Three!

257
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,780
This is amazing.

258
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:17,210
It must be fun.

259
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:19,040
-Yu-ri.
-Yes?

260
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,960
Are you all right?
Do you want to go back down now?

261
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:22,880
I'm fine.

262
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:25,170
You don't seem fine though.

263
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:26,550
I'm okay.

264
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,130
-Of course, I am.
-Hyeon-jeong.

265
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:32,680
Gosh, no. This isn't right.

266
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,430
No!

267
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,020
Yu-ri.

268
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,940
Hyeon-jeong.

269
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:04,090
I love the scenery.

270
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:20,180
Hyeon-jeong, hurry.

271
00:21:58,180 --> 00:21:59,470
Is this for me?

272
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:23,040
DON'T JOKE AROUND LIKE THAT AGAIN

273
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:40,970
OPERATION SCHEDULE

274
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:42,810
My operation is tomorrow.

275
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:46,020
I said I don't want to do this.

276
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:48,020
-Why not?
-Just because.

277
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:50,150
I'm not doing it.

278
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:51,820
Why?

279
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:54,200
Why do you not want to do this?

280
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,070
You've been doing well
with the counseling.

281
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,910
You need to face this to get better.

282
00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:01,120
Will you keep living as a doctor
who can't operate?

283
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:04,960
Maybe later.

284
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,790
I'll do it some other time.

285
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:08,130
When would it be?

286
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:11,050
It's about time
to stop torturing yourself.

287
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,260
-Here.
-Thanks.

288
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:25,890
Now you look like Cha Yu-ri.

289
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:30,020
Yu-ri.

290
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:31,480
Yes?

291
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:33,280
For the past five years,

292
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:38,360
were you around me as well?

293
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:42,910
Sure. I stuck around you all the time.

294
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:48,330
Even I forgot my birthday,
but you remembered it every year.

295
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:52,840
Maybe I was struggling not to forget you.

296
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:56,220
I guess that's why.

297
00:23:57,930 --> 00:23:59,050
After you left,

298
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:01,850
it didn't really hit me at first.

299
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:04,310
When I studied abroad,

300
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:06,810
we didn't see each other for about a year.

301
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:08,940
It was like that.

302
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,690
I felt like you were just away
for a little bit.

303
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:20,070
And once I realized that I would
never be able to see you again,

304
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:23,330
I couldn't even eat.

305
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,660
I just cried my eyes out.

306
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:29,670
But after a little while,

307
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:32,420
I felt hungry again.

308
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,010
So I started to eat,

309
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:37,970
take care of Ha-jun,

310
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:39,180
and work.

311
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:44,430
And one day,

312
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:48,810
I realized that

313
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,400
I was forgetting about you.

314
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:55,690
I just celebrated your birthdays

315
00:24:56,690 --> 00:24:58,570
because I wanted to cling on to you.

316
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:01,320
Because I was sorry for you.

317
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:05,870
And you knew it, right?

318
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:07,910
Of course, I did.

319
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:11,290
Actually I was sad
that you were forgetting about me.

320
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:14,540
But

321
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:20,090
I was afraid if I wouldn't be forgotten.

322
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:26,260
Watching people
have hard times because of me,

323
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:29,100
was real hell.

324
00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:31,640
Gang-hwa?

325
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:37,780
So you knew it too.

326
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:40,320
That Gang-hwa has a problem.

327
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,740
I do. I was around him all the time.

328
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,330
He recently received a probation.

329
00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:49,080
I found out about it later on though.

330
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:54,710
That's what I did to him.

331
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,210
I broke his heart.

332
00:25:57,290 --> 00:25:59,090
It's not your fault.

333
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:01,510
Isn't it like you died
because you wanted to.

334
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:04,890
But it was my choice.

335
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:09,850
I just made him feel guilty.

336
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:32,410
Where did she go leaving me alone?

337
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:36,330
Oh, right.

338
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:38,920
That's right.

339
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:47,260

SEO BONG-YEON

341
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,320
I know you're a stone-hearted human,

342
00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:11,240
but how could you send them up
just like that?

343
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:12,790
My point.

344
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,290
I didn't even get to say goodbye. Damn it.

345
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:22,590
You guys are not human.

346
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:25,880
To Guk-bong...

347
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:28,180
I mean, to people,

348
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:30,800
you guys are just demons
who should be sent up.

349
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:32,600
How could you say something so harsh?

350
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,890
I know.

351
00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:36,890
So if you don't want to get caught
and sent up all of a sudden like them,

352
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:38,850
stop avoiding Guk-bong

353
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:43,360
and get over your regrets in this world.

354
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:48,360
This is really frustrating.

355
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,160
Hello?

356
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:58,540
Hello, ma'am.

357
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:00,790
Do you make domiciliary visits?

358
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:02,130
What?

359
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:10,720
Min-jeong. Believe it or not,

360
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,600
it's true.

361
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,450
What are you doing?

362
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:33,580
Get off, Yu-ri.

363
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,830
You said we'd hang out at my place.

364
00:28:38,410 --> 00:28:39,920
We will drink. So I can't drive.

365
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Let's walk.

366
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:47,300
I'm hungry. Let's go.

367
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:02,600
-I'm so hungry.
-Me too.

368
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:04,690
-I shouted too much.
-I know.

369
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:07,740
I couldn't help it
because you drove so fast.

370
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:19,580
-Is it here?
-Yes.

371
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:20,660
It's for us.

372
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:22,620
-It just came right on time.
-I know.

373
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:24,710
-Please enjoy.
-Thank you.

374
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:26,300
It's pork belly meat.

375
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:28,800
-Let's go.
-Mom, Yu-ri and Hyeon-jeong are here.

376
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,050
Gosh, I can't wait.

377
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:34,640
-Let's eat.
-It must be really good.

378
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:37,430
Hello, Ms. Jeon.

379
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:50,280
CHA MU-PUNG, JEON EUN-SUK,
CHA YU-RI, CHA YEON-JI

380
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,150
-It looks delicious.
-It's warm.

381
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:31,240
My goodness.

382
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,400
-I'm hungry.
-It looks great.

383
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:36,370
Here's a cold beer for you.

384
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:38,200
Yeon-ji, you're the best.

385
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,740
We have five drinkers here.

386
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:41,660
This is far from enough.

387
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:43,540
I don't drink beer.

388
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:44,580
I like soju.

389
00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:48,040
I knew it. You're so my type.

390
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,800
Mom, I'll get you soju.

391
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,170
Here, Dad.

392
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:53,590
-My daughter is the best.
-Gosh.

393
00:30:53,670 --> 00:30:54,720
It's good, isn't it?

394
00:30:55,970 --> 00:30:58,350
-This is nice.
-Dad, please open this for me.

395
00:30:58,430 --> 00:30:59,810
Give me that.

396
00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:01,350
All right.

397
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:04,520
It's open.

398
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:07,400
It flew away like this.

399
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:09,400
Let's drink.

400
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,480
Here. Have some of this.

401
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:13,280
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

402
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,240
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

403
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,740
It tastes so good.

404
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:26,920
So we're all together with Hyeon-jeong.

405
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,790
It's been so long since we did this.

406
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,040
I know.

407
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:32,960
I've been too busy
working and raising my kid.

408
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:35,840
She was just afraid
she would remind us of Yu-ri,

409
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,890
so she was being thoughtful.

410
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,350
Do you think I don't know that?

411
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:44,060
I had no idea

412
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,770
this day would come again.

413
00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:50,110
What are you doing, Dad? This isn't right.

414
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:53,480
She's right. Why are you being so silly?

415
00:31:53,570 --> 00:31:54,860
Okay. I get it.

416
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:56,780
-I'm done. It's over.
-It's over.

417
00:31:57,110 --> 00:31:59,950
-Mr. Cha, please stop.
-What's over?

418
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:02,870
It's nothing.
Your dad is just being silly again.

419
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:04,910
Do you say things like that?

420
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,080
Sure.

421
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,290
She says all kinds of stuff.

422
00:32:07,370 --> 00:32:09,420
-Gosh, Dad.
-Stop it.

423
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:13,130
-It tastes good.
-So

424
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:15,090
did you guys have fun?

425
00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:16,420
Yes. We had a lot of fun.

426
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:19,800
Hyeon-jeong's driving has improved a lot.
She was too afraid to run at 50km before.

427
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:21,180
Hey, that was a long time ago.

428
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:25,180
That's not true.
I was a novice driver back then.

429
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:27,600
Still, 50km is too slow.

430
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:30,480
Here, Yu-ri. Try this.

431
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,810
You seem to have only one daughter.

432
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:35,150
You're my son. All right.

433
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:37,990
I didn't know I was a son.

434
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:41,780
All right. I should give this to my son.

435
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:44,120
Here. Good.

436
00:32:44,410 --> 00:32:45,950
Why don't we take a picture together?

437
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,660
-Good.
-Let's do that.

438
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:49,160
Do I look okay?

439
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:51,000
-You look perfect.
-You look beautiful.

440
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,830
-Don't worry.
-You're always pretty.

441
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:53,840
I'll put this on here.

442
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:56,130
Gather together and look at the camera.

443
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:57,510
Mr. Cha, come closer.

444
00:32:57,590 --> 00:32:59,130
One...

445
00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:00,800
Come closer to each other.

446
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,470
-One...
-Is it how it works?

447
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,850
Let me see the picture.

448
00:33:06,930 --> 00:33:08,930
I'll show you.

449
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:11,560
I'm very grateful to Hyeon-jeong.

450
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:15,230
I'm always grateful to her.

451
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:17,190
Did you like it, Yu-ri?

452
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:19,520
Yes. I loved it.

453
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:23,070
What was so good?

454
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:27,030
I liked the wind,

455
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:28,570
I liked the air,

456
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:30,580
and I liked Hyeon-jeong next to me.

457
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:33,330
I'm glad to hear that.

458
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,210
Things will be always like that
from now on.

459
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:41,290
We will have happy moments
like that every day, Yu-ri.

460
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:47,180
Do you not want it?

461
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:49,550
Of course, I want it.

462
00:35:52,930 --> 00:35:54,020
What?

463
00:35:55,890 --> 00:35:57,100
Dad.

464
00:35:57,810 --> 00:35:58,770
Is Dad sleeping already?

465
00:35:59,770 --> 00:36:03,400
Dad, you can't sleep here.

466
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:06,740
-My gosh.
-It's been less than a minute.

467
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:09,990
It was somewhere around here. Where is it?

468
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:12,830
There it is. It says Misaeng.

469
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:18,040
What is he doing here?

470
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:22,420
Hey.

471
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:26,670
Gosh, it hurts.

472
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,300
-It hurts.
-What are you doing here?

473
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:29,930
Gosh, it's not like that.

474
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:31,140
Let go of me.

475
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:32,930
-It really hurts.
-Come here.

476
00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:38,230
Come here. I got you.

477
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:40,940
-Just follow me.
-It hurts.

478
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:42,270
Hello.

479
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:45,440
Stay still. Stop.

480
00:36:45,530 --> 00:36:47,940
What's with your arms?

481
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:50,280
Is something there?

482
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:52,660
What have you been up to these days?

483
00:36:52,950 --> 00:36:54,620
Why is there a ghost around you?

484
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:56,330
What? A ghost?

485
00:36:56,410 --> 00:36:57,830
-Stay still.
-Ghost?

486
00:36:57,910 --> 00:36:59,750
I told you to stand still!

487
00:36:59,830 --> 00:37:00,960
Isn't it staying still?

488
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:03,750
-It hurts.
-Stop it. Stay still.

489
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,050
Is he always so stupid like that?

490
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:16,310
Because she's not here.

491
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:17,970
Who?

492
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:19,270
His wife.

493
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,600
He's Hyeon-jeong's boy.

494
00:37:20,690 --> 00:37:22,690
Hyeon-jeong. Where are you?

495
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:27,110
Hurry and come right away, Hyeon-jeong.

496
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:31,610
Gosh, you now know Yu-ri was around you
for five years.

497
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:33,240
Just come over here.

498
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:36,870
I didn't know about it.

499
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:38,870
Are you sure

500
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:40,870
there's a ghost next to you?

501
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:44,330
Why? Why is it doing this to me?

502
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:46,840
Is it because I refused
to write a fake diagnosis?

503
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:49,510
Gosh, it's no big deal.

504
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:54,680
"Gosh, it's no big deal."

505
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:57,470
Then why?

506
00:37:58,390 --> 00:37:59,850
Why are you hanging around with him?

507
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,850
Right. That one.

508
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:03,060
There's something

509
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:06,150
only he can do for me.

510
00:38:08,730 --> 00:38:09,940
What?

511
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:13,700
What is it?

512
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:16,570
Ms. Mi-dong, please tell me what he says.

513
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:18,080
Why? Why is he doing this to me?

514
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:21,660
So there's something
only you can do for him.

515
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,250
What is it?

516
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:30,170
Please tell my mom

517
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:31,970
that I didn't

518
00:38:33,970 --> 00:38:35,090
kill myself.

519
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,850
He knows that it wasn't a suicide.

520
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:46,270
What does he say?

521
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,820
What is it? What?

522
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:51,900
Ms. Mi-dong, please.
I need a simultaneous interpretation.

523
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,900
I can't wait.

524
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,570
I'm very anxious.

525
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,150
It must've been fun

526
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:36,820
to see how much I loved her
like some kind of an idiot.

527
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:46,120
No, it wasn't like that.

528
00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:50,540
Do you know what I said?

529
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:55,880
I said I'm curious about her
because she looks like Seo-woo's mom.

530
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,140
That I'm envious

531
00:40:00,350 --> 00:40:01,970
because she looks like Seo-woo.

532
00:40:04,430 --> 00:40:05,640
I had no idea.

533
00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:09,150
I was like a fool.

534
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,370
You should've told me first.

535
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:32,090
That's what you should've done.

536
00:40:42,390 --> 00:40:44,600
It has been a while

537
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:48,850
since you looked so happy

538
00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:53,820
when you were around other people.

539
00:40:57,110 --> 00:40:58,320
I was afraid

540
00:41:00,570 --> 00:41:01,950
you would get hurt.

541
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:11,620
I'm sorry.

542
00:41:22,970 --> 00:41:24,850
Before caring about my happiness,

543
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:28,730
you should care about yours.

544
00:41:30,890 --> 00:41:32,730
Before seeing my wound,

545
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:35,230
you should take care of yours first.

546
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:41,150
You're a mess.

547
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:54,750
Why do you keep
torturing yourself like that?

548
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:25,740
-Is everything going well for lunch?
-Yes.

549
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:28,030
Director.

550
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:31,500
Is Seo-woo here yet?

551
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:34,710
She's supposed to be here by now,
but I haven't seen her yet.

552
00:42:34,790 --> 00:42:37,250
Seo-woo is not coming today.

553
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:39,630
Why not? Is she sick?

554
00:42:39,710 --> 00:42:41,010
No.

555
00:42:41,510 --> 00:42:43,930
She will stay home with her mom today.

556
00:42:44,970 --> 00:42:46,220
I see.

557
00:42:46,970 --> 00:42:47,890
Okay.

558
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:00,230
I'M SORRY

559
00:43:08,370 --> 00:43:09,660
CONTACTS

560
00:43:11,410 --> 00:43:13,620
CHO GANG-HWA

561
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:50,280
Why do you always say
everything is all right?

562
00:43:50,410 --> 00:43:53,200
It's not all right at all.
You aren't all right.

563
00:43:53,290 --> 00:43:54,790
Why are you always

564
00:43:56,370 --> 00:43:59,290
sorry and fine?

565
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,510
Before seeing my wound,

566
00:44:10,090 --> 00:44:12,140
you should take care of yours first.

567
00:44:13,930 --> 00:44:15,850
You're a mess.

568
00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:36,910
OPERATION SCHEDULE

569
00:44:52,930 --> 00:44:54,600
So he's not doing this?

570
00:44:55,970 --> 00:44:58,100
He's getting counseling.

571
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,400
But why isn't he doing this?

572
00:45:00,730 --> 00:45:03,980
He should go to the place
where he got traumatized.

573
00:45:04,070 --> 00:45:07,860
I guess he's afraid to bring up things
that he's been avoiding and correct them.

574
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:16,290
What was it? The exposure therapy?

575
00:45:16,490 --> 00:45:17,370
I'll do it.

576
00:45:17,950 --> 00:45:19,040
OPERATION SCHEDULE

577
00:45:20,210 --> 00:45:21,170
Why?

578
00:45:25,290 --> 00:45:26,630
You said you wouldn't do it.

579
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:28,670
What made you change your mind?

580
00:45:29,510 --> 00:45:31,470
I can't keep living like this.

581
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:34,390
Do I need to just observe the operation?

582
00:45:34,470 --> 00:45:35,680
For now.

583
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:38,310
The goal is to gradually expose you
to the place you're afraid of

584
00:45:38,390 --> 00:45:39,640
so you get used to it.

585
00:45:40,230 --> 00:45:41,060
Okay.

586
00:45:45,610 --> 00:45:47,940
I think Doctor Cho will get better.

587
00:45:48,230 --> 00:45:49,690
What he said is a good sign.

588
00:45:49,990 --> 00:45:52,110
He said, "I can't keep living like this."

589
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:54,240
Not "just because."

590
00:45:59,870 --> 00:46:02,580
Of course, she's angry at me.
I lost her kid.

591
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:07,090
Still, I don't have much time left.

592
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:09,840
I really need to see Seo-woo.

593
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:15,180
Should I go beg for forgiveness?

594
00:46:23,270 --> 00:46:24,400
Mom!

595
00:46:27,610 --> 00:46:28,690
Hey.

596
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:30,490
Where are you going?

597
00:46:30,570 --> 00:46:32,400
I have a doctor's appointment.

598
00:46:32,490 --> 00:46:33,490
I'm going to the hospital.

599
00:46:33,570 --> 00:46:35,240
Right, it's Monday today.

600
00:46:35,870 --> 00:46:37,160
How did you know that?

601
00:46:37,990 --> 00:46:40,160
Well, Yeon-ji told me.

602
00:46:40,660 --> 00:46:41,620
Can I come with you?

603
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:43,120
-You want to?
-Yes.

604
00:47:23,370 --> 00:47:26,920
Your heart starts racing
whenever you see a crosswalk.

605
00:47:58,030 --> 00:47:59,870
I thought I was getting by,

606
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:05,000
but seeing a crosswalk would always
get my heart racing.

607
00:48:05,710 --> 00:48:08,000
I didn't try to remember it or anything,

608
00:48:09,130 --> 00:48:10,840
but my body must have remembered it.

609
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:13,460
I'm okay now.

610
00:48:14,050 --> 00:48:17,050
Wouldn't it be strange
if I didn't change at all

611
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:18,800
after what happened?

612
00:48:19,430 --> 00:48:20,800
I'm only human after all.

613
00:48:34,940 --> 00:48:36,360
What's with him now?

614
00:48:39,410 --> 00:48:40,490
Doctor Gye.

615
00:48:40,820 --> 00:48:41,990
Gosh, you startled me.

616
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:45,370
What is it? What do you need?

617
00:48:45,450 --> 00:48:47,540
Why are you not in your office?

618
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:53,040
There are people here.

619
00:48:53,130 --> 00:48:54,380
Pardon?

620
00:48:58,670 --> 00:49:00,760
Well, you know...

621
00:49:02,010 --> 00:49:04,140
Someone asked me a favor,

622
00:49:04,850 --> 00:49:07,270
but I'm not sure if I should say yes.

623
00:49:07,350 --> 00:49:09,810
Say yes if it isn't something
extremely difficult.

624
00:49:09,890 --> 00:49:12,270
It's not like a dead person asked you
a favor, so why not?

625
00:49:12,690 --> 00:49:14,320
-A dead person asked me a favor.
-Pardon?

626
00:49:14,980 --> 00:49:16,820
Nothing. Never mind.

627
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:18,740
It's nothing.

628
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:21,700
Shouldn't you go check on Doctor Cho?

629
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:24,120
Cho Gang-hwa? Why? Should I?

630
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:27,080
He's attending Doctor Jang's surgery
today. Everyone's been fussing.

631
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:28,200
What?

632
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:41,510
Gang-hwa, you're attending surgery?

633
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:43,010
Exposure therapy?

634
00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:44,260
Yes.

635
00:49:44,430 --> 00:49:46,390
Will you be all right?
I don't think you're ready.

636
00:49:47,350 --> 00:49:48,680
It can't be that bad.

637
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:50,810
If you start hyperventilating,

638
00:49:51,190 --> 00:49:52,730
remember to take deep breaths.

639
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:54,940
Get out as soon as it starts
getting bad, okay?

640
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:33,560
RESTRICTED AREA

641
00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:11,020
Mom, why did you stop going to Gang-hwa?

642
00:51:11,270 --> 00:51:13,350
He knows your heart
better than any other doctor.

643
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:15,440
My condition is nothing serious.

644
00:51:16,190 --> 00:51:18,810
What's the point of seeing him regularly

645
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:21,730
and reminding him of his pain?

646
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:25,950
I thought it'd be best
to stop seeing him altogether.

647
00:51:29,070 --> 00:51:30,450
Ms. Jeon Eun-suk.

648
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:33,160
-I'll be right back. Stay here.
-Okay.

649
00:51:41,340 --> 00:51:42,420
What happened?

650
00:51:42,510 --> 00:51:44,800
I heard Doctor Cho attended surgery today.

651
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:47,890
-Again?
-Only ten minutes in,

652
00:51:47,970 --> 00:51:49,800
his symptoms appeared, and he rushed out.

653
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:51,350
My gosh.

654
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:02,360
Gang-hwa.

655
00:52:02,780 --> 00:52:03,860
Where is he?

656
00:52:03,940 --> 00:52:05,740
I'm not sure. He rushed out.

657
00:52:05,820 --> 00:52:07,200
I don't know where he went.

658
00:52:07,450 --> 00:52:09,700
How was he? Did he handle it okay?

659
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:10,870
No.

660
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:15,040
-Go look for him.
-Okay.

661
00:52:38,350 --> 00:52:39,560
Have you seen Doctor Cho?

662
00:52:39,650 --> 00:52:40,980
-No.
-Gosh.

663
00:53:27,740 --> 00:53:30,070
Gang-hwa, look at me.

664
00:53:34,620 --> 00:53:35,910
Breathe.

665
00:53:36,490 --> 00:53:37,750
It's okay.

666
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:39,160
It's okay.

667
00:53:39,540 --> 00:53:42,370
It's okay. Breathe slowly.

668
00:53:53,550 --> 00:53:55,300
It's okay.

669
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:56,510
Everything's okay.

670
00:54:55,610 --> 00:54:57,370
Breathe, okay?

671
00:55:06,250 --> 00:55:07,840
Breathe.

672
00:55:11,630 --> 00:55:12,670
Breathe.

673
00:55:25,690 --> 00:55:27,810
Gang-hwa, are you okay?

674
00:55:28,730 --> 00:55:30,070
Breathe.

675
00:55:42,490 --> 00:55:44,000
Go ahead and breathe.

676
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:51,250
Why did you do that?

677
00:55:55,300 --> 00:55:56,630
Why did you do that?

678
00:55:58,340 --> 00:56:01,100
Why? Why did you leave me all alone?

679
00:56:06,190 --> 00:56:07,520
Why did you?

680
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:10,980
Why did you do that?

681
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:15,030
Why?

682
00:56:16,030 --> 00:56:18,860
We have to operate on him first.
Otherwise, he's going to die!

683
00:56:18,950 --> 00:56:21,370
I said, no! Transfer him.

684
00:56:21,450 --> 00:56:23,200
I'm ready! Why can't I operate on him?

685
00:56:23,290 --> 00:56:24,160
I can save him!

686
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:25,910
The other patient is a VIP!

687
00:56:26,540 --> 00:56:28,040
Do as you're told.

688
00:56:28,170 --> 00:56:30,330
I can't cover for you anymore.

689
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:33,210
Go to the other operating room.

690
00:56:36,130 --> 00:56:37,300
I can't.

691
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:42,510
Get him.

692
00:56:43,390 --> 00:56:45,470
-Get him!
-Yes, Doctor.

693
00:56:51,020 --> 00:56:52,020
Lock the door.

694
00:56:52,110 --> 00:56:53,020
Pardon?

695
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:55,650
I said, lock the door.

696
00:56:55,860 --> 00:56:57,320
Well. Okay.

697
00:56:57,820 --> 00:56:59,910
-Intercoms off.
-Okay.

698
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:05,580
Don't open the door or answer your phone
until the surgery is over.

699
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:11,460
The door is locked.

700
00:57:11,540 --> 00:57:13,460
That punk.

701
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:19,510
Doctor Jang,
a pregnant traffic accident patient.

702
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:21,140
Please come with us.

703
00:57:37,030 --> 00:57:38,190
Call Gang-hwa.

704
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:39,280
Pardon?

705
00:57:39,490 --> 00:57:41,320
I said, call Gang-hwa! Right now!

706
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,880
Where's Gang-hwa? You couldn't reach him?

707
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:56,340
No.

708
00:57:56,710 --> 00:57:59,880
If we wait any longer,
we'll lose both mother and child.

709
00:58:10,310 --> 00:58:11,440
Doctor.

710
00:58:12,350 --> 00:58:13,560
My baby...

711
00:58:14,190 --> 00:58:16,570
Please save my baby first.

712
00:58:17,610 --> 00:58:18,900
My baby...

713
00:58:20,900 --> 00:58:22,450
Please save her.

714
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:24,990
Please save her first.

715
00:58:27,030 --> 00:58:28,990
-Doctor Cho.
-Yes?

716
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:30,250
Your wife

717
00:58:31,870 --> 00:58:33,120
had an accident.

718
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:07,030
Yu-ri, wake up.

719
00:59:08,490 --> 00:59:09,370
Yu-ri!

720
00:59:16,790 --> 00:59:17,920
Why did you do that?

721
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:20,380
Why?

722
00:59:58,130 --> 00:59:59,880
You should have lived.

723
01:00:02,670 --> 01:00:03,800
You should have...

724
01:00:06,340 --> 01:00:08,010
You should have lived.

725
01:00:09,220 --> 01:00:11,430
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

726
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:13,270
I'm sorry for everything.

727
01:00:16,140 --> 01:00:17,690
Stop blaming yourself.

728
01:00:18,350 --> 01:00:19,560
It's not your fault.

729
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:34,120
Resentment, guilt, and regret...

730
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:35,580
All those emotions are entangled.

731
01:00:36,580 --> 01:00:38,420
But mostly, he'd feel guilty.

732
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:41,340
He'd think things would've been different

733
01:00:42,090 --> 01:00:44,090
if he hadn't been in surgery that day.

734
01:00:45,260 --> 01:00:46,970
So he blames himself?

735
01:00:47,590 --> 01:00:48,590
Yes.

736
01:00:49,010 --> 01:00:51,720
And the person who caused
all these emotions is gone.

737
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:53,010
She died.

738
01:00:53,310 --> 01:00:56,060
So he had to bottle everything up
and got sick as a result.

739
01:01:11,780 --> 01:01:13,950
PICK-UP HELPER DO-YEON
I'M SORRY.

740
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:20,310
You'll damage your stomach.
Have some food too.

741
01:02:27,820 --> 01:02:29,570
It's a start.

742
01:02:29,650 --> 01:02:31,490
Ten minutes is impressive.

743
01:02:31,570 --> 01:02:33,410
It'll only get better.

744
01:02:37,030 --> 01:02:38,410
Where were you?

745
01:02:38,490 --> 01:02:40,330
They couldn't find you anywhere.

746
01:02:40,410 --> 01:02:41,290
Well...

747
01:02:41,830 --> 01:02:43,170
I was where I always go.

748
01:02:45,290 --> 01:02:47,540
So what made you
want to receive treatment?

749
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:57,470
She wants me to let her go.

750
01:02:58,810 --> 01:02:59,850
And I think

751
01:03:00,970 --> 01:03:02,520
it might be time

752
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:04,600
to let her go

753
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:07,770
since she came back to life.

754
01:03:09,070 --> 01:03:10,400
What are you talking about?

755
01:03:14,110 --> 01:03:15,700
Can't you try to keep

756
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:19,490
only the good memories
and forget the sad ones?

757
01:03:23,790 --> 01:03:25,750
Only the good memories...

758
01:03:26,330 --> 01:03:28,080
Only the happy memories...

759
01:03:29,210 --> 01:03:31,210
If I kept only those,

760
01:03:32,130 --> 01:03:34,170
I wouldn't be here right now.

761
01:03:34,380 --> 01:03:35,510
Why not?

762
01:03:41,100 --> 01:03:42,430
I'd miss her too much.

763
01:03:47,650 --> 01:03:49,230
I'd miss her too much.

764
01:03:50,270 --> 01:03:51,940
When I missed her like crazy,

765
01:03:54,820 --> 01:03:56,820
she wouldn't even show up in my dreams.

766
01:04:30,190 --> 01:04:31,270
Yu-ri?

767
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:32,360
Yes.

768
01:04:34,230 --> 01:04:36,650
I went there as soon as I heard
Gang-hwa rushed out in a panic,

769
01:04:37,150 --> 01:04:38,410
but Yu-ri was already there.

770
01:04:38,490 --> 01:04:40,280
How did she know where...

771
01:04:42,910 --> 01:04:45,750
-Oh...
-She watched him for five years.

772
01:04:45,830 --> 01:04:47,370
She saw how much he suffered too.

773
01:04:50,790 --> 01:04:51,840
That's right.

774
01:04:52,340 --> 01:04:53,670
How did she watch all that?

775
01:04:53,750 --> 01:04:54,920
I know.

776
01:04:56,130 --> 01:04:58,430
She was right there,
watching him suffer because of her.

777
01:04:59,180 --> 01:05:02,100
She cried, apologizing to him.
It was too painful to watch.

778
01:05:02,180 --> 01:05:03,720
Why would she apologize?

779
01:05:04,060 --> 01:05:05,520
She is the most unfortunate one.

780
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:40,180
FAMILY AND HYEON-JEONG

781
01:06:19,670 --> 01:06:21,470
I want to live too.

782
01:06:37,110 --> 01:06:38,480
What are you doing?

783
01:06:40,650 --> 01:06:41,820
Do you know

784
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:44,860
what's more desperate

785
01:06:45,950 --> 01:06:47,740
than saying, "I want to die"?

786
01:06:48,540 --> 01:06:49,870
What is it?

787
01:06:52,710 --> 01:06:54,080
"I want to live."

788
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:57,790
What are you talking about,
all of a sudden?

789
01:06:58,630 --> 01:06:59,500
Yu-ri says

790
01:07:02,300 --> 01:07:03,630
she wants to live.

791
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:08,560
Shouldn't she live if she wants to?

792
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:11,020
I don't know what you're talking about.

793
01:07:11,430 --> 01:07:13,100
We were talking about Gang-hwa and Yu-ri.

794
01:07:14,230 --> 01:07:15,480
And Yu-ri is alive.

795
01:07:17,940 --> 01:07:18,820
Yu-ri...

796
01:07:24,900 --> 01:07:26,110
Yu-ri

797
01:07:28,410 --> 01:07:29,830
is going to die soon.

798
01:07:32,700 --> 01:07:34,370
She's going to die again soon.

799
01:07:37,380 --> 01:07:38,920
What are you talking about?

800
01:07:49,100 --> 01:07:50,430
What did you just say?

801
01:07:53,930 --> 01:07:55,190
Yu-ri is

802
01:07:57,900 --> 01:07:58,770
going to die?

803
01:08:12,200 --> 01:08:13,450
Why is Yu-ri dying?

804
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:19,330
Why is Yu-ri dying again?

805
01:08:22,750 --> 01:08:24,840
What did you say?

806
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:27,010
Can I

807
01:08:28,050 --> 01:08:29,260
live?

808
01:08:33,890 --> 01:08:35,180
I want to live.

809
01:08:35,480 --> 01:08:37,140
I want to live, Ms. Mi-dong.

810
01:08:38,350 --> 01:08:39,850
What did I do so wrong?

811
01:08:40,440 --> 01:08:43,190
Is everything my fault?

812
01:08:44,690 --> 01:08:46,240
I wanted to live,

813
01:08:46,860 --> 01:08:47,860
and I still do.

814
01:08:49,950 --> 01:08:52,200
Seo-woo, Mom, Dad...

815
01:08:52,450 --> 01:08:54,540
I want to be with them for a long time.

816
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:04,800
Yu-ri.

817
01:09:06,090 --> 01:09:06,920
Yes?

818
01:09:07,630 --> 01:09:09,010
In the past five years,

819
01:09:10,840 --> 01:09:12,890
when was the moment
you felt the most frustrated

820
01:09:14,010 --> 01:09:15,390
and wished you were alive?

821
01:09:23,690 --> 01:09:24,860
Right now.

822
01:09:27,280 --> 01:09:29,740
I've never wished for it
more than I do right now.

823
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:35,200
Can I

824
01:09:36,830 --> 01:09:38,000
live?

825
01:09:52,970 --> 01:09:54,510
VIP patients?

826
01:09:55,050 --> 01:09:56,430
They get surgery first?

827
01:09:57,220 --> 01:09:59,310
Yes, it's been going on

828
01:09:59,390 --> 01:10:01,350
secretly for years.

829
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:03,980
Everyone knows it's wrong,
but no one has dared to speak up.

830
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:07,530
And you're trying to change it now?

831
01:10:07,610 --> 01:10:10,530
Yes, he's going to submit a petition
signed by all the doctors.

832
01:10:10,610 --> 01:10:12,360
What if you get fired or something?

833
01:10:12,450 --> 01:10:14,410
Don't worry. That's never going to happen.

834
01:10:14,490 --> 01:10:16,160
I'm the best surgeon at our hospital.

835
01:10:16,740 --> 01:10:17,700
All right.

836
01:10:18,620 --> 01:10:20,910
Surgery should be performed
based on urgency.

837
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:24,170
Money shouldn't decide
who gets treated first.

838
01:10:24,250 --> 01:10:27,550
That's my husband. Isn't he amazing?

839
01:10:27,630 --> 01:10:28,960
He really is.

840
01:10:29,260 --> 01:10:31,090
My son-in-law is a real doctor.

841
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:33,380
You're the best.

842
01:10:34,760 --> 01:10:36,970
DOCTOR CHO, THANK YOU SO MUCH

843
01:10:37,060 --> 01:10:39,470
WITHOUT YOUR HELP THAT DAY

844
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:42,140
MY HUSBAND WOULDN'T BE ALIVE TODAY

845
01:10:42,230 --> 01:10:44,900
THANK YOU AND THANK YOU

846
01:11:34,860 --> 01:11:35,990
Gang-hwa.

847
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:39,990
I'm sorry.

848
01:11:40,450 --> 01:11:41,700
I'm sorry.

849
01:11:42,450 --> 01:11:43,660
I'm sorry.

850
01:11:45,620 --> 01:11:46,580
I'm sorry.

851
01:11:46,670 --> 01:11:49,000
It's not your fault, you idiot.

852
01:11:50,040 --> 01:11:51,670
They said it was too late.

853
01:11:51,750 --> 01:11:53,840
Even if they'd reached you,

854
01:11:57,340 --> 01:11:59,890
it would've been too late to save Yu-ri.

855
01:12:05,390 --> 01:12:06,480
I'm sorry.

856
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:09,650
This misfortune that struck you
out of the blue

857
01:12:11,070 --> 01:12:12,650
is not your fault.

858
01:12:14,940 --> 01:12:15,860
I'm sorry.

859
01:12:49,850 --> 01:12:51,860
