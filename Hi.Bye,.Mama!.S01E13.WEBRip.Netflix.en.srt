<b>Do you know what time it is?
Come on, get up.</b>

3

<b>-No...
-Hey, you're already late! Come on.</b>

4
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:52,218
<b>Hurry. Hey!</b>

5
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:55,138
<b>Hey! The soup's spilling...</b>

6
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:56,931
<b>Goodnight...</b>

7
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:59,601
<b>-"Goodnight"? Come on, get up.
-Just a bit more...</b>

8
00:01:09,694 --> 00:01:13,031
<b>That's so funny. Oh, my gosh.</b>

9
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:16,743
<b>I'd prefer a woman
who's cold to every guy.</b>

10
00:01:16,826 --> 00:01:18,328
<b>I'd prefer a guy who's always kind.</b>

11
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:19,621
<b>WHICH GUY WOULD YOU MARRY?</b>

12
00:01:19,704 --> 00:01:21,748
<b>A woman who's kind to every man?</b>

13
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:24,334
<b>-I'd--
-Then would you...</b>

14
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:31,466
<b>All right.</b>

15
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:33,843
<b>My goodness.</b>

16
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:36,805
<b>Hey, what is this?</b>

17
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:39,641
<b>Should I tell you why sales are so low?</b>

18
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:45,563
<b>The time that had been flowing with us</b>

19
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:49,400
<b>suddenly stopped one day.</b>

20
00:02:49,043 --> 00:02:50,086
<b>I...</b>

21
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:53,339
<b>What? I'm doing my best.</b>

22
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:55,884
<b>-It's too salty.
-Oh, really?</b>

23
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:20,617
<b>Don't cry.</b>

24
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,123
<b>Don't cry.</b>

25
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:29,250
<b>Don't cry.</b>

26
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:36,132
<b>Time stopped for the person I love

27
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:38,885
<b>I prayed that

28
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,437
<b>-Hey, Gang-hwa.
-Bye.</b>

29

<b>Date that nurse, Oh Min-jeong.</b>

<b>Think about it the other way around.</b>

31
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:59,072
<b>What if it happened to you,
and you left Yu-ri all alone?</b>

32
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:02,408
<b>Would you like it if Yu-ri lives her life</b>

33
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:05,912
<b>suppressing her feelings

<b>Aren't you Yu-ri's friend?</b>

35
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:14,045
<b>I am.</b>

36
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:18,132
<b>I'll always be on her side, and I'll
always think from her point of view.</b>

37
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:20,635
<b>That's why I'm saying this.</b>

38
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:42,991
<b>You idiot. You loser.</b>

<b>During the time I couldn't see her,</b>

49

<b>what would she have thought?</b>

50
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:55,313
<b>You fool.</b>

<b>Why didn't you tell me earlier?</b>

78
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:11,968
<b>I found out only recently.</b>

79

85
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:43,416
<b>Knew what?</b>

86

<b>That Yu-ri was by my side</b>

87

<b>for the past five years.</b>

<b>How did you find out?</b>

89
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:56,304
<b>Gang-hwa...</b>

90
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:10,776
<b>She said she couldn't remember.</b>

<b>She said she just woke up at a cinerarium.</b>

92

<b>What do we do about Gang-hwa?</b>

93
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:18,034
<b>That's why she couldn't tell him.</b>

94
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:18,993
<b>What?</b>

95
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:21,787
<b>After Yu-ri died,</b>

96
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,749
<b>Gang-hwa really had a tough time.</b>

97
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:26,292
<b>He blamed himself.</b>

98
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:31,213
<b>Right. He was just living
because he couldn't die.</b>

99
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:34,550
<b>Thinking of that just makes me...</b>

100
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,385
<b>But Yu-ri saw all of that.</b>

101
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:39,597
<b>That's why she couldn't tell him.</b>

102
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:43,893
<b>Because Gang-hwa
would blame himself again.</b>

<b>Hyeon-jeong.</b>

<b>I feel so bad for Yu-ri. What do we do?</b>

105
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:58,157
<b>Min-jeong.</b>

106
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:03,454
<b>Hello.</b>

107
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:07,166
<b>Did you happen to see
Seo-woo and Gang-hwa?</b>

108
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:08,876
<b>Mom!</b>

109
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:13,047
<b>Seo-woo, what are you doing here?
Where's your dad?</b>

110
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:17,385
<b>-Did Gang-hwa go somewhere?
-He went somewhere.</b>

111
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:19,178
<b>-What?
-Well, he went</b>

112
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:20,888
<b>there.</b>

113
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:22,264
<b>Somewhere.</b>

114
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:24,809
<b>Where did he go? You know, right?</b>

115
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:27,311
<b>-He went to the hospital.
-Yes, the hospital.</b>

116
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:28,562
<b>He went to the hospital.</b>

117
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,148
<b>He got an urgent call from the hospital.</b>

118
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:33,651
<b>And I have dementia,</b>

119
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:36,779
<b>so I keep forgetting stuff.</b>

120
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:38,280
<b>-Pardon?
-What?</b>

121
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:42,201
<b>The dads were planning on
spending time with the kids,</b>

122
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:46,122
<b>but Ha-jun wouldn't let go of me,
so the three of them played together.</b>

123
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,625
<b>So that's why you were with Ha-jun.</b>

124
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:52,545
<b>-Why didn't you say so?
-Sorry.</b>

125
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:57,633
<b>Well, Gang-hwa and I had fun
with Seo-woo today,</b>

126
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,844
<b>but he just got an urgent call</b>

127
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:02,179
<b>so he left Seo-woo with us
and left in a hurry.</b>

128
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:07,143
<b>I couldn't get in touch with Gang-hwa,
so I came here just in case.</b>

129
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:10,271
<b>It was an urgent call,
so he probably can't answer his phone.</b>

130
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:20,739
<b>Why</b>

131
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:23,742
<b>didn't you tell me sooner?</b>

132
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:28,414
<b>What's the point of telling you?</b>

133
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:31,375
<b>It would only hurt the both of us.</b>

134
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,383
<b>Weren't you hurt</b>

135
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,803
<b>when you saw me</b>

136
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:46,390
<b>living a happy life without you?</b>

137
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:51,854
<b>Were you okay with that?</b>

138
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:56,108
<b>It hurt.</b>

139
00:12:56,775 --> 00:12:57,610
<b>A lot.</b>

140
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:05,409
<b>Someone else was seeing the smile
you used to make only at me.</b>

141
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:09,330
<b>And someone else was holding
the hand that only I used to hold.</b>

142
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:14,919
<b>And someone else was in the place
I was supposed to be at.</b>

143
00:13:16,795 --> 00:13:17,838
<b>It hurt.</b>

144
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:23,802
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

145
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:27,181
<b>I'm really sorry.</b>

146
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:30,100
<b>But it hurt</b>

147
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:33,020
<b>millions of times more</b>

148
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:35,773
<b>seeing you cry alone.</b>

149
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:46,242
<b>You woke up alone,</b>

150
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:48,953
<b>watched Seo-woo alone,</b>

151
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:51,539
<b>and ate alone</b>

152
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:53,666
<b>in an empty house without me.</b>

153
00:13:56,293 --> 00:13:57,419
<b>And you</b>

154
00:13:58,712 --> 00:13:59,755
<b>cried alone.</b>

155
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,051
<b>That hurt so much</b>

156
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:07,638
<b>that I didn't even get jealous
of the other person.</b>

157
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:10,641
<b>It broke my heart,</b>

158
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:13,269
<b>but I felt so relieved.</b>

159
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:17,773
<b>I should've</b>

00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:22,945
<b>endured all that.</b>

161
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:27,908
<b>It was something I should've endured</b>

162
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:32,204
<b>even if it was agonizing.</b>

163
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,585
<b>You felt enough pain,</b>

164
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:40,754
<b>and you endured enough.</b>

165
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:44,592
<b>I can hardly breathe.</b>

166
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:46,385
<b>Why did you do this to me?</b>

167
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:52,141
<b>Bring her back. Bring her back, you jerk.</b>

168
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:02,776
<b>I only wanted one thing back then.</b>

169
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:11,535
<b>I wanted you to put me behind you
and go on with your life.</b>

170
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:16,665
<b>So don't blame yourself.</b>

171
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:05,965
<b>You really love Min-jeong.</b>

172
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:12,930
<b>I know you do.</b>

173
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:15,641
<b>Even if no one in the world can tell,</b>

174
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:17,351
<b>I know it.</b>

175
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:24,858
<b>Gang-hwa.</b>

176
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:35,369
<b>I'm not yours anymore.</b>

177
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,209
<b>You can let me go now.</b>

178
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:02,730
<b>I wonder why Gang-hwa came at this hour.</b>

179
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:06,984
<b>I don't know.</b>

180
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:10,237
<b>Yu-ri coming back to life</b>

181
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:13,991
<b>is a huge blessing for us.</b>

182
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:17,745
<b>But it might not be the case
for Gang-hwa and his wife.</b>

183
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:21,457
<b>I feel sorry for Gang-hwa's wife.</b>

184
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:28,213
<b>You don't need to feel sorry.</b>

185
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:33,761
<b>We're not asking for her place
as Seo-woo's mom or Gang-hwa's wife.</b>

186
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:39,433
<b>We're just grateful
that Yu-ri came back to us.</b>

187
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:42,603
<b>I know,</b>

188
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:48,108
<b>but if I knew this was going to happen,</b>

189
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:52,654
<b>I should've opposed when Gang-hwa
came to us asking permission</b>

190
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:55,824
<b>for him to remarry.</b>

191
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:57,701
<b>No.</b>

192
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:02,790
<b>Even if I go back to that day,
I would still tell him to remarry.</b>

193
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:06,376
<b>I can't see him suffering like that again.</b>

194
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:19,598
<b>Is that why you ran away
when you first saw me?</b>

195
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:22,893
<b>You never wanted</b>

196
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,438
<b>to appear in front of me?</b>

197
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:32,111
<b>Seo-woo's freezer incident
happened because of me.</b>

198
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:35,656
<b>How could I do that to you?</b>

199
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:39,368
<b>The freezer incident?</b>

200
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:42,204
<b>Why is that</b>

201
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:44,581
<b>your fault?</b>

202
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:52,089
<b>Didn't you hear from Hyeon-jeong?</b>

203
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:59,471
<b>Then who did you hear that from?</b>

204
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:03,642
<b>A man who said he was your friend.
He was wearing black clothes...</b>

205
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:10,023
<b>-Who are you?
-I'm here for your daughter.</b>

206
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:11,400
<b>Why?</b>

207
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:13,735
<b>Who is he?</b>

208
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:16,655
<b>Did he approach you and Seo-woo?</b>

209
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:18,073
<b>Yes.</b>

210
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:21,368
<b>Where's Seo-woo? Where is she right now?</b>

211
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:23,704
<b>At Hyeon-jeong's. Misaeng.</b>

212
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:27,374
<b>Yu-ri.</b>

213
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:29,751
<b>What is it? What's going on?</b>

214
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,135
<b>Seo-woo</b>

215
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:40,762
<b>can see ghosts.</b>

216
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:44,600
<b>What?</b>

217
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:51,315
<b>That freezer incident</b>

218
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,693
<b>happened because she followed a ghost.</b>

219
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:01,700
<b>What do you mean, Yu-ri?</b>

220
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:03,911
<b>What...</b>

221
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:08,624
<b>Why would Seo-woo see ghosts?</b>

222
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:12,836
<b>I was always by her side</b>

223
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:16,590
<b>since she was born.</b>

224
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:22,554
<b>That's why she can see ghosts.</b>

225
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:29,895
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

226
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:37,361
<b>I'm so sorry.</b>

227
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:41,448
<b>It's all my fault. I'm really sorry.</b>

228
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:47,621
<b>Seo-woo has been watching me.</b>

229
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:50,082
<b>That's why...</b>

230
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:53,293
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

231
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:56,088
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

232
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:15,565
<b>Good.</b>

233
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:30,122
<b>Gang-hwa?</b>

234
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:35,252
<b>What are you doing here?</b>

235
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:37,546
<b>I couldn't reach you,
so I came to find you.</b>

236
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:40,549
<b>Why do you look so dazed?</b>

237
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:43,135
<b>Well...</b>

238
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:45,387
<b>It's nothing.</b>

239
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:47,180
<b>It's nothing.</b>

240
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:50,934
<b>There's something going on, right?</b>

241
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:52,352
<b>What?</b>

242
00:21:58,859 --> 00:21:59,860
<b>No,</b>

243
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:01,820
<b>I'm fine.</b>

244
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:09,578
<b>You should've brought her home
if you were going to the hospital.</b>

245
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:19,880
<b>Seo-woo, come here.</b>

246
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:48,450
<b>I'm really sorry.</b>

247
00:22:48,992 --> 00:22:50,035
<b>I'm really sorry.</b>

248
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:52,996
<b>I'm sorry. It's my fault.</b>

249
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:03,507
<b>Yu-ri.</b>

250
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:09,930
<b>It's not your fault.</b>

251
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:13,433
<b>It's okay.</b>

252
00:23:15,685 --> 00:23:16,937
<b>It's okay, Yu-ri.</b>

253
00:24:49,946 --> 00:24:51,114
<b>Did Yu-ri go out again?</b>

254
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:53,825
<b>Yes. Are you going to pray again?</b>

255
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:55,952
<b>I should.</b>

256
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:59,581
<b>Mom. It seemed like
Yu-ri cried all night...</b>

257
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:02,792
<b>It's fine, you don't need to tell me.
I know.</b>

258
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:08,215
<b>I'm going.</b>

259
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:09,633
<b>Okay.</b>

260
00:25:10,383 --> 00:25:11,927
<b>Be careful.</b>

261
00:25:22,103 --> 00:25:23,355
<b>What is it?</b>

262
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:27,567
<b>Who's visiting so early in the morning?</b>

263
00:25:39,746 --> 00:25:41,581
<b>My gosh. Who is it?</b>

264
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:44,918
<b>It's you. What is it?</b>

265
00:25:45,001 --> 00:25:46,586
<b>-Where's that exorcist?
-What?</b>

266
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:50,799
<b>Where is that exorcist jerk?
I'm going to kill him! Is he in here?</b>

267
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:52,342
<b>-No.
-Come out!</b>

268
00:25:52,425 --> 00:25:54,511
<b>What's gotten into you?</b>

269
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:57,973
<b>Wait, did he actually find your daughter?</b>

270
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:02,686
<b>Oh, my goodness. He's begun now.</b>

271
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:05,563
<b>Come on, why don't you calm down first?</b>

272
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:07,524
<b>How can I calm down right now?</b>

273
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:09,025
<b>A shaman?</b>

274
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:11,361
<b>How can you do that to a six-year-old?</b>

275
00:26:11,444 --> 00:26:12,737
<b>All right, just come inside.</b>

276
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:16,116
<b>-Come inside.
-Did the deities order this, too?</b>

277
00:26:16,199 --> 00:26:17,701
<b>-My gosh.
-Did they order this?</b>

278
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,705
<b>-Did you hear that?
-Yes.</b>

279
00:26:22,372 --> 00:26:24,207
<b>The exorcist must be after
Yu-ri's daughter.</b>

280
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:28,044
<b>He's such a cold monster.</b>

281
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:30,755
<b>So make sure to avoid him at all costs.</b>

282
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:32,007
<b>One mistake,</b>

283
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:34,884
<b>and we'd get sent up before
we get to see Pil-seung get married.</b>

284
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:37,053
<b>No way. No.</b>

285
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:39,597
<b>-That can't ever happen.
-Let's go.</b>

286
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:41,474
<b>Yes, let's go.</b>

287
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:49,524
<b>Are you just going to stand there
huffing like that?</b>

288
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:51,318
<b>What choice do I have?</b>

289
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:53,903
<b>There's nothing I can do right now.</b>

290
00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:54,904
<b>What?</b>

291
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:58,408
<b>What should I do?</b>

292
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:01,411
<b>I was thinking of going up
when Seo-woo became normal.</b>

293
00:27:01,661 --> 00:27:03,371
<b>But she can still see them,</b>

294
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:05,290
<b>and now there's a weird exorcist
after her.</b>

295
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:08,293
<b>But there's nothing I can do.</b>

296
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:13,506
<b>There is something you can do.</b>

297
00:27:14,674 --> 00:27:15,508
<b>Like what?</b>

298
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:18,470
<b>Your daughter can stop seeing ghosts.</b>

299
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:20,055
<b>Don't worry.</b>

300
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:21,890
<b>You can trust me on that.</b>

301
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:25,602
<b>-Are you sure?
-Yes, I'm sure of it.</b>

302
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:29,397
<b>So you should focus on your job
and what you want to do.</b>

303
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:31,483
<b>What do you mean?</b>

304
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:34,944
<b>You're going to leave soon.
There are only a few days left.</b>

305
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:37,530
<b>Will you just waste your time
and leave this world?</b>

306
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:40,033
<b>Is there anything you want to do?</b>

307
00:28:02,972 --> 00:28:05,642
<b>Whatever the reason may be,
this is a rare chance.</b>

308
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:09,145
<b>You don't have enough time to do
everything you want.</b>

309
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:13,066
<b>Since you made up your mind
to leave this world,</b>

310
00:28:13,316 --> 00:28:14,984
<b>do everything you want to do
before you go.</b>

311
00:28:15,568 --> 00:28:16,611
<b>But that exorcist keeps--</b>

312
00:28:16,694 --> 00:28:20,156
<b>Goodness, didn't I tell you?
I told you Guk-bong would be back again.</b>

313
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,242
<b>But why does he keep showing up?</b>

314
00:28:22,325 --> 00:28:24,494
<b>To confirm
that your daughter can see ghosts.</b>

315
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:26,955
<b>And once he confirms it,
we can't undo this.</b>

316
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:29,833
<b>There are fewer people
who can see ghosts these days,</b>

317
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:31,751
<b>so he's not going to lose even one.</b>

318
00:28:32,585 --> 00:28:34,629
<b>But you're completely against it.</b>

319
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:36,172
<b>You bet I am.</b>

320
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:37,215
<b>Exactly.</b>

321
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:38,925
<b>Just focus on protecting your daughter</b>

322
00:28:39,008 --> 00:28:40,760
<b>and hang in there
for the remaining time here.</b>

323
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:42,637
<b>Enjoy your time here until you go.</b>

324
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:44,639
<b>What happens once I leave here?</b>

325
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:46,182
<b>What will happen to Seo-woo?</b>

326
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:48,017
<b>Don't worry.</b>

327
00:28:48,601 --> 00:28:50,061
<b>Your daughter can stop seeing ghosts.</b>

328
00:28:50,645 --> 00:28:51,688
<b>Just trust me.</b>

329
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:55,275
<b>Yu-ri.</b>

330
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:58,570
<b>Mom.</b>

331
00:28:58,653 --> 00:29:00,113
<b>Why are you here?</b>

332
00:29:01,614 --> 00:29:02,574
<b>I...</b>

333
00:29:03,366 --> 00:29:06,453
<b>She's not crying.
She's just roaming around everywhere.</b>

334
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:11,416
<b>Roaming around?
My daughter? In this world?</b>

335
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:13,626
<b>No, I didn't mean it. It's...</b>

336
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:19,424
<b>Mom, are you here to pray?</b>

337
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:21,926
<b>Yes.</b>

338
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:23,762
<b>Why are you here?</b>

339
00:29:24,637 --> 00:29:26,890
<b>I just had to take care of something.</b>

340
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:28,475
<b>Let's go, Mom.</b>

341
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:30,393
<b>I was just about to leave, too.</b>

342
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:32,103
<b>Okay.</b>

343
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:42,572
<b>I feel like a sinner
because I slipped just once.</b>

344
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:49,204
<b>Once she leaves,</b>

345
00:29:50,705 --> 00:29:52,332
<b>how is her mom going to deal with that?</b>

346
00:29:52,832 --> 00:29:55,418
<b>Your friend? That shaman is your friend?</b>

347
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:56,544
<b>Yes.</b>

348
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:02,884
<b>She looks way older than you.
How is she your friend?</b>

349
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:05,678
<b>Age doesn't matter in friendship.</b>

350
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:07,764
<b>She's nice despite her looks.</b>

351
00:30:09,557 --> 00:30:11,684
<b>Did you really come here to meet her?</b>

352
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,561
<b>Yes.</b>

353
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:16,022
<b>Mom, what about you?</b>

354
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:20,902
<b>Why do you think?
I came here to offer my prayer.</b>

355
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:24,697
<b>I thanked him
for sending back my daughter.</b>

356
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:28,993
<b>What if he takes you away because
I stop coming to pay my respect?</b>

357
00:30:38,461 --> 00:30:39,462
<b>Mom,</b>

358
00:30:40,213 --> 00:30:41,965
<b>is there anything you want to do with me?</b>

359
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:43,258
<b>With you?</b>

360
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:46,261
<b>Things you regret not doing with me.</b>

361
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:50,181
<b>I am</b>

362
00:30:51,474 --> 00:30:55,937
<b>just happy to be with you.
I don't want anything else.</b>

363
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:11,786
<b>You already got her ready?</b>

364
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:14,080
<b>Yes. I'll drop her off
at the kindergarten.</b>

365
00:31:15,498 --> 00:31:18,084
<b>Gang-hwa, what's gotten into you
yesterday and today?</b>

366
00:31:18,167 --> 00:31:20,128
<b>What? What do you mean?</b>

367
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:22,213
<b>You're practically glued to her.
You won't leave her.</b>

368
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:35,393
<b>-Where are you going?
-To pee.</b>

369
00:31:36,102 --> 00:31:37,478
<b>To pee? Let's go.</b>

370
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:44,485
<b>Seo-woo, where are you going?</b>

371
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:05,590
<b>You've been following her
around the whole day.</b>

372
00:32:07,133 --> 00:32:08,468
<b>-Really?
-Yes.</b>

373
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:17,435
<b>Right. We talked about Seo-woo's
pick-up helper yesterday.</b>

374
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:19,520
<b>What?</b>

375
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:21,522
<b>-Min-jeong.
-Yes?</b>

376
00:32:23,566 --> 00:32:24,651
<b>Let's</b>

377
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:29,697
<b>get a new pick-up helper.</b>

378
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:33,326
<b>Tell me why you want a new pick-up helper.</b>

379
00:32:38,414 --> 00:32:39,916
<b>If you don't tell me, I won't do it.</b>

380
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:48,841
<b>There's a room
somewhere in Gang-hwa's heart.</b>

381
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:51,928
<b>It's a room I should never open up</b>

382
00:32:53,096 --> 00:32:55,723
<b>even if everyone
in the world opens up to look at it.</b>

383
00:32:58,142 --> 00:32:59,519
<b>And that was really tough.</b>

384
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:30,425
<b>You don't have to tell me now,</b>

385
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:34,303
<b>but tell me when you are ready to tell me.</b>

386
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:39,183
<b>Can you come to the hospital
later in the afternoon today?</b>

387
00:33:44,772 --> 00:33:47,734
<b>I'll tell you everything
why we need a new helper.</b>

388
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:54,741
<b>You're going to leave soon.</b>

389
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:56,743
<b>There are only a few days left.</b>

390
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:58,953
<b>Will you just waste your time
and leave this world?</b>

391
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:00,455
<b>Is there anything you want to do?</b>

392
00:34:07,128 --> 00:34:08,212
<b>What was that?</b>

393
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:10,923
<b>Hey, you know that dumb friend of yours?</b>

394
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:13,593
<b>What's his name? Bin or Bong?
Anyway, he's following your friend.</b>

395
00:34:13,676 --> 00:34:14,761
<b>My dumb friend?</b>

396
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:16,012
<b>Geun-sang?</b>

397
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:22,602
<b>Yu-ri.</b>

398
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,146
<b>Are you okay?</b>

399
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:29,567
<b>I heard everything.
How did you go through all that?</b>

400
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,653
<b>It's all right.</b>

401
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:36,199
<b>Everything will be okay now.</b>

402
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:40,912
<b>-Geun-sang.
-Tell me.</b>

403
00:34:41,954 --> 00:34:43,748
<b>Tell me everything. I'm all ears.</b>

404
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:47,376
<b>What have you been up to?
Why is a ghost following you?</b>

405
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:50,129
<b>What are you saying?</b>

406
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:52,215
<b>Don't make jokes about that.</b>

407
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:54,300
<b>And you of all people shouldn't.</b>

408
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:56,677
<b>What's wrong with you?</b>

409
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:58,179
<b>No, that's not true.</b>

410
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,349
<b>Why are you making things creepy
this morning?</b>

411
00:35:01,724 --> 00:35:03,392
<b>Where? Where is it?</b>

412
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:05,520
<b>-Goodness.
-Where?</b>

413
00:35:07,563 --> 00:35:09,690
<b>Yu-ri. Where are you going? Don't go!</b>

414
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:11,651
<b>Tell me about it before you go!</b>

415
00:35:14,028 --> 00:35:16,531
<b>I'm scared. I'm...</b>

416
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:20,576
<b>You give me peace like a river</b>

417
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:23,579
<b>You give me peace like a river</b>

418
00:35:23,746 --> 00:35:25,414
<b>Hallelujah</b>

419
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:28,459
<b>You give me peace like a river</b>

420
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:30,586
<b>You give me peace like a river</b>

421
00:35:45,017 --> 00:35:46,727
<b>-Hello.
-Hello.</b>

422
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:54,110
<b>I'm right about this.
It's all over the town.</b>

423
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:57,113
<b>Those two were crying like crazy
at the playground.</b>

424
00:35:57,196 --> 00:36:00,032
<b>Are you sure it was Seo-woo's dad
and the kitchen assistant?</b>

425
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:01,868
<b>-Yes.
-She said they were.</b>

426
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:05,913
<b>But she has no idea.
They are hanging out like besties. Gosh.</b>

427
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:10,877
<b>Hi, you're here.</b>

428
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:12,628
<b>Hello, Seo-woo.</b>

429
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:15,256
<b>-All right. Take off your shoes.
-Take off your shoes.</b>

430
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:20,136
<b>Let's take off your shoes and go inside.
Let's go.</b>

431
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:22,972
<b>Say bye to your dad.</b>

432
00:36:23,055 --> 00:36:24,098
<b>Seo-woo.</b>

433
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:29,645
<b>-Oh, right.
-Okay.</b>

434
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:31,606
<b>Bye.</b>

435
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:33,065
<b>Let's go.</b>

436
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:05,264
<b>He's not okay at all.</b>

437
00:37:14,523 --> 00:37:15,399
<b>Are you okay?</b>

438
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:18,986
<b>I mean, she should</b>

439
00:37:19,862 --> 00:37:22,031
<b>have told you
she watched you for five years.</b>

440
00:37:22,698 --> 00:37:25,868
<b>No. How could she tell you that? Goodness.</b>

441
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:29,288
<b>Have you ever felt this?</b>

442
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:31,123
<b>You did something awful</b>

443
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:33,626
<b>that you didn't want this person</b>

444
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:35,419
<b>to find out.</b>

445
00:37:36,003 --> 00:37:37,004
<b>But it turned out that</b>

446
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:40,841
<b>this person
had been watching the whole time.</b>

447
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:42,635
<b>That's how it feels.</b>

448
00:37:42,718 --> 00:37:43,844
<b>I know.</b>

449
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:45,888
<b>It feels naked.</b>

450
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:50,434
<b>Hey, but what you did wasn't awful.</b>

451
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:53,312
<b>Is remarrying a bad thing?
Why is that awful?</b>

452
00:37:55,064 --> 00:37:56,649
<b>She saw everything.</b>

453
00:37:56,899 --> 00:37:58,192
<b>Did you know that she was?</b>

454
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:00,069
<b>Did you know
she'd stay with you as a ghost?</b>

455
00:38:00,152 --> 00:38:01,696
<b>Did you know she'd come back?</b>

456
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:03,072
<b>Don't blame yourself.</b>

457
00:38:03,155 --> 00:38:05,241
<b>Yu-ri said this is why
she didn't tell you.</b>

458
00:38:09,745 --> 00:38:12,039
<b>Gang-hwa, Doctor Jang is looking for you.</b>

459
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:22,091
<b>Observe my surgery starting this week.</b>

460
00:38:22,174 --> 00:38:23,092
<b>Pardon?</b>

461
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:27,972
<b>When I do my surgery,
come into the operating room</b>

462
00:38:28,347 --> 00:38:29,181
<b>and watch.</b>

463
00:38:32,351 --> 00:38:34,020
<b>I think we did enough for counseling.</b>

464
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:36,772
<b>We should get you exposed
to the surroundings to overcome this.</b>

465
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:40,109
<b>I'm not confident
that I can handle the exposure.</b>

466
00:38:40,192 --> 00:38:41,444
<b>Bye.</b>

467
00:38:41,527 --> 00:38:43,029
<b>-Hey. You.
-Doctor Cho.</b>

468

<b>-Hey!

469
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:49,243
<b>-What should we do?
-What do you think?</b>

470
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:52,621
<b>He'll have to do it.
What other choice does he have?</b>

471
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:54,665
<b>Will he get fired?</b>

472
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:09,263
<b>Gang-hwa,</b>

473
00:39:10,097 --> 00:39:12,641
<b>you can let me go now.</b>

474
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:26,155
<b>Those mothers can't
even look me in the eye now.</b>

475
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:30,034
<b>I guess we were pretty scary that day.
They can't say anything to me now.</b>

476
00:39:32,161 --> 00:39:33,996
<b>Thanks to you,</b>

477
00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:37,875
<b>living in this town
became a little easier.</b>

478
00:39:40,252 --> 00:39:41,504
<b>I'm glad.</b>

479
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:44,548
<b>They can't say anything about Seo-woo now.</b>

480
00:39:45,424 --> 00:39:47,676
<b>Come to think of it,
did I hit them too hard?</b>

481
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,720
<b>My gosh. That shouldn't
even count as hitting.</b>

482
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:51,180
<b>You know what?</b>

483
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:55,559
<b>You must think this is
some kind of a cafe for moms.</b>

484
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:59,772
<b>This is my place of business.
My sacred place of business.</b>

485
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:05,694
<b>Hyeon-jeong!</b>

486
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:07,488
<b>I'm so just thirsty.</b>

487
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:14,036
<b>That hit the spot.</b>

488
00:40:16,038 --> 00:40:18,499
<b>Why are you chopping so many green onions?</b>

489
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:21,377
<b>My gosh, it's so spicy. My eyes sting.</b>

490
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:34,098
<b>Hyeon-jeong.</b>

491
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,185
<b>I was just passing by.</b>

492
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:41,272
<b>Have some coffee.</b>

493
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:43,524
<b>-Okay.
-My gosh.</b>

494
00:40:44,233 --> 00:40:45,860
<b>You have a lot of dishes to wash.</b>

495
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:47,278
<b>It's nothing.</b>

496
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:54,952
<b>Hyeon-jeong!
The weather is warming up now.</b>

497
00:40:56,078 --> 00:40:57,913
<b>Those are some huge anchovies! Oh, my.</b>

498
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:03,627
<b>These are some good anchovies.
Are they from Tongyeong?</b>

499
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:13,220
<b>Hyeon-jeong.</b>

500
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:14,972
<b>And Do-yoen.</b>

501
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:18,976
<b>This isn't a place you stop by
when you feel like it. What is this place?</b>

502
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:21,270
<b>A place of business.</b>

503
00:41:22,563 --> 00:41:23,522
<b>I love it.</b>

504
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:26,942
<b>Having a place I can stop by
in my neighborhood.</b>

505
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:31,447
<b>I didn't have any place I could stop by
in this neighborhood.</b>

506
00:41:33,282 --> 00:41:35,367
<b>This feels like a hideout.</b>

507
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:42,875
<b>I have an appointment. I'll get going.</b>

508
00:41:42,958 --> 00:41:43,792
<b>Okay.</b>

509
00:41:43,876 --> 00:41:45,544
<b>Seo-woo doesn't have
private lessons today.</b>

510
00:41:45,628 --> 00:41:47,713
<b>Play with her at home
or at the playground.</b>

511
00:41:48,964 --> 00:41:49,965
<b>Seo-woo.</b>

512
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:52,009
<b>Mom!</b>

513
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:57,431
<b>I'm leaving now. Play with the aunt
and I'll see you at home.</b>

514
00:41:57,556 --> 00:41:59,683
<b>Okay? Bye, Ha-jun.</b>

515
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:00,851
<b>Bye.</b>

516
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:02,061
<b>Goodness.</b>

517
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:05,940
<b>Good girl.</b>

518
00:42:11,612 --> 00:42:12,780
<b>Go play.</b>

519
00:42:14,323 --> 00:42:15,407
<b>Bye.</b>

520
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:17,034
<b>Bye, Min-jeong.</b>

521
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:23,791
<b>Well,</b>

522
00:42:25,459 --> 00:42:28,045
<b>we are friends, right?</b>

523
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:33,884
<b>Seeing how close we are,</b>

524
00:42:34,134 --> 00:42:37,179
<b>I was wondering
if I could call you guys friends.</b>

525
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:45,604
<b>Of course. We are best friends.</b>

526
00:42:45,688 --> 00:42:46,855
<b>You bet.</b>

527
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:23,142
<b>Hello.</b>

528
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:24,351
<b>Hi.</b>

529
00:43:24,893 --> 00:43:27,563
<b>We have a lot of beautiful
accessories today. Look around.</b>

530
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:33,319
<b>FRIENDSHIP BRACELET,
SHARE YOUR MEMORIES</b>

531
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:35,654
<b>Give me three of those.</b>

532
00:43:36,655 --> 00:43:38,741
<b>Are you giving them to your friends?</b>

533
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:39,992
<b>Yes.</b>

534
00:43:40,909 --> 00:43:42,745
<b>-How much are they?
-50,000 won.</b>

535
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:50,044
<b>-Here you go.
-Sell a lot.</b>

536
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:51,920
<b>-Wear them well.
-Okay.</b>

537
00:44:04,975 --> 00:44:06,268
<b>It's all my fault.</b>

538
00:44:08,103 --> 00:44:11,523
<b>My gosh, what's wrong with you?
Why is this your fault?</b>

539
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:14,109
<b>If I didn't</b>

540
00:44:15,611 --> 00:44:17,488
<b>encourage Gang-hwa</b>

541
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:20,824
<b>to date Min-jeong back then...</b>

542
00:44:22,368 --> 00:44:23,202
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

543
00:44:23,285 --> 00:44:25,120
<b>Why would you say that?</b>

544
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:28,165
<b>I was really thankful to you
when you did that.</b>

545
00:44:29,583 --> 00:44:31,335
<b>There must be a way.</b>

546
00:44:31,418 --> 00:44:34,171
<b>I told the shaman to find us a way.</b>

547
00:44:34,797 --> 00:44:36,965
<b>I'm trying to wrap my head around it,</b>

548
00:44:39,468 --> 00:44:41,053
<b>but I cannot have you leave me again.</b>

549
00:44:45,432 --> 00:44:46,475
<b>Hyeon-jeong.</b>

550
00:44:47,059 --> 00:44:47,893
<b>Yes?</b>

551
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:52,314
<b>Everyone is having a hard time
because I came back.</b>

552
00:44:53,982 --> 00:44:56,026
<b>I didn't come back to make people suffer.</b>

553
00:44:56,944 --> 00:44:59,363
<b>Because of me, Gang-hwa and you</b>

554
00:45:00,656 --> 00:45:02,157
<b>are such in pain.</b>

555
00:45:04,326 --> 00:45:07,704
<b>I should have hidden from you guys
and never gotten caught.</b>

556
00:45:09,706 --> 00:45:11,458
<b>This is not why I came back at all.</b>

557
00:45:14,503 --> 00:45:16,088
<b>I shouldn't have gotten caught.</b>

558
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:19,216
<b>I shouldn't have.</b>

559
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:27,724
<b>What is it?
Do you have something to tell me?</b>

560
00:45:27,808 --> 00:45:32,146
<b>To be honest, I like you.</b>

561
00:45:32,688 --> 00:45:33,856
<b>You're cool.</b>

562
00:45:33,939 --> 00:45:35,232
<b>So what?</b>

563
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:41,530
<b>That's why
I really wanted to tell you this.</b>

564
00:45:45,367 --> 00:45:47,619
<b>You should change your pick-up helper.</b>

565
00:45:47,703 --> 00:45:48,704
<b>What?</b>

566
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:53,876
<b>Why? Why must I do that?</b>

567
00:45:55,502 --> 00:45:57,379
<b>Everyone is talking about it now.</b>

568
00:45:57,463 --> 00:45:59,965
<b>People are saying
your pick-up helper and your husband</b>

569
00:46:00,924 --> 00:46:02,217
<b>are having an affair.</b>

570
00:46:05,053 --> 00:46:06,680
<b>Now, you're spreading groundless rumors?</b>

571
00:46:07,473 --> 00:46:08,807
<b>Are we done here?</b>

572
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:13,103
<b>No, people said that they were
crying at the playground together.</b>

573
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:15,397
<b>It's true.</b>

574
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:19,193
<b>Please go.</b>

575
00:46:21,778 --> 00:46:23,197
<b>Goodness.</b>

576
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,365
<b>All right. Let's do it one more time.</b>

577
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:28,535
<b>All right. Here. Goodness.</b>

578
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:30,370
<b>-Harder?
-Yes, harder!</b>

579
00:46:30,537 --> 00:46:33,582
<b>My gosh, look. I caught it. I got it.</b>

580
00:46:34,082 --> 00:46:36,210
<b>All right. Let's do it again.</b>

581
00:46:36,293 --> 00:46:38,504
<b>Again. Let's do it again.</b>

582
00:46:39,671 --> 00:46:40,589
<b>Goodness.</b>

583
00:46:41,423 --> 00:46:42,508
<b>One more time. Throw it far.</b>

584
00:46:42,591 --> 00:46:45,677
<b>-Dad, you must be tired. That's enough.
-That's nonsense.</b>

585
00:46:46,011 --> 00:46:48,764
<b>I'm still going strong. Right, Seo-woo?</b>

586
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:51,725
<b>Grandpa can play with you
for 12 more hours.</b>

587
00:46:51,808 --> 00:46:53,435
<b>All right. One more time!</b>

588
00:46:54,728 --> 00:46:56,647
<b>-All right. Gosh.
-He's unstoppable.</b>

589
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:58,357
<b>Goodness.</b>

590
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:00,692
<b>Give me a few minutes.
I'll go and buy some cool drinks.</b>

591
00:47:01,193 --> 00:47:02,611
<b>Sounds great. All right.</b>

592
00:47:02,736 --> 00:47:05,113
<b>You got it. You caught it, Seo-woo.</b>

593
00:47:06,156 --> 00:47:09,243
<b>All right. Look. Grandpa caught it too.</b>

594
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:17,709
<b>Seo-woo, do you want to sit down
and rest for a bit? Okay.</b>

595
00:47:18,544 --> 00:47:21,046
<b>All right. Let's put this here.</b>

596
00:47:21,922 --> 00:47:22,881
<b>Goodness.</b>

597
00:47:23,882 --> 00:47:25,008
<b>Gosh.</b>

598
00:47:25,634 --> 00:47:28,095
<b>Where did you get your beautiful looks?</b>

599
00:47:28,178 --> 00:47:33,559
<b>You have pretty eyes, nose, and cheeks.</b>

600
00:47:34,059 --> 00:47:36,562
<b>And even your hands are pretty.
Look at them wriggle.</b>

601
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:38,814
<b>My goodness.</b>

602
00:47:39,731 --> 00:47:41,650
<b>Oh, no. Goodness.</b>

603
00:47:41,733 --> 00:47:43,652
<b>My gosh. Oh, no.</b>

604
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:47,447
<b>-Are you okay? Oh, goodness.
-Yes.</b>

605
00:47:48,448 --> 00:47:50,534
<b>Seo-woo, don't go anywhere. Stay there.</b>

606
00:47:51,577 --> 00:47:53,036
<b>-Gosh.
-Oh, no.</b>

607
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:03,672
<b>I know, right?</b>

608
00:48:03,755 --> 00:48:05,215
<b>-Sure.
-What should we play?</b>

609
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:06,508
<b>Let's play with Mimi.</b>

610
00:48:07,092 --> 00:48:08,051
<b>-Sure. I like that.
-Mom.</b>

611
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:10,804
<b>Mom said she'd cook tteokbokki for us.</b>

612
00:48:17,185 --> 00:48:18,812
<b>-Here.
-Okay.</b>

613
00:48:19,855 --> 00:48:21,106
<b>You should be careful.</b>

614
00:48:21,189 --> 00:48:22,858
<b>-Thank you.
-Sure.</b>

615

<b>Dad.</b>

<b>I shouldn't have come. I'm so sorry.</b>

783
01:00:41,137 --> 01:00:42,597
<b>What do you mean?</b>

784
01:00:43,931 --> 01:00:47,143
<b>Yu-ri, it's not your fault.
It's all right.</b>

785
01:00:49,646 --> 01:00:52,774
<b>Why do you always say
everything is all right?</b>

786
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:57,028
<b>It's not all right at all.
You aren't all right.</b>

787
01:01:07,372 --> 01:01:08,581
<b>Yu-ri.</b>

788
01:01:30,895 --> 01:01:32,522
<b>I shouldn't have come back to life.</b>

789
01:01:33,022 --> 01:01:35,024
<b>It's not like you wanted to.</b>

790
01:01:35,108 --> 01:01:37,652
<b>And you didn't get caught
because you wanted to.</b>

791
01:01:38,486 --> 01:01:40,863
<b>Everyone cries, worries,</b>

792
01:01:40,947 --> 01:01:42,782
<b>and sighs when they see me.</b>

793
01:01:46,285 --> 01:01:47,954
<b>No one smiles.</b>

794
01:01:49,122 --> 01:01:50,832
<b>Everyone is tormented because of me.</b>

795
01:01:52,750 --> 01:01:55,044
<b>Everyone who's alive is like that.</b>

796
01:01:55,128 --> 01:01:57,880
<b>They think more about tomorrow than today.</b>

797
01:01:58,756 --> 01:02:03,261
<b>That's why they have a lot of troubles,
sigh a lot, and regret a lot too.</b>

798
01:02:05,304 --> 01:02:07,306
<b>If they thought they'd live
just another day</b>

799
01:02:07,765 --> 01:02:09,517
<b>like you or other ghosts here,</b>

800
01:02:10,059 --> 01:02:11,853
<b>there's no need to worry about everything.</b>

801
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:20,903
<b>Goodness.</b>

802
01:02:23,990 --> 01:02:25,491
<b>Ms. Mi-dong...</b>

803
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:30,121
<b>Yu-ri! You're here. You came.</b>

804
01:02:30,204 --> 01:02:32,081
<b>When did you get here? When?</b>

805
01:02:32,665 --> 01:02:35,585
<b>Yes, Yu-ri came. Our dear Yu-ri.</b>

806
01:02:36,419 --> 01:02:38,588
<b>I thought you were sick of this place.
Why did you come?</b>

807
01:02:38,671 --> 01:02:40,423
<b>This is my home too.</b>

808
01:02:40,506 --> 01:02:41,841
<b>I'm glad you're here. I'm glad.</b>

809
01:02:41,924 --> 01:02:44,135
<b>-I'm so glad.
-I missed you.</b>

810
01:02:44,218 --> 01:02:45,720
<b>I'm glad you're here.</b>

811
01:02:55,938 --> 01:02:58,900
<b>Why do you always say
everything is all right?</b>

812
01:03:00,318 --> 01:03:03,279
<b>It's not all right at all.
You aren't all right.</b>

813
01:03:36,938 --> 01:03:38,397
<b>You must've been shocked.</b>

814
01:04:00,628 --> 01:04:01,629
<b>Min-jeong.</b>

815
01:04:03,464 --> 01:04:05,383
<b>Why are you crying? Don't cry.</b>

816
01:04:06,050 --> 01:04:08,219
<b>It wasn't your fault, okay?</b>

817
01:04:10,847 --> 01:04:12,682
<b>Then whose fault is this?</b>

818
01:04:15,309 --> 01:04:17,436
<b>Is it because you're at the hospital
all day long?</b>

819
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:24,735
<b>I hired a pick-up helper
to return to work, then lost my child.</b>

820
01:04:27,029 --> 01:04:28,239
<b>And Seo-woo</b>

821
01:04:30,741 --> 01:04:34,161
<b>is slower and grayer than most children.</b>

822
01:04:35,997 --> 01:04:38,416
<b>If all of those aren't my fault,
whose fault is it?</b>

823
01:04:40,668 --> 01:04:41,711
<b>Am I not her mother?</b>

824
01:04:41,794 --> 01:04:42,962
<b>Min-jeong.</b>

825
01:04:44,046 --> 01:04:48,676
<b>When something is wrong with a kid,
everyone blames the mother.</b>

826
01:04:49,886 --> 01:04:52,305
<b>Why do you always say it's not my fault?</b>

827
01:04:53,806 --> 01:04:55,641
<b>You said I'm Seo-woo's mother.</b>

828
01:04:58,394 --> 01:05:00,563
<b>Am I really her mother?</b>

829
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:07,528
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

830
01:05:09,113 --> 01:05:10,156
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

831
01:05:13,993 --> 01:05:15,494
<b>Why are you always</b>

832
01:05:17,538 --> 01:05:18,789
<b>sorry</b>

833
01:05:21,208 --> 01:05:22,543
<b>and fine?</b>

834
01:05:45,232 --> 01:05:46,609
<b>Cha Yu-ri.</b>

835
01:05:50,154 --> 01:05:52,823
<b>Those three syllables
are taboo words to me.</b>

836
01:05:55,618 --> 01:05:56,994
<b>How long</b>

837
01:05:58,204 --> 01:06:00,831
<b>will you keep that door shut to me?</b>

838
01:06:01,916 --> 01:06:04,210
<b>How long will you
keep that door locked up?</b>

839
01:06:06,045 --> 01:06:08,839
<b>You have to open that door
for me to go in.</b>

840
01:06:10,925 --> 01:06:14,595
<b>That's the only way
I can truly be Seo-woo's mom.</b>

841
01:06:38,911 --> 01:06:40,204
<b>The pick-up helper.</b>

842
01:06:46,961 --> 01:06:48,129
<b>That's her.</b>

843
01:06:49,005 --> 01:06:49,922
<b>Yu-ri.</b>

844
01:06:51,841 --> 01:06:52,675
<b>Cha Yu-ri.</b>

845
01:07:07,023 --> 01:07:07,982
<b>What</b>

846
01:07:10,109 --> 01:07:11,152
<b>do you...</b>

847
01:07:13,529 --> 01:07:15,031
<b>What do you mean?</b>

848
01:07:21,245 --> 01:07:22,705
<b>Seo-woo's biological mother.</b>

849

<b>Cha Yu-ri.</b>

850
01:07:29,837 --> 01:07:31,213
<b>She came back to life.</b>

851
01:07:55,613 --> 01:07:58,866
<b>Why? You can't seem to sleep?</b>

852
01:08:01,202 --> 01:08:03,954
<b>I don't want to waste my time sleeping.</b>

853
01:08:05,998 --> 01:08:08,709
<b>Mom, can you sing for me?</b>

854
01:08:09,502 --> 01:08:11,295
<b>What? Which song?</b>

855
01:08:14,048 --> 01:08:15,132
<b>"Pine Tree."</b>

856
01:08:16,342 --> 01:08:17,384
<b>"Pine Tree?"</b>

857
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:19,178
<b>You remember that?</b>

858
01:08:19,428 --> 01:08:21,597
<b>I used to sing it for you
when you were a baby.</b>

859
01:08:21,847 --> 01:08:25,101
<b>It has been so long,
so I want to listen to it. Please do sing.</b>

860
01:08:30,856 --> 01:08:36,195
<b>Pine tree, pine tree</b>

861
01:08:36,654 --> 01:08:41,826
<b>Your light is evergreen</b>

862
01:08:42,284 --> 01:08:47,164
<b>On a lonely autumn day</b>

863

<b>You are evergreen</b>

872
01:09:39,884 --> 01:09:42,887
<b>Anyway, we established the hierarchy
in this chaotic neighborhood.</b>

873
01:09:43,095 --> 01:09:45,097
<b>That means we're the bosses, right?</b>

874
01:09:45,639 --> 01:09:47,766
<b>This is exactly why
we should be careful around kids.</b>

875
01:09:47,850 --> 01:09:48,934
<b>You already learned.</b>

876
01:09:49,268 --> 01:09:51,812
<b>Exactly, she learns very fast.</b>

877
01:09:51,896 --> 01:09:53,314
<b>She called us bosses.</b>

878
01:09:53,856 --> 01:09:56,817
<b>Don't laugh like that
when older ladies are talking.</b>

879
01:09:56,984 --> 01:09:58,986
<b>She should lie down head-first

880
01:09:59,069 --> 01:10:01,864
<b>You can't do that nowadays.
You'll get handcuffed.</b>

881

<b>This world is coming to an end.
Let's go out and get some eggs.</b>

<b>Okay.</b>

883
01:10:10,706 --> 01:10:14,376
<b>Goodness, she won't even stand up

<b>-Keep the restaurant safe, will you?
-Yes.</b>

885

<b>I couldn't see

888
01:11:40,546 --> 01:11:42,172
<b>It must've been fun</b>

889
01:11:42,256 --> 01:11:46,385
<b>to see how much I loved her
