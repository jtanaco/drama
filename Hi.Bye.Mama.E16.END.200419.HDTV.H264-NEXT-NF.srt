42
00:02:56,419 --> 00:02:57,753
<b>I wanted to</b>

79

87
00:07:12,049 --> 00:07:14,677

00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:34,306
<b>Yes.</b>

164
00:13:38,518 --> 00:13:41,271
<b>My daughter who entered school</b>

165
00:13:41,355 --> 00:13:43,732
<b>with a bag that was
almost as big as herself.</b>

166
00:13:47,736 --> 00:13:49,071
<b>My teenage daughter</b>

167
00:13:49,154 --> 00:13:52,574
<b>who would giggle
over rolling leaves on the street.</b>

168
00:13:54,076 --> 00:13:56,244
<b>My daughter who wept sadly</b>

169
00:13:56,328 --> 00:13:58,872
<b>as if her life was over
when she failed the college exam.</b>

170

<b>If this room was gone,</b>

171
00:14:08,882 --> 00:14:12,260
<b>it would've felt like
you weren't even here to begin with.</b>

172
00:14:15,514 --> 00:14:17,015
<b>So I couldn't get rid of your stuff.</b>

173
00:14:34,866 --> 00:14:35,993
<b>It's okay</b>

174
00:14:36,535 --> 00:14:38,787
<b>even if I'm not in this world.</b>

175

<b>I'm living in your heart all the time</b>

176
00:14:47,129 --> 00:14:48,338
<b>That's all that matters.</b>

177
00:14:55,053 --> 00:14:56,054
<b>You're right.</b>

178
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:01,184
<b>It's okay as long as you live in my heart.</b>

179
00:15:59,493 --> 00:16:00,452
<b>What's wrong?</b>

180
00:16:02,245 --> 00:16:03,205
<b>What?</b>

181
00:16:03,997 --> 00:16:04,873
<b>Why?</b>

182
00:16:04,956 --> 00:16:06,625
<b>What are you thinking about?</b>

183
00:16:09,461 --> 00:16:11,171
<b>Nothing.</b>

184
00:16:12,964 --> 00:16:15,801
<b>Did you have the dream again last night?</b>

185
00:16:21,807 --> 00:16:22,808
<b>Yes.</b>

186
00:17:12,607 --> 00:17:14,151
<b>I still think it's not right.</b>

187
00:17:14,484 --> 00:17:16,444
<b>There must be a way. I'll find it.</b>

188
00:17:17,779 --> 00:17:18,864
<b>There is no way.</b>

189
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:21,449

192

<b>She</b>

00:17:31,835 --> 00:17:33,128
<b>almost died then.</b>

194
00:17:33,378 --> 00:17:36,298
<b>This isn't just about being scared

<b>I've been dead already.</b>

196

<b>Being alive like this</b>

197
00:17:49,394 --> 00:17:51,146
<b>is the weird part.</b>

00:17:54,316 --> 00:17:55,358
<b>Yu-ri.</b>

199
00:17:56,568 --> 00:18:00,447
<b>Anyway, you can live. Try to live.
You should do something, Yu-ri.</b>

200
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:02,407
<b>Since you already died once, should I say,</b>

201
00:18:02,532 --> 00:18:04,701
<b>"Okay. Bye.
You've been dead already anyway"?</b>

202
00:18:04,784 --> 00:18:05,660
<b>Does that make sense?</b>

203
00:18:06,536 --> 00:18:07,454
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

204
00:18:17,255 --> 00:18:18,298
<b>Yu-ri.</b>

205
00:18:35,148 --> 00:18:37,067
<b>What is this?</b>

206
00:18:39,152 --> 00:18:40,362
<b>Your mom's wish.</b>

207
00:18:41,571 --> 00:18:43,114
<b>The reason why you came back to life.</b>

210
00:18:56,795 --> 00:18:58,129
<b>Is this why I came to life?</b>

211
00:18:59,756 --> 00:19:00,757
<b>Yes.</b>

<b>I WANT TO SEE MY DAUGHTER ONCE MORE...</b>

214

<b><i>I thought she was praying

218

<b>So this is it.</b>

219
00:20:06,531 --> 00:20:07,824
<b>I had no idea.</b>

220
00:20:09,284 --> 00:20:10,744
<b>I only cared about my daughter.</b>

221

<b>That's what everyone does.</b>

222
00:20:13,955 --> 00:20:15,999
<b>I also chose to live like this</b>

223
00:20:16,082 --> 00:20:18,793
<b>because my son would've done it

<b>But he wouldn't let me come close to him</b>

225

<b>because his son is still young.</b>

<b>That's what</b>

<b>all children do.</b>

228
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:30,847
<b>I would've done the same thing to my mom.</b>

229
00:20:33,141 --> 00:20:34,434
<b>Then what about the judgment?</b>

230
00:20:35,101 --> 00:20:36,603
<b>What's the deal with the judgment?</b>

231

<b>I can be greedy,</b>

234

<b>I won't do that.</b>

<b>It's neither of them.</b>

<b>What is it then?</b>

243
00:21:23,525 --> 00:21:24,734

<b><i>Come to think of it,</i></b>

249
00:22:26,421 --> 00:22:28,214
<b><i>I died all of a sudden</i></b>

250

<b><i>without getting to hold my kid</i></b>

251
00:22:31,509 --> 00:22:33,094
<b><i>and say goodbye to her.</i></b>

252
00:22:33,219 --> 00:22:35,930
<b><i>I guess I got this gift
because I was too pitiful.</i></b>

253
00:22:40,018 --> 00:22:42,604
<b>If I went up there just like that,
I would've been really upset.</b>

<b>But I'm fine now.</b>

255

<b>It's a blessing for you to

00:46:14,394 --> 00:46:16,521
<b>You were being too considerate.</b>

482
00:46:19,941 --> 00:46:21,860
<b>I didn't want to have regrets again.</b>

483
00:46:23,987 --> 00:46:25,447
<b>"I should've been nicer.</b>

484
00:46:29,409 --> 00:46:31,703
<b>I should've done what she asked.</b>

485
00:46:32,287 --> 00:46:33,205
<b>I should've</b>

486
00:46:34,206 --> 00:46:35,665
<b>held back."</b>

487
00:46:37,501 --> 00:46:39,544
<b>I didn't want to have those regrets again.</b>

488
00:46:41,671 --> 00:46:42,714
<b>Like I did with Yu-ri.</b>

489
00:46:45,509 --> 00:46:46,718
<b>You're finally opening up.</b>

490
00:46:54,351 --> 00:46:57,229
<b>Why are we having this talk now?</b>

491
00:46:58,814 --> 00:47:00,190
<b>After we've gone through</b>

492
00:47:01,358 --> 00:47:03,276
<b>a messy and bloody time.</b>

493
00:47:22,462 --> 00:47:23,547
<b>Cha Yu-ri.</b>

494
00:47:24,798 --> 00:47:25,841
<b>Yu-ri.</b>

495
00:47:33,223 --> 00:47:34,391
<b>Give her a good send-off.</b>

496
00:47:36,268 --> 00:47:38,311
<b>Put your heart into it
and do the best you can.</b>

497
00:47:41,064 --> 00:47:42,315
<b>Have no regrets.</b>

498
00:47:49,072 --> 00:47:50,198
<b>Let's talk about our divorce</b>

499
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:53,034
<b>after that.</b>

500
00:48:07,174 --> 00:48:10,051
<b><i>She prayed every single day.</i></b>

501
00:48:10,802 --> 00:48:13,138
<b><i>I thought she was praying
for her daughter's peace,</i></b>

502
00:48:14,181 --> 00:48:15,390
<b><i>but that wasn't it.</i></b>

503
00:48:17,058 --> 00:48:18,768
<b><i>She was praying</i></b>

504
00:48:19,644 --> 00:48:21,229
<b><i>to see her daughter one more time.</i></b>

505
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:38,038
<b>Goodness.</b>

506
00:48:38,622 --> 00:48:39,956
<b>What are you doing?</b>

507
00:48:40,707 --> 00:48:42,500
<b>I want to look at you closely.</b>

508
00:48:43,084 --> 00:48:46,463
<b>Goodness, are you a kid?</b>

509
00:48:46,963 --> 00:48:49,049
<b>Yes, I'm your kid.</b>

510
00:48:52,969 --> 00:48:54,804
<b>When I'm done folding laundry,</b>

511
00:48:55,055 --> 00:48:56,681
<b>I have something to give you.</b>

512
00:49:07,805 --> 00:49:08,848
<b>Mom.</b>

513
00:49:08,931 --> 00:49:11,100
<b>What are you waiting for? Eat.</b>

514
00:49:13,144 --> 00:49:14,103
<b>Here.</b>

515
00:49:14,854 --> 00:49:17,690
<b>It's wild seaweed, so it's really soft.</b>

516
00:49:17,774 --> 00:49:19,067
<b>Go ahead and try it.</b>

517
00:49:23,780 --> 00:49:25,114
<b>You should eat too.</b>

518
00:49:27,825 --> 00:49:28,785
<b>Should I?</b>

519
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:53,059
<b>Eat.</b>

520
00:50:10,409 --> 00:50:11,410
<b>It's tasty.</b>

521
00:50:26,759 --> 00:50:28,094
<b>Was it tasty?</b>

522
00:50:28,177 --> 00:50:29,303
<b>Yes.</b>

523
00:50:30,429 --> 00:50:31,889
<b>I'd bought</b>

524
00:50:33,015 --> 00:50:35,560
<b>so much seaweed,</b>

525
00:50:35,643 --> 00:50:38,229
<b>thinking I'd give it to you
when you gave birth.</b>

526
00:50:38,729 --> 00:50:41,149
<b>The whole sink was filled with seaweed.</b>

527
00:50:44,527 --> 00:50:46,028
<b>Finally, I got you to eat it now.</b>

528
00:50:46,445 --> 00:50:48,030
<b>It was really tasty.</b>

529
00:50:52,660 --> 00:50:53,619
<b>Yu-ri.</b>

530
00:50:56,330 --> 00:51:00,126
<b>Can I ask you something?</b>

531
00:51:03,963 --> 00:51:04,839
<b>Sure.</b>

532
00:51:12,555 --> 00:51:13,681
<b>Were you</b>

533
00:51:16,475 --> 00:51:17,476
<b>with me</b>

534
00:51:19,270 --> 00:51:21,689
<b>the whole time?</b>

535
00:51:30,948 --> 00:51:32,116
<b>Were you?</b>

536
00:51:36,245 --> 00:51:37,496
<b>Tell me, were you?</b>

537
00:51:42,168 --> 00:51:43,127
<b>Mom.</b>

538
00:51:53,804 --> 00:51:55,014
<b>So you were.</b>

539
00:51:57,892 --> 00:51:59,227
<b>You were.</b>

540
00:52:03,814 --> 00:52:05,399
<b>I thought</b>

541
00:52:07,193 --> 00:52:10,404
<b>you put Seo-woo's stuff away
because you missed her.</b>

542
00:52:17,662 --> 00:52:19,622
<b>But it was because of me, right?</b>

543
00:52:28,756 --> 00:52:29,924
<b>So that was it.</b>

544
00:52:32,885 --> 00:52:36,138
<b>You were with me the whole time.</b>

545
00:52:39,141 --> 00:52:41,060
<b>I had no idea.</b>

546
00:52:45,147 --> 00:52:47,775
<b>I'm sorry I suffered too much.</b>

547
00:52:49,527 --> 00:52:51,570
<b>You must have felt so sad.</b>

548
00:53:29,191 --> 00:53:30,109
<b>Don't cry.</b>

549
00:53:32,445 --> 00:53:34,155
<b>Mom, don't cry.</b>

550
00:54:01,307 --> 00:54:02,892
<b>It's okay, Mom.</b>

551
00:54:05,936 --> 00:54:08,105
<b>Did you miss me a lot?</b>

552
00:54:11,025 --> 00:54:12,151
<b>Yes.</b>

553
00:54:14,695 --> 00:54:17,156
<b>I wished I could see you
just one more time.</b>

554
00:54:18,949 --> 00:54:20,284
<b>There was something</b>

555
00:54:21,535 --> 00:54:25,289
<b>I really wanted to say to you.</b>

556
00:54:35,257 --> 00:54:36,884
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

557
00:54:41,222 --> 00:54:42,723
<b>Why are you sorry?</b>

558
00:54:43,224 --> 00:54:45,101
<b>Why would you say that?</b>

559
00:54:49,522 --> 00:54:52,066
<b>You cried even when you just</b>

560
00:54:52,358 --> 00:54:54,568
<b>cut your finger a little.</b>

561
00:54:56,654 --> 00:55:00,241
<b>To think that you suffered
on that cold ground alone.</b>

562
00:55:02,118 --> 00:55:04,412
<b>To think how scared you would have been.</b>

563
00:55:06,539 --> 00:55:09,917
<b>I could never seem
to let go of that thought.</b>

564
00:55:12,962 --> 00:55:15,673
<b>I'm sorry I couldn't be with you.</b>

565
00:55:16,340 --> 00:55:18,426
<b>I'm sorry I left you alone, my baby.</b>

566
00:55:23,139 --> 00:55:25,141
<b>I wasn't scared at all.</b>

567
00:55:27,393 --> 00:55:30,604
<b>I stayed strong to the end.</b>

568
00:55:31,564 --> 00:55:33,232
<b>I wasn't alone.</b>

569
00:55:33,649 --> 00:55:37,153
<b>I was with Seo-woo, Mom.</b>

570
00:55:38,904 --> 00:55:40,489
<b>That's why I could stay strong.</b>

571
00:55:42,116 --> 00:55:43,868
<b>I wasn't scared.</b>

572
00:55:58,382 --> 00:55:59,508
<b>Mom.</b>

573
00:56:00,551 --> 00:56:03,804
<b>Mom.</b>

574
00:56:08,476 --> 00:56:09,935
<b>Her son is here again.</b>

575
00:56:10,019 --> 00:56:11,520
<b>Mom.</b>

576
00:56:11,604 --> 00:56:13,105
<b>He comes here every time he drinks.</b>

577
00:56:14,023 --> 00:56:15,399
<b>He's been coming here often lately.</b>

578
00:56:17,193 --> 00:56:20,070
<b>I guess he has a lot of trouble
to drink for.</b>

579
00:56:21,447 --> 00:56:23,699
<b>Making ends meet isn't easy.</b>

580
00:56:23,782 --> 00:56:25,868
<b>Even when you get old,</b>

581
00:56:27,036 --> 00:56:29,955
<b>you can't help but miss your mom.</b>

582
00:56:33,292 --> 00:56:35,252
<b>When you're at that age,</b>

583
00:56:36,545 --> 00:56:40,174
<b>you don't have anywhere to go
to cry all you want.</b>

584
00:56:40,257 --> 00:56:41,550
<b>That's the age</b>

585
00:56:42,051 --> 00:56:44,220
<b>you miss your mom the most.</b>

586
00:56:46,388 --> 00:56:49,892
<b>I miss my mom, too.</b>

587
00:56:50,684 --> 00:56:52,686
<b>Mom.</b>

588
00:56:55,981 --> 00:56:57,775
<b>My baby.</b>

589
00:56:58,609 --> 00:56:59,693
<b>It's okay.</b>

590
00:57:00,110 --> 00:57:01,028
<b>It's all right.</b>

591
00:57:03,447 --> 00:57:04,532
<b>There.</b>

592
00:57:04,615 --> 00:57:05,699
<b>It's okay.</b>

593
00:57:08,244 --> 00:57:09,703
<b>It's all right.</b>

594
00:57:10,454 --> 00:57:12,665
<b>Mom.</b>

595
00:57:13,624 --> 00:57:14,750
<b>It's okay.</b>

596
00:57:14,875 --> 00:57:15,876
<b>It's all right.</b>

597
00:57:21,382 --> 00:57:22,466
<b>My baby.</b>

598
00:57:24,301 --> 00:57:26,845
<b>Goodness. My baby.</b>

599
00:57:37,523 --> 00:57:38,607
<b>Is there</b>

600
00:57:40,526 --> 00:57:41,735
<b>really no way?</b>

601
00:57:42,987 --> 00:57:43,821
<b>No.</b>

602
00:57:44,655 --> 00:57:45,573
<b>There isn't.</b>

603
00:57:49,952 --> 00:57:50,911
<b>Do you</b>

604
00:57:53,956 --> 00:57:55,040
<b>really want to leave?</b>

605
00:58:00,254 --> 00:58:01,213
<b>Yes.</b>

606
00:58:13,851 --> 00:58:16,061
<b>If only I had known a little earlier...</b>

607
00:58:18,522 --> 00:58:19,857
<b>Then I would've</b>

608
00:58:19,940 --> 00:58:22,151
<b>let you see Seo-woo more often.</b>

609
00:58:24,945 --> 00:58:25,863
<b>I acted like a fool.</b>

610
00:58:26,530 --> 00:58:27,531
<b>No.</b>

611
00:58:28,616 --> 00:58:30,200
<b>I was a ghost,</b>

612
00:58:30,284 --> 00:58:32,328
<b>so these moments were
really precious to me.</b>

613
00:58:33,412 --> 00:58:35,539
<b>I could touch Seo-woo.</b>

614
00:58:36,165 --> 00:58:38,417
<b>I could hold you when you were hurting.</b>

615
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:39,668
<b>To me,</b>

616
00:58:40,377 --> 00:58:41,629
<b>it was like a gift.</b>

617
00:58:52,473 --> 00:58:55,017
<b>How can I let you go again?</b>

618
00:59:01,148 --> 00:59:02,358
<b>I'm sorry, Gang-hwa.</b>

619
00:59:03,984 --> 00:59:05,486
<b>I'm sorry about five years ago</b>

620
00:59:05,569 --> 00:59:06,779
<b>and now.</b>

621
00:59:09,031 --> 00:59:10,157
<b>I'm really sorry</b>

<b>I'm sorry about everything.</b>

625

<b>Why are you sorry?</b>

626

<b>When you've given me so much.</b>

<b>Thank you</b>
