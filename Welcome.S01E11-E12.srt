<b>Who...</b>

3
00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:15,080
<b>are you?</b>

4
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:19,519
<b>Bang Guk Bong.</b>

5
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:24,489
<b>Bang Guk Bong.</b>

6
00:00:26,089 --> 00:00:27,960
<b>Can you get me some water?</b>

7
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:29,899
<b>I feel like throwing up.</b>

8
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:31,359
<b>Let's go to the bathroom.</b>

9
00:01:14,739 --> 00:01:16,209
<b>What are you doing here?</b>

10
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,150
<b>- Water.
- I need to check...</b>

11
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,579
<b>if you're really Bang Guk Bong.</b>

12
00:01:31,489 --> 00:01:34,260
<b>I met a guy earlier, and he told me
his name was Bang Guk Bong.</b>

13
00:01:35,489 --> 00:01:37,560
<b>And he didn't seem to have
a reason to lie.</b>

14
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:42,439
<b>Show me your ID.</b>

15
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:51,209
<b>I knew it. No wonder you seemed
quite unusual from the start.</b>

16
00:01:52,349 --> 00:01:54,650
<b>You lied and pretended to be
someone else.</b>

17
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,819
<b>What is it that you want?</b>

18
00:02:00,849 --> 00:02:01,849
<b>Hey.</b>

19
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:04,920
<b>Tell me who you are.</b>

20
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:10,759
<b>Let me call the police first.</b>

21
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,230
<b>Hong...</b>

22
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,039
<b>What?</b>

23
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:19,310
<b>Hong Jo.</b>

24
00:02:28,979 --> 00:02:30,849
<b>Water.</b>

25
00:02:31,849 --> 00:02:33,949
<b>Give me some water.</b>

26
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:36,759
<b>Water...</b>

27
00:02:37,289 --> 00:02:39,629
<b>Can I have some water?</b>

28
00:02:41,659 --> 00:02:42,800
<b>Water.</b>

<b>(Quote by Hazel Nicholson)</b>

31
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:02,670
<b>He must've left through the window.</b>

32
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,409
<b>Yes, that must be it.</b>

33
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,919
<b>I sneezed every time I was near him.</b>

34

<b>Oh, gosh! Jae Seon?</b>

35
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:03,670
<b>What are you doing here?</b>

36
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:06,540
<b>I was worried.</b>

37
00:05:07,209 --> 00:05:08,240
<b>About what?</b>

38
00:05:09,579 --> 00:05:11,680
<b>- Me?
- It looked like you drank a lot.</b>

39
00:05:13,449 --> 00:05:15,329
<b>I didn't want to leave you here
all by yourself.</b>

40
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:18,949
<b>Then you were here since last night?</b>

41
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:21,889
<b>Do you want some coffee?</b>

42
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:24,990
<b>You stayed here all night?</b>

43
00:05:27,029 --> 00:05:28,790
<b>Where's Guk Bong?</b>

44
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:35,699
<b>I wonder if he left already.</b>

45
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:43,879
<b>I'm not sure.</b>

46
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,920
<b>Did you cook this?</b>

47
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:54,490
<b>Eat up.</b>

48
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:56,319
<b>What about you?</b>

49
00:05:57,319 --> 00:05:58,420
<b>I'm fine with just coffee.</b>

50
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:13,509
<b>The rice tastes delicious.</b>

51
00:06:14,269 --> 00:06:15,980
<b>Guk Bong likes rice too.</b>

52
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,719
<b>I guess he left
without eating breakfast again.</b>

53
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:28,050
<b>Did you happen...</b>

54
00:06:28,819 --> 00:06:31,189
<b>to notice anything weird about him?</b>

55
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:32,730
<b>He's really weird.</b>

56
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:35,210
<b>But that's why
he's so fun to be with.</b>

57
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,136
<b>Are you guys close already?</b>

58
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,000
<b>Yes, he understands me very well.
It's kind of weird.</b>

59
00:06:43,699 --> 00:06:46,110
<b>Make sure you keep your door closed
when you sleep.</b>

60
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:47,815
<b>Don't forget to lock the door.</b>

61
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:51,180
<b>There's no need to worry about that.
I know him well enough.</b>

62
00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:53,250
<b>Just keep a distance.</b>

63
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:55,130
<b>I think he's going to leave
on a trip again.</b>

64
00:06:55,509 --> 00:06:58,620
<b>Now that he's about to leave,
I feel like I'm going to miss him.</b>

65
00:06:59,649 --> 00:07:01,350
<b>I guess he kind of grew on me.</b>

66
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:04,696
<b>- Sol Ah.
- My gosh, I even started...</b>

67
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,029
<b>to like his name.</b>

68
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:09,430
<b>- But he even changed his name...
- You should be more suspicious.</b>

69
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,300
<b>What?</b>

70
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:16,269
<b>He might not be the guy
you think he is.</b>

71
00:07:17,269 --> 00:07:19,740
<b>- What are you talking about?
- Come see me after work.</b>

72
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:22,310
<b>Don't be with him.</b>

73
00:07:23,139 --> 00:07:25,810
<b>- Why all of a sudden?
- Just do as I say.</b>

74
00:07:26,649 --> 00:07:28,369
<b>I also have something important
to tell you.</b>

75
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:35,165
<b>- I can't tell you what it is yet.
- "Something important"?</b>

76
00:07:35,189 --> 00:07:36,896
<b>I'll look after the cat
while you're at work.</b>

77
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,459
<b>Why? Just leave him here.</b>

78
00:07:39,189 --> 00:07:40,589
<b>I need to check something.</b>

79
00:07:52,269 --> 00:07:53,370
<b>Ji Eun.</b>

80
00:07:56,379 --> 00:07:57,379
<b>Is that not her?</b>

81
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,279
<b>Hey, it's you.</b>

82
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,149
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

83
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,520
<b>I said a bunch of nonsense yesterday
because I was too drunk.</b>

84
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:15,689
<b>I want to talk to you
about something. Is that okay?</b>

85
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:18,860
<b>He stayed up all night
in front of your room?</b>

86
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:20,269
<b>Yes.</b>

87
00:08:21,029 --> 00:08:22,815
<b>And he even cooked for you?</b>

88
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:25,470
<b>Then he even offered
to look after the cat.</b>

89
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:28,115
<b>Just like how couples
take care of each other's cat?</b>

90
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:30,709
<b>- Isn't that weird?
- It's a good thing.</b>

91
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,315
<b>Now that the misunderstanding
is gone,</b>

92
00:08:32,339 --> 00:08:33,699
<b>he's trying to take the next step.</b>

93
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:35,310
<b>It's charming.</b>

94
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:38,019
<b>Why does it feel so weird though?</b>

95
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:43,220
<b>Maybe it just feels unreal
since it took him so long.</b>

96
00:08:44,289 --> 00:08:45,490
<b>Yes, it's been a long time.</b>

97
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:48,860
<b>I liked him for a long time
and suffered a lot.</b>

98
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,549
<b>And it took me so long
to get over him.</b>

99
00:08:53,529 --> 00:08:55,500
<b>I don't want to start
liking him again.</b>

100
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:59,070
<b>But still, it took so long
to finally work.</b>

101
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:02,210
<b>I know I'm being a little weird.</b>

102
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:06,710
<b>But it's just strange.
It's best that we stay friends.</b>

103
00:09:08,009 --> 00:09:10,089
<b>How can you be friends
with someone you used to like?</b>

104
00:09:12,789 --> 00:09:13,919
<b>Is that even possible?</b>

105
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:15,690
<b>Well...</b>

106
00:09:16,659 --> 00:09:18,720
<b>Maybe time will make it possible.</b>

107
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:28,899
<b>I don't think
I'll ever be able to do that...</b>

108
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:31,600
<b>no matter how much time passes by.</b>

109
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:34,539
<b>What are you guys doing?</b>

110
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:40,850
<b>Why are you guys suddenly so quiet?</b>

111
00:09:41,049 --> 00:09:42,895
<b>I'm quick-witted, you know.
I can tell what's going on.</b>

112
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:44,895
<b>You guys suddenly stopped talking
as soon as I came.</b>

113
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:46,120
<b>I should go now.</b>

114
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,196
<b>What's going on?</b>

115
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,436
<b>I heard you guys drank without me.</b>

116
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,830
<b>What did you guys talk about?</b>

117
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,970
<b>Please don't tell Doo Sik.</b>

118
00:10:01,429 --> 00:10:03,240
<b>Don't try to give him ideas...</b>

119
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:07,470
<b>or make things awkward
by trying to help me date him.</b>

120
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:14,980
<b>I'll quit.</b>

121
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:17,850
<b>No.</b>

122
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:21,850
<b>I'll just die.</b>

123
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:26,120
<b>Okay, I won't tell him.</b>

124
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:27,837
<b>I won't.</b>

125
00:10:27,861 --> 00:10:30,330
<b>- Will you please tell me?
- My gosh.</b>

126
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:33,529
<b>- Hello.
- Hello.</b>

127
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,740
<b>There's definitely
something going on.</b>

128
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:40,385
<b>I'm so curious. I'm so curious.</b>

129
00:10:40,409 --> 00:10:41,909
<b>Nothing's going on.</b>

130
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,820
<b>(Do you think he knows
what's going on?)</b>

131
00:10:51,379 --> 00:10:54,250
<b>(Don't worry. He's slow-witted.)</b>

132
00:10:56,889 --> 00:10:58,296
<b>You told her that I'm slow-witted,
didn't you?</b>

133
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,129
<b>I'm quick-witted, aren't I?</b>

134
00:11:00,629 --> 00:11:03,035
<b>It was about work.
We were talking about the project.</b>

135
00:11:03,059 --> 00:11:04,830
<b>Aren't I part of the project?</b>

136
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:08,700
<b>Ji Eun, do you want me
out of the group?</b>

137
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:11,639
<b>I left a note over there.</b>

138
00:11:15,309 --> 00:11:16,709
<b>(Color tone: Healthy-looking green)</b>

139
00:11:40,429 --> 00:11:41,405
<b>Sol Ah.</b>

140
00:11:41,429 --> 00:11:42,429
<b>Yes?</b>

141
00:11:42,529 --> 00:11:44,200
<b>Are you and Ji Eun friends now?</b>

142
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,716
<b>How did you manage to do that?</b>

143
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:49,216
<b>We talked and there's a connection.</b>

144
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,515
<b>- What connection?
- There's no connection.</b>

145
00:11:51,539 --> 00:11:54,426
<b>Sol Ah's trying hard to
keep the project afloat.</b>

146
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:56,155
<b>Covering for the employee
who was served a job.</b>

147
00:11:56,179 --> 00:11:59,096
<b>It was a misunderstanding that
she was given the job.</b>

148
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,796
<b>I asked her about it.</b>

149
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,096
<b>How is that credible?</b>

150
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,800
<b>Of course she'd deny
she was given the job.</b>

151
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:08,059
<b>She would, right?</b>

152
00:12:08,529 --> 00:12:11,100
<b>Where did you hear that
she got the job as a favor?</b>

153
00:12:11,299 --> 00:12:12,405
<b>- Me?
- Yes.</b>

154
00:12:12,429 --> 00:12:14,700
<b>If you tell me, I'll check.</b>

155
00:12:14,929 --> 00:12:16,230
<b>I heard it from...</b>

<b>Why look at me?</b>

158
00:12:23,179 --> 00:12:25,509
<b>I heard about it from Da Som.</b>

159
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:28,355
<b>That's weird.</b>

160
00:12:28,379 --> 00:12:31,519
<b>I definitely heard about it

164

<b>Are you a human?</b>

165

<b>I don't, but...</b>

169
00:13:27,909 --> 00:13:30,686
<b>Do you know if I could meet...</b>

170
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:33,149
<b>the person who lives here?</b>

171
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:36,110
<b>What business do you have
with that person?</b>

172

<b>I'm not a strange person.</b>

<b>Hey.</b>

<b>Hey, wait.</b>

<b>There are cars around here!</b>

<b>How did you

<b>Are you also going to leave

00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:11,059
<b>The cat I picked up was actually
a human being?</b>

314
00:27:22,039 --> 00:27:23,210
<b>What are you doing?</b>

315
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:28,480
<b>I can't believe what I'm seeing.</b>

316
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:31,849
<b>How can a human change into a cat?</b>

317
00:27:32,079 --> 00:27:33,720
<b>It's the other way around.</b>

318
00:27:34,589 --> 00:27:36,349
<b>That still doesn't make sense.</b>

319
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:38,420
<b>How long have you been like this?</b>

320
00:27:38,759 --> 00:27:41,335
<b>What about your parents?
Are they cats or humans?</b>

321
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:45,099
<b>Or did you escape from a secret
research institute or something?</b>

322
00:27:48,069 --> 00:27:49,529
<b>All I know...</b>

323
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:52,140
<b>is that Sol Ah...</b>

324
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:55,240
<b>makes me turn human.</b>

325
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,240
<b>What do you mean?</b>

326
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:02,150
<b>I'm able to turn human
when I'm with her.</b>

327
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,519
<b>But she's not here right now.</b>

328
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:09,519
<b>Her belongings.</b>

329
00:28:14,029 --> 00:28:15,029
<b>That's absurd.</b>

330
00:28:17,559 --> 00:28:18,630
<b>But Sol Ah...</b>

331
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:23,700
<b>has no idea that she has the ability
to turn a cat into a human?</b>

332
00:28:25,569 --> 00:28:29,140
<b>Please don't tell Sol Ah about this.</b>

333
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:31,779
<b>Why not?</b>

334
00:28:33,309 --> 00:28:34,750
<b>Because I won't
get to stay with her.</b>

335
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,809
<b>You want me to leave you
with Sol Ah?</b>

336
00:28:37,619 --> 00:28:39,079
<b>Even after I found out who you are?</b>

337
00:28:40,119 --> 00:28:41,150
<b>I mean,</b>

338
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:44,690
<b>you might be human,
a cat, or a monster.</b>

339
00:28:45,289 --> 00:28:47,835
<b>I don't even know
what to think of you.</b>

340
00:28:47,859 --> 00:28:50,930
<b>I have no idea either,
but I won't do anything bad.</b>

341
00:28:53,059 --> 00:28:54,170
<b>Why Sol Ah?</b>

342
00:28:55,369 --> 00:28:57,269
<b>Is it because you want to be human?</b>

343
00:28:59,099 --> 00:29:00,470
<b>I wasn't the one...</b>

344
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:02,869
<b>who wanted to be human.</b>

345
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,079
<b>Sol Ah was the one
who made me turn into a human.</b>

346
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:11,680
<b>So maybe she needed me.</b>

347
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:14,250
<b>What?</b>

348
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:16,190
<b>She was alone...</b>

349
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:20,160
<b>because of you.</b>

350
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:31,869
<b>I'll do what you say.</b>

351
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,940
<b>If you tell me not to turn human,
I'll just stay as a cat.</b>

352
00:29:35,539 --> 00:29:36,910
<b>Just let me be with Sol Ah.</b>

353
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:43,009
<b>Jae Seon.</b>

354
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,349
<b>I'm here to pick up Hong Jo.</b>

355
00:30:02,769 --> 00:30:04,500
<b>- You were in there?
- Yes.</b>

356
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,069
<b>Are you okay?
Didn't you get injured?</b>

357
00:30:09,210 --> 00:30:10,269
<b>I'm okay.</b>

358
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:12,279
<b>Where is Hong Jo?</b>

359
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:23,690
<b>By the way, I never got to hear
what you wanted to tell me.</b>

360
00:30:24,859 --> 00:30:27,019
<b>You were telling me
something important.</b>

361
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:29,859
<b>Oh, that.</b>

362
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,400
<b>Just forget it.
Don't let it bother you.</b>

363
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,670
<b>Okay.</b>

364
00:30:42,769 --> 00:30:44,140
<b>Let's stop talking about the past.</b>

365
00:30:46,339 --> 00:30:48,710
<b>Things wouldn't have worked out
even if it weren't for that.</b>

366
00:30:51,019 --> 00:30:54,595
<b>I would've wanted to find out
more about you,</b>

367
00:30:54,619 --> 00:30:56,849
<b>talk to you a lot,
and expect you to do the same.</b>

368
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:01,260
<b>But you would've looked for excuses
to push me away.</b>

369
00:31:02,329 --> 00:31:04,130
<b>This time, it's not an excuse.</b>

370
00:31:07,529 --> 00:31:08,630
<b>I have my reasons.</b>

371
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,160
<b>Of course it's something
you can't tell me, right?</b>

372
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,680
<b>I can't say what I was going to say,</b>

373
00:31:27,789 --> 00:31:29,950
<b>but instead,
I'll say something else.</b>

374
00:31:34,059 --> 00:31:35,089
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

375
00:31:37,259 --> 00:31:39,000
<b>I got the wrong idea about you.</b>

376
00:31:39,859 --> 00:31:43,170
<b>I didn't say anything
or hear your side of it.</b>

377
00:31:44,839 --> 00:31:48,269
<b>I just left you alone
so I could be alone.</b>

378
00:31:50,569 --> 00:31:51,779
<b>I'm sorry about that.</b>

379
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:05,460
<b>Why would you say that now?</b>

380
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:08,430
<b>We're friends.</b>

381
00:32:10,829 --> 00:32:11,900
<b>To be honest,</b>

382
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:14,269
<b>I was never a friend to you.</b>

383
00:32:22,170 --> 00:32:23,210
<b>I know.</b>

384
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,910
<b>You know that and so do I.</b>

385
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:31,349
<b>But even if we knew how we felt,
it still didn't work out.</b>

386
00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:35,789
<b>Doesn't that mean it never will?</b>

387
00:32:37,089 --> 00:32:38,119
<b>Then...</b>

388
00:32:40,259 --> 00:32:41,789
<b>do you think we can be friends?</b>

389
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,400
<b>I don't think I can do that.</b>

390
00:32:51,569 --> 00:32:52,670
<b>But I still...</b>

391
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:54,769
<b>If you fall in love
with someone else,</b>

392
00:32:56,839 --> 00:32:59,940
<b>then I'll be a real friend
to you then.</b>

393
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:32,929
<b>(Episode 12)</b>

394
00:33:35,059 --> 00:33:36,099
<b>It suits you.</b>

395
00:33:38,699 --> 00:33:40,106
<b>This is animal abuse.</b>

396
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:41,539
<b>You said you'd do as I say.</b>

397
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:43,670
<b>I'll even pay you hourly wages.</b>

398
00:33:43,870 --> 00:33:46,210
<b>You're not even human
and I'll pay you.</b>

399
00:33:50,850 --> 00:33:52,079
<b>I can't work full-time.</b>

400
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,826
<b>You talk like you're human.</b>

401
00:33:53,850 --> 00:33:55,820
<b>I can't stay human for too long.</b>

402
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:58,050
<b>There's a limit to my stamina.</b>

403
00:33:58,949 --> 00:33:59,990
<b>Is that true?</b>

404
00:34:00,859 --> 00:34:02,099
<b>What happens when you're tired?</b>

405
00:34:02,189 --> 00:34:03,359
<b>I fall asleep as a cat.</b>

406
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,700
<b>Are there any more?
Weaknesses, I mean.</b>

407
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:13,770
<b>There is.</b>

408
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,009
<b>What are you doing?</b>

409
00:34:19,170 --> 00:34:20,170
<b>Finding a weakness.</b>

410
00:34:24,979 --> 00:34:27,649
<b>Oh. Is that not my weakness?</b>

411
00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:36,560
<b>Don't ever get out of my sight.</b>

412
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:39,129
<b>Is this what you wanted to do?
Monitor me?</b>

413
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:56,340
<b>He went overboard.
This isn't the right green.</b>

414
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,926
<b>What is this?</b>

415
00:34:57,950 --> 00:34:58,950
<b>Ji Eun.</b>

416
00:35:00,879 --> 00:35:03,150
<b>Wow. You look like
you stepped on a turd.</b>

417
00:35:03,549 --> 00:35:04,920
<b>Can you stop hating me?</b>

418
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:10,560
<b>You have a lot in your bag today.
What's all this?</b>

419
00:35:10,890 --> 00:35:11,890
<b>Give it back.</b>

420
00:35:13,930 --> 00:35:15,760
<b>Gosh, I really hate it.</b>

421
00:35:16,299 --> 00:35:17,739
<b>That feeling when someone hates you.</b>

422
00:35:18,469 --> 00:35:20,245
<b>It was okay when she hated us both.</b>

423
00:35:20,269 --> 00:35:21,370
<b>Why is it just me now?</b>

424
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:26,670
<b>Da Som. Do you like me?</b>

425
00:35:26,909 --> 00:35:29,480
<b>I do like you. You're cute.</b>

426
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:31,780
<b>What about you? Do you like me?</b>

427
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:36,550
<b>You do have a messy desk,
but I kind of like you.</b>

428
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:38,349
<b>What about you? Do you like me?</b>

429
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:40,126
<b>We're both guys. Why ask?</b>

430
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:41,520
<b>Do you like me or not?</b>

431
00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:44,590
<b>Okay, fine. I like you loads.</b>

432
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,259
<b>See? They all like me.</b>

433
00:35:47,699 --> 00:35:50,699
<b>It's no joke, but you're
the first person to not like me.</b>

434
00:35:54,370 --> 00:35:55,569
<b>I'll make you like me.</b>

435
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,009
<b>Do you still dislike me?</b>

436
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:05,810
<b>The toner...</b>

437
00:36:09,219 --> 00:36:10,650
<b>You like one of these, don't you?</b>

438
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:13,250
<b>I have a tumbler.</b>

439
00:36:14,050 --> 00:36:15,159
<b>Thank you.</b>

440
00:36:16,789 --> 00:36:17,860
<b>Sure.</b>

441
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:31,909
<b>Will you like me now?</b>

442
00:36:33,569 --> 00:36:35,210
<b>- Why...
- Thank you.</b>

443
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,280
<b>It's so hard.</b>

444
00:36:52,889 --> 00:36:53,930
<b>Do you want...</b>

445
00:36:56,599 --> 00:36:59,506
<b>to have lunch with me?</b>

446
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:00,599
<b>Me too?</b>

447
00:37:04,270 --> 00:37:06,210
<b>Did you eat this well on your own?</b>

448
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:09,840
<b>It wasn't because
I didn't want to eat with you.</b>

449
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:14,050
<b>I'm a slow eater
and I thought I'd be a nuisance.</b>

450
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:17,349
<b>If I try to eat faster, I get sick.</b>

451
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,990
<b>Oh. I see.</b>

452
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:22,020
<b>I didn't know about that.</b>

453
00:37:23,419 --> 00:37:25,990
<b>I need to go to the restroom.</b>

454
00:37:33,569 --> 00:37:35,240
<b>You're a slow mover as well.</b>

455
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,400
<b>Give me that.</b>

456
00:37:42,039 --> 00:37:43,080
<b>Will you like me now?</b>

457
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,180
<b>Is that all?</b>

458
00:37:50,779 --> 00:37:52,790
<b>Oh? Something just fell out.</b>

459
00:37:56,490 --> 00:37:58,365
<b>- What is it?
- Nothing.</b>

460
00:37:58,389 --> 00:38:00,360
<b>You're hiding it
and it makes me more curious.</b>

461
00:38:00,589 --> 00:38:01,759
<b>What is it? Let me see.</b>

462
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:04,100
<b>You'll show it to Sol Ah, won't you?</b>

463
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:06,269
<b>Why won't you show it to me?</b>

464
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,040
<b>You can't see it.</b>

465
00:38:11,139 --> 00:38:12,670
<b>Will you just like me too?</b>

466
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:20,250
<b>Will they even talk to each other?</b>

467
00:38:22,379 --> 00:38:24,790
<b>Can we just forget about it?</b>

468
00:38:25,790 --> 00:38:27,089
<b>I will if you like me.</b>

469
00:38:34,029 --> 00:38:35,129
<b>I like you.</b>

470
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:37,670
<b>What?</b>

471
00:38:48,779 --> 00:38:49,810
<b>My eraser?</b>

472
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:52,449
<b>It's from when I was in high school.</b>

473
00:38:54,850 --> 00:38:55,850
<b>Why?</b>

474
00:38:57,019 --> 00:38:58,050
<b>Why?</b>

475
00:38:59,850 --> 00:39:00,959
<b>I love it here.</b>

476
00:39:02,389 --> 00:39:03,519
<b>He's so handsome.</b>

477
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,129
<b>Wash the mugs.</b>

478
00:39:13,529 --> 00:39:14,839
<b>Darn it.</b>

479
00:39:15,569 --> 00:39:17,569
<b>You do the cool stuff
while I wash the mugs?</b>

480
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:19,939
<b>It's not cool.</b>

481
00:39:20,569 --> 00:39:22,009
<b>I became a liar...</b>

482
00:39:22,379 --> 00:39:23,779
<b>just to keep your secret.</b>

483
00:39:24,279 --> 00:39:25,310
<b>Sorry about that.</b>

484
00:39:28,319 --> 00:39:30,879
<b>Why did you run off last winter
using me as an excuse?</b>

485
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:33,290
<b>You eavesdrop?</b>

486
00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:39,430
<b>Yes.</b>

487
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,860
<b>It was an excuse, but...</b>

488
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,000
<b>It wasn't just an excuse.</b>

489
00:39:45,329 --> 00:39:46,399
<b>Then what?</b>

490
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:51,110
<b>I felt ashamed.</b>

491
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:52,769
<b>About what?</b>

492
00:39:53,769 --> 00:39:54,839
<b>Jae Seon.</b>

493
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:58,779
<b>Hong Jo's not at home. Is he here?</b>

494
00:39:59,779 --> 00:40:00,779
<b>Right here.</b>

495
00:40:00,850 --> 00:40:01,920
<b>Hey.</b>

496
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,480
<b>Bang Guk Bong?</b>

497
00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:08,365
<b>- Oh, Hong Jo?
- Oh, Hong Jo?</b>

498
00:40:08,389 --> 00:40:09,490
<b>- In there.
- At home.</b>

499
00:40:10,019 --> 00:40:11,189
<b>What?</b>

500
00:40:12,490 --> 00:40:13,930
<b>At home.</b>

501
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:16,175
<b>He left. Check again.</b>

502
00:40:16,199 --> 00:40:17,930
<b>That's right. He'll be somewhere.</b>

503
00:40:20,129 --> 00:40:23,040
<b>What's going on?
You two seem oddly friendly.</b>

504
00:40:24,910 --> 00:40:26,139
<b>Do you work here?</b>

505
00:40:27,910 --> 00:40:29,509
<b>Yes. I was just about to
get off work.</b>

506
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,579
<b>- You need to do the dishes.
- You do it.</b>

507
00:40:36,949 --> 00:40:37,990
<b>Let's go home.</b>

508
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:48,230
<b>Wait.</b>

509
00:41:00,910 --> 00:41:01,939
<b>You're here again.</b>

510
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:04,339
<b>Shall I call the police?</b>

511
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,750
<b>I didn't do anything wrong.</b>

512
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:13,019
<b>We met last time...</b>

513
00:41:13,889 --> 00:41:14,889
<b>Do you know him?</b>

514
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:17,689
<b>I thought you were a nice person...</b>

515
00:41:19,089 --> 00:41:20,466
<b>who looked after stray cats.</b>

516
00:41:20,490 --> 00:41:23,476
<b>Oh, I wasn't planning on doing
anything bad.</b>

517
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:26,105
<b>I just missed her a bit.</b>

518
00:41:26,129 --> 00:41:28,269
<b>You know, the one who lives here...</b>

519
00:41:29,170 --> 00:41:32,339
<b>with nice legs and a pretty face...</b>

520
00:41:38,850 --> 00:41:39,910
<b>Why?</b>

521
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:43,680
<b>She seemed a bit lonely...</b>

522
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:45,990
<b>and it seemed dangerous too.</b>

523
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:49,136
<b>I think someone should
care for her.</b>

524
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:52,029
<b>Of course it's dangerous if
a suspicious guy lurks around.</b>

525
00:41:52,829 --> 00:41:56,136
<b>But may I ask who you are?</b>

526
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,360
<b>Someone who cares for her.</b>

527
00:41:59,830 --> 00:42:01,316
<b>She has someone who cares for her,</b>

528
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:03,375
<b>so stop lurking around a house
where a girl lives alone.</b>

529
00:42:03,399 --> 00:42:06,139
<b>She doesn't live alone.
I live with her.</b>

530
00:42:06,769 --> 00:42:08,580
<b>Sol Ah, come here. Let's go inside.</b>

531
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:09,980
<b>Wait.</b>

532
00:42:11,110 --> 00:42:13,226
<b>There seems to be
a misunderstanding.</b>

533
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:15,580
<b>I was talking about the cat.</b>

534
00:42:16,350 --> 00:42:19,620
<b>I didn't mean her. The cat.</b>

535
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,320
<b>What?</b>

536
00:42:21,559 --> 00:42:25,105
<b>The cat that lives here
seemed to be neglected.</b>

537
00:42:25,129 --> 00:42:28,275
<b>I saw it walking around the street
alone dangerously...</b>

538
00:42:28,299 --> 00:42:29,929
<b>a few times.</b>

539
00:42:36,769 --> 00:42:39,509
<b>- It's my cat.
- I know.</b>

540
00:42:40,610 --> 00:42:42,509
<b>I saw you a few times at the vet.</b>

541
00:42:42,879 --> 00:42:44,980
<b>What did it eat this time
to get sick?</b>

542
00:42:46,610 --> 00:42:47,679
<b>Well...</b>

543
00:42:49,179 --> 00:42:51,820
<b>I think it ate garlic.</b>

544
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:55,090
<b>Last time it was milk,
and this time it's garlic?</b>

545
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:56,659
<b>I'm just hoping...</b>

546
00:42:57,559 --> 00:42:59,830
<b>you have
some sense of responsibility.</b>

547
00:43:00,730 --> 00:43:04,100
<b>I'm sorry.
I tend to be a bit clumsy.</b>

548
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:13,409
<b>Don't worry.
That cat is more than happy.</b>

549
00:43:14,509 --> 00:43:17,679
<b>People believe
what they want to believe.</b>

550
00:43:18,779 --> 00:43:19,809
<b>Well, then.</b>

551
00:43:26,919 --> 00:43:28,289
<b>Someone who cares for her.</b>

552
00:43:29,789 --> 00:43:32,490
<b>She doesn't live alone.
I live with her.</b>

553
00:43:34,289 --> 00:43:36,159
<b>What is this feeling?</b>

554
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:41,100
<b>How strange.</b>

555
00:43:45,570 --> 00:43:47,809
<b>Hong Jo. Are you having trouble
sleeping too?</b>

556
00:43:48,610 --> 00:43:49,710
<b>Do you want a snack?</b>

557
00:43:54,009 --> 00:43:55,049
<b>All right.</b>

558
00:43:58,820 --> 00:43:59,820
<b>Let's see.</b>

559
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:05,590
<b>Guess which hand it's in.</b>

560
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:08,460
<b>Right hand? Left hand?</b>

561
00:44:11,059 --> 00:44:12,269
<b>It's right here.</b>

562
00:44:18,470 --> 00:44:19,840
<b>I better drink some milk.</b>

563
00:44:21,779 --> 00:44:23,440
<b>(Dad)</b>

564
00:44:25,250 --> 00:44:27,279
<b>To what do I owe the honor?</b>

565
00:44:27,909 --> 00:44:28,919
<b>Where are you?</b>

566
00:44:30,919 --> 00:44:32,049
<b>Are you alone?</b>

567
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:34,919
<b>In bed.</b>

568
00:44:35,889 --> 00:44:36,960
<b>The two of us.</b>

569
00:44:39,590 --> 00:44:40,960
<b>With my cat.</b>

570
00:44:45,799 --> 00:44:48,769
<b>- You know, tomorrow...
- I know it's tomorrow.</b>

571
00:44:49,169 --> 00:44:50,649
<b>She said she wants to
set the table...</b>

572
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:53,309
<b>for your mom's
ancestral rites ceremony.</b>

573
00:44:54,710 --> 00:44:56,039
<b>Ms. Bang?</b>

574
00:44:58,750 --> 00:44:59,850
<b>I'm grateful.</b>

575
00:45:01,149 --> 00:45:02,580
<b>I'm sorry to leave you alone.</b>

576
00:45:04,350 --> 00:45:06,820
<b>I told you I'm not alone.</b>

577
00:45:07,789 --> 00:45:08,860
<b>Good night.</b>

578
00:45:27,269 --> 00:45:29,009
<b>I was thinking of drinking milk.</b>

579
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:30,980
<b>How did you know?</b>

580
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:52,399
<b>- What are you doing?
- What?</b>

581
00:45:53,830 --> 00:45:54,899
<b>Aren't you going to sleep?</b>

582
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:57,460
<b>I keep seeing things
that I have to clean up.</b>

583
00:45:58,110 --> 00:45:59,830
<b>Aren't you just looking for things
to clean?</b>

584
00:46:50,759 --> 00:46:52,730
<b>Is that all? Anything else?</b>

585
00:46:57,299 --> 00:47:00,029
<b>There's one more place
that's been on my mind.</b>

586
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:08,840
<b>What on earth?
Why is it so clean in here?</b>

587
00:47:12,879 --> 00:47:14,279
<b>Do you even sleep?</b>

588
00:47:14,820 --> 00:47:16,850
<b>Do you go out every night
or something?</b>

589
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:22,220
<b>It doesn't seem like
anyone lives here.</b>

590
00:47:25,490 --> 00:47:27,529
<b>Are you done looking?
Let's go downstairs.</b>

591
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:47,480
<b>I found it.</b>

592
00:48:06,870 --> 00:48:08,000
<b>I think that's enough.</b>

593
00:48:12,409 --> 00:48:13,440
<b>Is something wrong?</b>

594
00:48:21,519 --> 00:48:22,519
<b>There is.</b>

595
00:48:26,190 --> 00:48:27,250
<b>Tell me.</b>

596
00:48:32,529 --> 00:48:34,059
<b>Why aren't you saying anything?</b>

597
00:48:37,159 --> 00:48:38,839
<b>Will you say something
if I press a button?</b>

598
00:48:43,799 --> 00:48:45,409
<b>Why aren't you saying anything?</b>

599
00:48:47,139 --> 00:48:48,819
<b>Will you say something
if I press a button?</b>

600
00:48:52,379 --> 00:48:53,549
<b>How do you know that?</b>

601
00:48:55,049 --> 00:48:56,850
<b>That's a secret between
me and my mom.</b>

602
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:00,426
<b>I heard it when I was young.</b>

603
00:49:00,450 --> 00:49:02,090
<b>My mom said it to me
when I was young too.</b>

604
00:49:03,419 --> 00:49:05,889
<b>- What about you?
- The first person I remember.</b>

605
00:49:07,389 --> 00:49:09,360
<b>You mean your mom, right?</b>

606
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:12,370
<b>You say the same thing
in such a cool way.</b>

607
00:49:25,610 --> 00:49:27,279
<b>Tomorrow is my mom's
death anniversary.</b>

608
00:49:29,450 --> 00:49:30,480
<b>The day she died.</b>

609
00:49:33,389 --> 00:49:36,090
<b>We used to hold a simple
ancestral rites ceremony at home.</b>

610
00:49:36,519 --> 00:49:38,359
<b>But my dad said he'll do it
starting this year.</b>

611
00:49:39,330 --> 00:49:40,730
<b>And your mom will help him.</b>

612
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:45,870
<b>So there's nothing for me to do.</b>

613
00:49:47,529 --> 00:49:50,100
<b>But why are you cleaning
in the middle of the night?</b>

614
00:49:54,570 --> 00:49:56,039
<b>I was always busy doing something.</b>

615
00:49:57,539 --> 00:50:00,625
<b>I cooked and cleaned
since middle school...</b>

616
00:50:00,649 --> 00:50:01,919
<b>and took care of my dad.</b>

617
00:50:03,049 --> 00:50:05,019
<b>My mom's death anniversary
passed by...</b>

618
00:50:05,289 --> 00:50:07,049
<b>just like any other hectic day,</b>

619
00:50:08,149 --> 00:50:10,490
<b>but this time, something felt empty
inside me.</b>

620
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:12,889
<b>So it felt like
I had to do something.</b>

621
00:50:16,659 --> 00:50:18,669
<b>How about going somewhere
you both remember?</b>

622
00:50:28,610 --> 00:50:32,309
<b>The home Mom raised me in
now belongs to someone else.</b>

623
00:50:37,019 --> 00:50:39,089
<b>Shall I go to the riverside
we used to visit?</b>

624
00:50:46,529 --> 00:50:48,289
<b>It's cold this year too.</b>

625
00:50:51,829 --> 00:50:54,029
<b>My mom used to love peaches.</b>

626
00:50:56,339 --> 00:50:58,640
<b>She passed away in the winter,</b>

627
00:50:58,869 --> 00:51:00,940
<b>so I can't give her peaches.</b>

628
00:51:03,839 --> 00:51:05,980
<b>I should go back downstairs.</b>

629
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:17,289
<b>Let's go together tomorrow.</b>

630
00:51:19,529 --> 00:51:20,559
<b>The riverside.</b>

631
00:51:23,529 --> 00:51:24,930
<b>I'll be with you.</b>

632
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:43,480
<b>You're doing something
I didn't tell you to.</b>

633
00:51:43,750 --> 00:51:45,390
<b>I'm leaving after this is done.</b>

634
00:51:46,450 --> 00:51:48,390
<b>A part-timer's taking time off?</b>

635
00:51:50,819 --> 00:51:53,529
<b>Who said that cats return favors?</b>

636
00:51:55,329 --> 00:51:56,759
<b>I have important plans.</b>

637
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:59,069
<b>If it's important to you...</b>

638
00:52:03,970 --> 00:52:06,886
<b>I'm the person you should
consider most important.</b>

639
00:52:06,910 --> 00:52:10,109
<b>I found you half frozen to death
and bathed and fed you.</b>

640
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:11,417
<b>I saved you.</b>

641
00:52:11,441 --> 00:52:12,579
<b>I don't remember that.</b>

642
00:52:13,910 --> 00:52:15,779
<b>Look at these scars.</b>

643
00:52:20,019 --> 00:52:22,059
<b>Why did you take me in?
You should've left me there.</b>

644
00:52:24,519 --> 00:52:25,630
<b>You looked like me.</b>

645
00:52:27,859 --> 00:52:28,930
<b>I did?</b>

646
00:52:30,630 --> 00:52:32,099
<b>I was abandoned too.</b>

647
00:52:32,970 --> 00:52:35,670
<b>People get abandoned like cats?</b>

648
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:37,700
<b>Four times.</b>

649
00:52:39,170 --> 00:52:41,140
<b>First, my birth parents left me.</b>

650
00:52:42,279 --> 00:52:44,940
<b>Then I was adopted
and returned three times.</b>

651
00:52:47,849 --> 00:52:49,279
<b>You were afraid...</b>

652
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:51,549
<b>of being abandoned again.</b>

653
00:52:52,650 --> 00:52:55,619
<b>Why didn't you tell Sol Ah that?</b>

654
00:52:58,319 --> 00:53:00,990
<b>I told you. I felt ashamed.</b>

655
00:53:02,930 --> 00:53:06,529
<b>"The abandoned kitten
I saw looked like me."</b>

656
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:12,839
<b>It sounds like a playboy's excuse
to avoid a serious relationship.</b>

657
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:14,640
<b>How could I say that?</b>

658
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:17,980
<b>To Sol Ah?</b>

659
00:53:20,180 --> 00:53:23,880
<b>Sol Ah would've given you a hug.</b>

660
00:53:27,289 --> 00:53:29,359
<b>Forget it. Why am I
telling you this?</b>

661
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:38,730
<b>What are you doing?</b>

662
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:49,839
<b>If I were you,
I'd have stayed with Sol Ah.</b>

663
00:53:51,740 --> 00:53:52,779
<b>You?</b>

664
00:53:53,349 --> 00:53:54,669
<b>Even if it means being abandoned.</b>

665
00:53:58,619 --> 00:54:01,990
<b>Being with someone
isn't as easy as it sounds.</b>

666
00:54:03,690 --> 00:54:05,019
<b>Not to mention that...</b>

667
00:54:07,259 --> 00:54:08,630
<b>you're a cat.</b>

668
00:54:14,730 --> 00:54:15,839
<b>- Come on in.
- Welcome.</b>

669
00:54:17,039 --> 00:54:19,740
<b>Is there room for us
to sit together?</b>

670
00:54:20,339 --> 00:54:21,880
<b>Yes. We'll put
a few tables together.</b>

671
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:23,539
<b>Thank you.</b>

672
00:54:24,980 --> 00:54:26,109
<b>Give us a moment.</b>

673
00:54:26,750 --> 00:54:28,980
<b>Oh, dear. You sound very sick.</b>

674
00:54:29,750 --> 00:54:31,250
<b>Okay. Get some rest.</b>

675
00:54:34,450 --> 00:54:37,859
<b>What made the hard-working
Ji Eun take a sick day?</b>

676
00:54:39,230 --> 00:54:41,230
<b>She was fine yesterday.</b>

677
00:54:42,599 --> 00:54:43,900
<b>Give her a call.</b>

678
00:54:45,059 --> 00:54:46,206
<b>Why me?</b>

679
00:54:46,230 --> 00:54:48,700
<b>Sol Ah, you're Ji Eun's best friend.</b>

680
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,640
<b>Shouldn't you
check on her or something?</b>

681
00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:53,339
<b>Yes. You visit her.</b>

682
00:54:53,809 --> 00:54:56,680
<b>Oh... Well,
you see...</b>

683
00:54:57,079 --> 00:54:58,779
<b>It's my mom's death anniversary.</b>

684
00:54:59,049 --> 00:55:01,380
<b>Oh, right. It's around
this time of the year.</b>

685
00:55:02,519 --> 00:55:03,650
<b>Will you spend it alone?</b>

686
00:55:14,529 --> 00:55:15,506
<b>Will you order?</b>

687
00:55:15,530 --> 00:55:17,606
<b>An americano and an orange juice.</b>

688
00:55:17,630 --> 00:55:18,730
<b>Oh, no.</b>

689
00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:37,119
<b>Can I go now?</b>

690
00:55:37,779 --> 00:55:40,750
<b>Will you be okay? You must be tired.</b>

691
00:55:43,059 --> 00:55:45,759
<b>If you fall asleep outside
and turn into a cat...</b>

692
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:52,600
<b>Do you know where they sell peaches?</b>

693
00:56:15,150 --> 00:56:16,460
<b>Hi, Jae Seon.</b>

694
00:56:17,319 --> 00:56:20,490
<b>I'm sorry, but...</b>

695
00:56:21,029 --> 00:56:22,730
<b>is Bang Guk Bong there?</b>

696
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,630
<b>He left. It's been a while.</b>

697
00:56:24,859 --> 00:56:27,670
<b>Oh, really? Then why...</b>

698
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:30,740
<b>Did he get lost?</b>

699
00:56:31,039 --> 00:56:33,640
<b>His important plans were with you.</b>

700
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:38,880
<b>If he comes back, give me a call.</b>

701
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:41,079
<b>Sorry.</b>

702
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:44,349
<b>He doesn't have a phone
and it's inconvenient.</b>

703
00:56:46,549 --> 00:56:48,019
<b>Where are you meeting him?</b>

704
00:56:48,190 --> 00:56:49,390
<b>(Yugwasu Supermarket)</b>

705
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:53,160
<b>Do you have peaches?</b>

706
00:56:53,390 --> 00:56:54,789
<b>Do you have peaches?</b>

707
00:56:55,130 --> 00:56:56,430
<b>Not in this market.</b>

708
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:05,569
<b>Do you have peaches?</b>

709
00:57:05,809 --> 00:57:09,180
<b>Not here. Try the large
supermarket over there.</b>

710
00:58:26,049 --> 00:58:27,150
<b>Lee Jae Seon.</b>

711
00:58:28,089 --> 00:58:29,589
<b>What are you doing here?</b>

712
00:58:30,289 --> 00:58:31,359
<b>Can't I be here?</b>

713
00:58:35,259 --> 00:58:36,799
<b>Why did you bring flowers?</b>

714
00:58:39,869 --> 00:58:41,329
<b>It's for your mother.</b>

715
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:46,269
<b>You remembered?</b>

716
00:58:51,039 --> 00:58:52,039
<b>Thanks.</b>

717
00:58:59,349 --> 00:59:01,390
<b>No. I must hang in there.</b>

718
00:59:09,730 --> 00:59:10,730
<b>Where's Bang Guk Bong?</b>

719
00:59:12,630 --> 00:59:13,769
<b>He's not coming.</b>

720
00:59:29,650 --> 00:59:31,549
<b>Did something happen to him?</b>

721
00:59:40,930 --> 00:59:42,900
<b>Is there a reason he must come?</b>

722
00:59:44,900 --> 00:59:46,269
<b>Not really.</b>

723
00:59:47,430 --> 00:59:49,000
<b>Then why are you waiting?</b>

724
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:53,009
<b>I don't know.
Why am I waiting for him?</b>

725
00:59:55,339 --> 00:59:57,309
<b>Jae Seon's right next to me.</b>

726
01:00:05,650 --> 01:00:10,059
<b>For some strange reason,
I'm not at all pleased or excited.</b>

727
01:00:10,289 --> 01:00:11,859
<b>Someone who cares for her.</b>

728
01:00:12,829 --> 01:00:15,130
<b>What he said bothered me because...</b>

729
01:00:16,430 --> 01:00:18,200
<b>I live with her.</b>

730
01:00:20,269 --> 01:00:23,069
<b>The person I'm waiting for is...</b>

731
01:00:25,299 --> 01:00:26,369
<b>Let's get going.</b>

732
01:00:32,450 --> 01:00:33,910
<b>I think I can manage.</b>

733
01:00:35,950 --> 01:00:38,119
<b>- Manage what?
- Being friends.</b>

734
01:00:41,390 --> 01:00:42,390
<b>I think...</b>

735
01:00:43,519 --> 01:00:44,619
<b>I can manage...</b>

736
01:00:46,460 --> 01:00:48,589
<b>to be friends with you.</b>

737
01:01:19,460 --> 01:01:20,690
<b>I have to get there.</b>

738
01:01:48,220 --> 01:01:51,259
<b>(Sliced peaches)</b>

739
01:02:09,009 --> 01:02:10,279
<b>Sorry for misunderstanding...</b>

740
01:02:13,950 --> 01:02:14,980
<b>I apologize.</b>

741
01:02:15,349 --> 01:02:17,079
<b>No. It happens.</b>

742
01:02:17,849 --> 01:02:18,880
<b>Thank you.</b>

743
01:02:26,259 --> 01:02:28,589
<b>Is that guy a cat too?</b>

744
01:02:30,299 --> 01:02:31,759
<b>He keeps making me sneeze.</b>

745
01:02:42,579 --> 01:02:44,740
<b>- He smells like a cat.
- He does?</b>

746
01:02:46,549 --> 01:02:48,579
<b>Then is he, like you...</b>

747
01:02:48,980 --> 01:02:50,220
<b>It's not just one.</b>

748
01:03:18,710 --> 01:03:21,785
<b>(Welcome)</b>

749
01:03:21,809 --> 01:03:23,549
<b>Sorry for not keeping my promise.</b>

750
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:26,126
<b>- Did something happen?
- I wanted to come to you.</b>

751
01:03:26,150 --> 01:03:27,720
<b>Does he make you that nervous?</b>

752
01:03:27,819 --> 01:03:29,795
<b>He promised to be with me.</b>

753
01:03:29,819 --> 01:03:31,265
<b>He must feel uncomfortable.</b>

754
01:03:31,289 --> 01:03:33,059
<b>He was crying.</b>

755
01:03:33,259 --> 01:03:35,335
<b>- I'll watch on my own.
- What do you mean?</b>

756
01:03:35,359 --> 01:03:36,575
<b>I think someone took him.</b>

757
01:03:36,599 --> 01:03:38,376
<b>I'm nothing without Sol Ah,</b>

758
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:39,745
<b>and I said I'd be with her.</b>

759
01:03:39,769 --> 01:03:40,845
<b>Guess what my nightmare is.</b>

760
01:03:40,869 --> 01:03:43,240
<b>I ask questions
but no one answers them.</b>

761
01:03:44,099 --> 01:03:45,369
<b>Then they all disappear.</b>
