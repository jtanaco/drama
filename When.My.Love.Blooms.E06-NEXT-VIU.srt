<b>What about his family?</b>

324
00:23:13,954 --> 00:23:17,024
<b>His father works at a steel company in Incheon.</b>

325
00:23:17,393 --> 00:23:19,393
<b>He's one of the hardcore labor union members.</b>

326
00:23:21,664 --> 00:23:24,234
<b>He comes from an unusual bloodline.</b>

327

<b>His mother sells fish at a small market store.</b>

328
00:23:27,934 --> 00:23:30,303
<b>He's the typical son of a poor urban family.</b>

329
00:23:30,474 --> 00:23:32,143
<b>I'd say he did pretty well.</b>

330
00:23:32,643 --> 00:23:36,343
<b>Ji Su fell for a terrible fool.</b>

331
00:23:36,643 --> 00:23:39,784
<b>I don't think he's the terrible kind.</b>

332
00:23:40,153 --> 00:23:42,553
<b>He seems more gentle and warm...</b>

333
00:23:42,553 --> 00:23:44,954
<b>That's why he's harder to get rid of.</b>

<b>What's bad now?</b>

337
00:23:56,133 --> 00:23:58,603
<b>The engineering kids were taken in.</b>

342
00:24:06,944 --> 00:24:08,414
<b>He hasn't done anything recently.</b>

<b>Did you start a new group?</b>

345
00:24:16,053 --> 00:24:17,153
<b>Then what is it?</b>

346
00:24:17,924 --> 00:24:19,323
<b>It's not the student union.</b>

347

<b>Your philosophy group?</b>

00:24:22,024 --> 00:24:24,623
<b>Then will we all be taken in?</b>

349
00:24:25,633 --> 00:24:28,234
<b>Why did they suddenly target him?</b>

350
00:24:28,234 --> 00:24:30,833
<b>They got the student union and now they want us too.</b>

351
00:24:31,133 --> 00:24:33,133
<b>They could be after all the old protesters.</b>

352
00:24:45,914 --> 00:24:47,083
<b>Did we get the wrong place?</b>

353
00:24:47,853 --> 00:24:50,053
<b>- I'm not sure. Where, then? - Darn it.</b>

<b>It doesn't suit me, right?</b>

356

<b>Like in a studio for the test takers?</b>

<b>I can't afford it.</b>

361
00:25:26,393 --> 00:25:28,893
<b>And I want to spend some time where there's no TV or computer.</b>

<b>I'll cook and do laundry for you.</b>

<b>Goodness.</b>

368
00:25:38,974 --> 00:25:41,474
<b>Why would you cook for someone like me with your talented hands?</b>

369

<b>It's not like I'm fighting for our independence.</b>

<b>Until I'm not wanted anymore?</b>

481

<b>Didn't you hear?</b>

497
00:35:20,534 --> 00:35:22,204
<b>He went to study for the bar.</b>

498
00:35:22,374 --> 00:35:23,974
<b>Where did he go?</b>

499
00:35:24,474 --> 00:35:25,914
<b>To a temple in the mountain.</b>

500
00:35:27,814 --> 00:35:29,385
<b>He did tell you the truth about that.</b>

501
00:35:29,985 --> 00:35:33,184
<b>If he finds out I talked about this, he'd kill me. Darn it.</b>

<b>Why?</b>

504
00:35:42,465 --> 00:35:44,295
<b>A while ago, he became a wanted man.</b>

505
00:35:44,994 --> 00:35:45,994
<b>Why?</b>

506
00:35:45,994 --> 00:35:48,195
<b>Why do you think? He probably did something wrong.</b>

507
00:35:48,195 --> 00:35:49,905
<b>What did he do wrong?</b>

508
00:35:50,235 --> 00:35:52,104
<b>He formed an organization that benefits our enemy.</b>

509

<b>But Ji Su, I thought about it, but something doesn't add up.</b>

510

<b>It's not like he founded the philosophy club.</b>

511
00:35:59,715 --> 00:36:01,175
<b>He founded a movie club,</b>

512

<b>They can't arrest him for that.</b>

515

<b>You're telling me this...</b>

516

00:45:39,354 --> 00:45:41,595
<b>I didn't study that much at law school,</b>

630
00:45:41,595 --> 00:45:43,365
<b>but I do know that...</b>

631
00:45:43,664 --> 00:45:46,135
<b>no matter how good his lawyer is, you'll still win.</b>

632
00:45:48,764 --> 00:45:51,365
<b>He called it an affair. What I did.</b>

633
00:45:51,865 --> 00:45:52,974
<b>Why would...</b>

634
00:45:55,505 --> 00:45:56,604
<b>Is it...</b>

635
00:45:57,704 --> 00:45:58,744
<b>Jae Hyun?</b>

636
00:46:07,755 --> 00:46:10,655
<b>No, it can't be true.</b>

637
00:46:12,584 --> 00:46:14,755
<b>It's a misunderstanding, right?</b>

638
00:46:16,624 --> 00:46:18,724
<b>Someone took a photo of us together.</b>

639
00:46:21,595 --> 00:46:23,034
<b>But Young Woo,</b>

640
00:46:24,305 --> 00:46:26,575
<b>if having feelings is also considered an affair,</b>

641
00:46:29,175 --> 00:46:31,144
<b>I can't say it isn't true.</b>

642
00:47:00,805 --> 00:47:03,175
<b>(Jae Hyun)</b>

643
00:47:12,045 --> 00:47:14,954
<b>Why on earth do you even want to do this?</b>

644
00:47:15,014 --> 00:47:18,684
<b>I saw it on TV, and it looked fun.</b>

645
00:47:19,854 --> 00:47:21,255
<b>We have an amazing house,</b>

646
00:47:21,255 --> 00:47:23,365
<b>and you want to sleep in that tiny tent?</b>

647
00:47:23,795 --> 00:47:26,164
<b>And why would anyone eat like this?</b>

648
00:47:26,494 --> 00:47:29,135
<b>It's going to be better than any hotel restaurant.</b>

649
00:47:29,365 --> 00:47:31,264
<b>Why are you acting like this?</b>

650
00:47:31,834 --> 00:47:33,405
<b>I didn't want to leave you out.</b>

651
00:47:34,534 --> 00:47:35,604
<b>- Dad! - Yes?</b>

652
00:47:35,604 --> 00:47:37,545
<b>- It's burning. Flip it! - Goodness.</b>

653
00:47:39,474 --> 00:47:40,644
<b>It's quite burnt.</b>

654
00:47:41,445 --> 00:47:43,684
<b>- Will it be okay to eat? - Of course.</b>

655
00:48:10,644 --> 00:48:13,644
<b>If you use this any other way,</b>

656
00:48:13,914 --> 00:48:15,445
<b>I won't let it slide.</b>

657
00:48:15,715 --> 00:48:16,914
<b>Of course.</b>

658
00:48:17,215 --> 00:48:20,954
<b>I will be using it for our goal, only.</b>

659
00:48:23,325 --> 00:48:25,155
<b>I'm saying this to you...</b>

660

<b>out of comradeship and sympathy,</b>

661

<b>but we both are having such a pitiful love life.</b>

662
00:48:34,764 --> 00:48:37,865
<b>This is all out of love, isn't it?</b>

663
00:48:38,305 --> 00:48:39,534
<b>Don't be ridiculous.</b>

664
00:48:40,505 --> 00:48:42,434
<b>Do you think what you're feeling is love?</b>

665
00:48:43,945 --> 00:48:46,445
<b>It doesn't look like it to me.</b>

666
00:48:58,584 --> 00:49:01,454
<b>I've been hearing about you all along.</b>

667
00:49:01,825 --> 00:49:03,724
<b>On the internet and the news.</b>

668
00:49:03,724 --> 00:49:05,865
<b>I'm sure nothing was good.</b>

669
00:49:07,334 --> 00:49:08,994
<b>How have you been?</b>

670
00:49:09,394 --> 00:49:11,434
<b>I quit my job...</b>

671
00:49:11,635 --> 00:49:13,204
<b>and opened up an LP bar.</b>

672
00:49:14,604 --> 00:49:16,075
<b>That's romantic.</b>

673
00:49:16,275 --> 00:49:19,644
<b>I'm single, so I can barely get by.</b>

674
00:49:20,744 --> 00:49:23,244
<b>So you're not married?</b>

675
00:49:27,014 --> 00:49:28,715
<b>Is there any particular reason?</b>

676
00:49:30,584 --> 00:49:32,755
<b>It just turned out that way.</b>

677
00:49:34,255 --> 00:49:37,224
<b>I guess I'm making you uncomfortable.</b>

678
00:49:38,295 --> 00:49:41,735
<b>Well, it's my turn to make you uncomfortable.</b>

679
00:49:43,805 --> 00:49:45,534
<b>It was me.</b>

680

<b>On April Fools' Day.</b>

681

<b>Thanks.</b>

684
00:49:59,615 --> 00:50:01,414
<b>Do you really think it will be okay?</b>

685
00:50:01,655 --> 00:50:03,255
<b>There were a lot of police officers.</b>

686
00:50:03,755 --> 00:50:05,755
<b>That's why I'll be using the streets.</b>

687
00:50:07,055 --> 00:50:08,795
<b>Where are you going?</b>

688

<b>Ji Su...</b>

690
00:50:22,874 --> 00:50:25,144
<b>was having such a hard time between you and her father,</b>

691
00:50:25,704 --> 00:50:27,275
<b>but you seemed so laid-back.</b>

692
00:50:30,144 --> 00:50:31,414
<b>But Ji Su...</b>

693
00:50:32,284 --> 00:50:34,215
<b>was only worried about you,</b>

694
00:50:35,655 --> 00:50:38,584
<b>so I got angry and jealous.</b>

695
00:50:39,724 --> 00:50:42,195
<b>Why are you telling me this now?</b>

696
00:50:43,095 --> 00:50:45,195
<b>I wanted to be open with you.</b>

697
00:50:46,564 --> 00:50:48,394
<b>That way, I can criticize you...</b>

698
00:50:50,034 --> 00:50:51,635
<b>or even ask you a favor.</b>

699
00:50:52,834 --> 00:50:54,275
<b>I already knew, Young Woo.</b>

700
00:50:55,474 --> 00:50:56,905
<b>That you reported me.</b>

701
00:50:59,545 --> 00:51:01,814
<b>So don't feel bad now...</b>

702
00:51:02,014 --> 00:51:03,084
<b>and tell me.</b>

703
00:51:04,284 --> 00:51:06,414
<b>Which one is it today?</b>

704
00:51:08,115 --> 00:51:09,615
<b>A criticism?</b>

705
00:51:10,325 --> 00:51:11,425
<b>Or a favor?</b>

706
00:51:13,624 --> 00:51:14,795
<b>Both.</b>

<b>You must have given it a deep thought. You look sunken.</b>

<b>I've been thinking about it since that day.</b>

750

<b>About why you were doing this.</b>

751
00:56:17,624 --> 00:56:19,894
<b>You were the one who had an affair...</b>

752

<b>before Young Min could even walk.</b>

753

<b>You agreed to give up custody at court...</b>

<b>without giving it a second thought.</b>

<b>Why would you suddenly want it?</b>

756
00:56:33,244 --> 00:56:34,775
<b>Let's just say...</b>

757
00:56:36,115 --> 00:56:38,414
<b>you somehow developed a love for your son.</b>

758
00:56:39,715 --> 00:56:41,184
<b>Then you would have brought up the affair...</b>

<b>and my incompetence at court to win,</b>

<b>but why were you so focused on destroying the man...</b>

00:56:47,025 --> 00:56:49,825
<b>instead of bringing back your son?</b>

762

<b>How can the custody of your child and Han Jae Hyun...</b>

<b>even be comparable?</b>

764

<b>And did you find the answer?</b>

765

<b>My dad once told me about the opportunity cost...</b>

<b>25 years ago.</b>

<b>If you choose one side,</b>

768
00:57:14,914 --> 00:57:16,485
<b>you must give up the other.</b>

769
00:57:18,985 --> 00:57:21,224
<b>You need to choose what you want to do the most...</b>

<b>or avoid what you're most afraid of.</b>
