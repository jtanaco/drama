1
00:00:07,885 --> 00:00:10,750
<i>Episode 13</i>
You all remember.

2
00:00:10,875 --> 00:00:12,364
the first phone call...

3
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:14,710
from Ms. Lee Shin, right?

4
00:00:15,859 --> 00:00:17,329
It was the train derailment.

5
00:00:18,509 --> 00:00:19,589
What are you talking about?

6
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:21,410
They were all alive.

7
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:23,880
What if it wasn't before the reset?

8
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:27,720
But the life before the reset?

9
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:29,549
What?

10
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:32,960
What if she observed us, so she knew
what would happen to us...

11
00:00:33,259 --> 00:00:35,029
in advance?

12
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:46,410
That's right.

13
00:00:47,779 --> 00:00:48,849
All of you...

14
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:50,679
were...

15
00:00:51,589 --> 00:00:53,119
dead before.

16
00:01:18,179 --> 00:01:19,780
It's cozy and nice.

17
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:22,850
I've always wanted to visit.

18
00:01:24,789 --> 00:01:25,990
How long has it been?

19
00:01:27,189 --> 00:01:29,820
Has it been around seven months?

20
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:31,689
Who are you?

21
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:33,689
- Where have you been...
- So?

22
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:35,250
Are you not happy to see me?

23
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:41,870
I'm sure you have many questions.

24
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:44,670
Look, let's hear her out first.

25
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:57,549
What do you mean
by we were dead?

26
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:01,420
During the first five resets,

27
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:04,760
you've all died each time.

28
00:02:05,989 --> 00:02:09,159
But during the sixth,
I decided to save you.

29
00:02:10,829 --> 00:02:14,670
And I've invited you
for the seventh.

30
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:18,239
Didn't we meet for the first time
at Zian Clinic?

31
00:02:18,969 --> 00:02:21,840
So when and how
did you save our lives?

32
00:02:23,109 --> 00:02:25,450
It was actually quite easy.

33
00:02:26,109 --> 00:02:29,420
You just had to avoid the place
on the day of your deaths.

34
00:02:34,989 --> 00:02:38,465
(The elevator is being repaired.)

35
00:02:38,489 --> 00:02:39,665
- Fix it and come on over.
- Okay.

36
00:02:39,689 --> 00:02:40,766
Mr. Choi couldn't go
to the get-together...

37
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:42,190
because he had to fix the elevator.

38
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:52,559
Ms. Seo couldn't go to the park
because her clothes got wet.

39
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,925
Mr. Cha was arrested
for compulsive gambling.

40
00:02:58,949 --> 00:03:00,250
Are you Mr. Cha Jeung Seok?

41
00:03:00,349 --> 00:03:01,349
Where are you taking me?

42
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:05,990
(Handong Logistics)

43
00:03:06,449 --> 00:03:07,620
What happened?

44
00:03:08,389 --> 00:03:11,189
Mr. Park was late to work
because of a flat tire.

45
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,930
Ms. So was out delivering flowers.

46
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:22,139
Flower delivery.

47
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:33,849
You all evaded death.

48
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,436
You saved our lives
through a phone call...

49
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:42,819
and a cup of coffee?

50
00:03:44,729 --> 00:03:46,089
Do you really think we'd buy that?

51
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:49,060
If the fate is already known,

52
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,599
it's easy to change it.

53
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:54,599
You've all experienced it.

54
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:57,039
You saved your once-dead colleague.

55
00:03:57,810 --> 00:03:59,370
You're walking once again.

56
00:04:00,509 --> 00:04:02,539
You didn't need any superpowers,
did you?

57
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:04,909
Then...

58
00:04:05,849 --> 00:04:07,080
what about us?

59
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,520
How did you save us?

60
00:04:16,659 --> 00:04:17,960
I'm not sure.

61
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:22,300
How did I save you again?

62
00:04:26,469 --> 00:04:28,039
What's wrong with you?

63
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,770
What grudge do you have against us?

64
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:34,210
I don't have any resentment
against you.

65
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:36,840
I just have a lot of time.

66
00:04:43,479 --> 00:04:44,620
I was curious...

67
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:48,419
whether fate...

68
00:04:49,819 --> 00:04:51,289
was destined...

69
00:04:51,889 --> 00:04:53,529
or changeable.

70
00:04:55,899 --> 00:04:57,660
That's why I carried out
this experiment.

71
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:01,216
I wondered how things would pan out
if I saved those who were...

72
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,320
meant to die and convinced them
to reset their lives.

73
00:05:04,069 --> 00:05:06,769
I even gave you hints
by sending those bouquets.

74
00:05:07,209 --> 00:05:08,615
Are our lives a joke to you?

75
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,480
- Detective Ji.
- Calm down, Detective Ji.

76
00:05:12,509 --> 00:05:13,750
You don't have much time.

77
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:16,490
Do you want to spend what's
left of your time as an assailant?

78
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,189
Darn it!

79
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:28,000
Let me go!

80
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:30,500
Let me go!

81
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:32,300
Let me go!

82
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:34,569
Aren't you all curious...

83
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:37,769
when, where, and how you'll die?

84
00:05:40,209 --> 00:05:42,910
If you're a bit more polite,
I could tell you.

85
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:44,980
"Polite"?

86
00:05:47,209 --> 00:05:48,350
Did you say, "polite"?

87
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,420
And what's your definition of that?

88
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:53,696
Do you expect us to beg
and be willing to do anything...

89
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,160
like an animal being dragged
into a slaughterhouse?

90
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,529
If that's what you want to see,

91
00:05:59,129 --> 00:06:01,399
you will never get what you want.

92
00:06:08,269 --> 00:06:10,899
I wonder if you can be
this confident until the end.

93
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:16,079
The next victim...

94
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:21,850
will die a gruesome death.

95
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:35,199
Don't be too scared.

96
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:38,846
I still have hope...

97
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:42,000
that you can change your fates.

98
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:58,250
You're going to get even busier.

99
00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:04,519
Stop right there. Stop!

100
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:05,930
Stop!

101
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,129
Detective Ji.

102
00:08:07,589 --> 00:08:09,389
Do you think there's a way
to win against her?

103
00:08:11,259 --> 00:08:13,189
We'll either tremble in fear
and die...

104
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:15,560
or save ourselves by begging.

105
00:08:17,259 --> 00:08:19,899
Either way, it'll be what she wants.

106
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,290
I'm sure there's a way.

107
00:08:44,589 --> 00:08:46,129
I'm positive.

108
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:51,629
The next victim...

109
00:08:51,769 --> 00:08:54,600
will die a gruesome death.

110
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:00,540
Did you find him?

111
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:05,055
He neither emigrated nor died,

112
00:09:05,079 --> 00:09:06,980
so why can't you find him?

113
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,549
Come on.

114
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:18,590

Ji Hyeong Ju.

126
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,490
What's on your mind?
I just called you.

127
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:55,597
Hey.

128
00:10:55,621 --> 00:10:57,090
Someone's here to see you.

129
00:10:57,659 --> 00:10:58,636
Who?

130
00:10:58,660 --> 00:10:59,990
(Seoul Makang Police Station)

131
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:17,909
It's him, isn't he?

132
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:21,879
He's that senior you saved.

133
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:23,179
Why are you here?

134
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:31,120
You're the one who should tell me.

135
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:34,460
Don't you have any questions for me?

136
00:11:35,129 --> 00:11:36,759
A detective of Violent Crimes.

137
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:39,330
That's a dangerous job.

138
00:11:41,029 --> 00:11:44,169
And for people like you,
it can be threatening.

139
00:11:46,309 --> 00:11:47,470
I know.

140
00:11:48,169 --> 00:11:50,980
I'm sure you want to find something
and put those handcuffs on me.

141
00:11:52,009 --> 00:11:54,610
I hope you do that before you die.

142
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:04,690
I clearly said...

143
00:12:06,029 --> 00:12:09,000
the next person who dies
will die a gruesome death.

144
00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:12,600
Don't you want to know who it'll be?

145
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,340
Your plan is evident.

146
00:12:17,539 --> 00:12:20,269
You'll want to control me
with a few words I can't confirm.

147
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:23,809
I won't let you do that anymore.

148
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:30,019
In that case,

149
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,220
you'll have to do better.

150
00:12:34,789 --> 00:12:36,960
You don't have much time left.

151
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:50,299
I put a tail on Ms. Song.

152
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:59,909
I don't know why all of you
gather at Zian Clinic...

153
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:02,596
or why you're dying one at a time.

154
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:04,019
But what I do know...

155
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:07,289
is that Lee Shin is capable
of anything.

156
00:13:07,389 --> 00:13:09,096
It's as if she knows the future.

157
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,436
She knew everything about me.

158
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:13,666
Are you suggesting that
she had been putting on a show?

159
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:17,005
She might have done as she's told
because Lee Shin knows her weakness.

160
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:19,275
Anyway, ever since
Ms. Lee Shin came to the cafe,

161
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:21,669
Ms. Song had been very busy too.

162
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:29,686
What about this? What's this?

163
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:31,710
Right here. Take a closer look.

164
00:13:32,179 --> 00:13:33,979
It's a law firm called
Park and Park Law Firm.

165
00:13:34,009 --> 00:13:36,480
They're the best and the most
expensive attorneys in Korea.

166
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:39,720
Is she preparing
for a fight in the court?

167
00:13:42,759 --> 00:13:44,490
There is something I'm suspecting.

168
00:13:46,629 --> 00:13:48,166
(Seoul Makang Police Station)

169
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:50,000
When can we have the result?

170
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,899
All right. Thank you.

171
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:56,745
- Is that for Bae Jung Tae?
- Yes. You were right.

172
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:58,046
He applied for parole.

173
00:13:58,070 --> 00:13:59,846
- When is the evaluation?
- Next week.

174
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:01,586
You know Attorney Park Won Jun
of Park and Park Law Firm, right?

175
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:03,255
He specializes in paroles.

176
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:05,649
He'll be 100 percent approved
if he has Park on his side.

177
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:10,610
Anyway, why do you suddenly
want to know about Bae Jung Tae?

178
00:14:11,049 --> 00:14:14,666
I clearly said the next person
who dies will die a gruesome death.

179
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:16,759
You don't have much time left.

180
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:19,659
Thanks for looking into it.

181
00:14:20,029 --> 00:14:22,000
Hey, Hyeong Ju...

182
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,100
What's with him?

183
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:27,105
Bae Jung Tae will be released soon.

184
00:14:27,129 --> 00:14:28,230
Already?

185
00:14:28,669 --> 00:14:29,669
Here.

186
00:14:30,039 --> 00:14:32,610
(Apply for a visit)

187
00:14:32,769 --> 00:14:34,970
Mr. Bae Jung Tae is
unable to see you today.

188
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:36,639
He's meeting someone else.

189
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:37,909
What?

190
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:43,950
You kept refusing to see me.

191
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:45,566
Why did you call?

192
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:47,090
Choi Min Ho.

193
00:14:47,889 --> 00:14:49,559
You haven't found him, have you?

194
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:52,289
He's pretty difficult to find.

195
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:56,436
It was really tough for me
to find him too.

196
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:58,259
You haven't found him to this day,

197
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:00,570
but you found him
while you were stuck here?

198
00:15:01,769 --> 00:15:04,500
- Do you expect me to believe that?
- I don't care if you do.

199
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:07,669
What's important is the fact.

200
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,655
I have Choi Min Ho in my hands now.

201
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:15,649
But over the last seven months,

202
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,056
my pricing for information
went up a little.

203
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,820
Are you asking for money again?

204
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:21,666
How much more do you need...

205
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:23,090
I don't need money.

206
00:15:24,059 --> 00:15:26,389
I need you to help me
with something else.

207
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:29,600
Se Rin...

208
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:33,000
Ga Hyeon.

209
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:34,370
What's wrong?

210
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:39,669
Why were you at Zian Clinic?

211
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:41,840
Did you meet with Ms. Lee Shin?

212
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:44,110
Yes.

213
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:47,210
Why? What did she say?

214
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:50,080
You came much later than I expected.

215
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:54,090
I thought you would
come running first.

216
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:57,336
Can you just tell me...

217
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,490
when I'll die?

218
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:05,330
If you want to know something,

219
00:16:06,769 --> 00:16:08,429
you'll have to pay the price.

220
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:13,916
But I don't want anything.

221
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,379
As you know,

222
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,210
I already have a lot.

223
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:25,120
What I need is...

224
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:27,649
fun.

225
00:16:38,059 --> 00:16:40,799
She told me who'll die next.

226
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:46,639
When and how that person will die.

227
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,655
- What?
- She said she'll let me live...

228
00:16:50,679 --> 00:16:52,279
if I let that person die.

229
00:16:52,779 --> 00:16:54,750
She told me to choose...

230
00:16:55,649 --> 00:16:58,149
either to save that person
or save myself.

231
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:02,019
What should I do, Ga Hyeon?

232
00:17:03,259 --> 00:17:04,289
Who is it?

233
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:06,460
Who's that person?

234
00:17:15,669 --> 00:17:16,700
Was it me?

235
00:17:22,909 --> 00:17:24,009
Tell me.

236
00:17:25,549 --> 00:17:27,049
Did she say I'll die next?

237
00:17:28,409 --> 00:17:30,179
Yes, Ga Hyeon.

238
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,389
When?

239
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:35,820
Where?

240
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:38,860
How will I die?

241
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:43,200
Stop crying and start talking!

242
00:17:52,069 --> 00:17:54,809
(Shin Ga Hyeon)

243
00:17:57,579 --> 00:17:59,055
(Shin Ga Hyeon)

244
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:00,150
(You have 7 missed calls.)

245
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,180
(Kim Se Rin)

246
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:09,259
(Kim Se Rin)

247
00:18:12,329 --> 00:18:13,359
Ms. Lee.

248
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:15,140
It looks like
you had a good talk with her.

249
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,636
- Great job.
- Wait, Ms. Lee.

250
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:18,900
Don't worry.

251
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:23,170
I always keep my promises.

252
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:34,860
Should I escort her
to the counseling room?

253
00:18:35,619 --> 00:18:37,950
It's way too late
for a counseling session.

254
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:42,160
This is fun.
Let's keep watching her.

255
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:44,559
Open the door.

256
00:18:48,029 --> 00:18:49,359
Open the door.

257
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:51,200
Please open this door.

258
00:18:52,569 --> 00:18:54,329
Will you please open this door?

259
00:18:54,599 --> 00:18:56,099
I know you're in there.

260
00:18:56,569 --> 00:18:58,299
You're lying again, aren't you?

261
00:18:58,599 --> 00:19:00,839
You're experimenting with us again!

262
00:19:01,069 --> 00:19:02,755
Open this door!

263
00:19:02,779 --> 00:19:05,849
What about your appointment
with the professor?

264
00:19:09,549 --> 00:19:11,150
I'll call.

265
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:22,900
Please!

266
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:25,329
Please.

267
00:19:26,369 --> 00:19:27,430
Please.

268
00:19:27,869 --> 00:19:29,146
Please...

269
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:30,569
The next person will...

270
00:19:31,269 --> 00:19:34,339
die a gruesome death.

271
00:19:35,069 --> 00:19:38,539
Please. Please open this door.

272
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,519
Stop lying.

273
00:19:43,019 --> 00:19:45,619
You're lying, aren't you?

274
00:19:48,519 --> 00:19:49,920
Gosh, it's freezing.

275
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,730
Man, are you working at home too?

276
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:09,356
- Let's eat.
- I'm not in the mood to drink.

277
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:11,940
That's exactly
when you should drink.

278
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:13,250
Here.

279
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:27,370
I heard
Bae Jung Tae will be released.

280
00:20:28,759 --> 00:20:31,960
That jerk must have
some affluent person behind him...

281
00:20:32,029 --> 00:20:34,069
to have Park and Park Law Firm
work for him.

282
00:20:36,539 --> 00:20:37,970
How's your leg?

283
00:20:38,839 --> 00:20:40,569
My legs still hurt.

284
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,940
They hurt even more whenever
you cause trouble. It hurts now.

285
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,990
Anyway, it's not like
this is the first time we got hurt.

286
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:52,580
We need to quit Violent Crimes
if we get scared of that.

287
00:20:57,819 --> 00:20:58,890
You're right.

288
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:01,990
You live knowing you'll die one day.

289
00:21:02,599 --> 00:21:04,799
You work as a detective
knowing you'll get hurt.

290
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:08,599
That's how I lived to this day.

291
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,740
Why am I suddenly scared?

292
00:21:15,309 --> 00:21:17,109
Did I think I'm invincible?

293
00:21:19,849 --> 00:21:21,509
Everyone is like that.

294
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,626
It seems like
death is for everyone else.

295
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:26,720
You feel like
death might just pass you by.

296
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:28,859
That's how you could live.

297
00:21:29,259 --> 00:21:32,259
If you worry about death every day,
that's barely living.

298
00:21:46,609 --> 00:21:48,269
Why are you suddenly so serious?

299
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,640
You aren't even drunk.

300
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,680
Here.

301
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:22,775
(Koo Seung Min)

302
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:25,670
(Missed calls:
Koo Seung Min, Kim Se Rin)

303
00:23:45,319 --> 00:23:46,460
Is it Bae Jung Tae?

304
00:23:46,859 --> 00:23:48,505
Is that why
you reappeared after seven months?

305
00:23:48,529 --> 00:23:50,859
Why do you think so?

306
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:53,376
If not, there's no way
you'd give him...

307
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,440
the best law firm in Korea
to get him out on parole.

308
00:23:57,670 --> 00:24:00,940
I knew it.
You really are a detective.

309
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:04,710
Is Bae Jung Tae
related to the death...

310
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,509
of the next person?

311
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:09,319
You have a lot of questions.

312
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:13,490
I thought there was
nothing you want to hear from me.

313
00:24:13,849 --> 00:24:15,859
You said you won't
let me fool you anymore.

314
00:24:18,119 --> 00:24:20,559
If you're scheming something
with a petty criminal like Bae,

315
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:22,960
then you'll never get me.

316
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:24,660
Detective Ji.

317
00:24:26,099 --> 00:24:29,140
You should be thanking me.

318
00:24:31,369 --> 00:24:33,170
I'm paying...

319
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:35,940
for the mistake you made.

320
00:24:38,609 --> 00:24:40,049
What are you talking about?

321
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:45,319
Well, it's not like
a detective is a deity.

322
00:24:46,349 --> 00:24:47,750
You could always make a mistake.

323
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:50,359
Don't be so hard on yourself.

324
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,400
Yes?

325
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,269
I'm sorry.

326
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:08,609
I'm expecting an important guest.

327
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:21,450
Ga Hyeon.

328
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:23,789
Why are you here?

329
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:28,059
I'll tell you later.

330
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:45,210
Was there an emergency last night?

331
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:49,680
Why were you looking for me
so desperately?

332
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:56,420
Is there a way for me to live?

333
00:25:59,059 --> 00:26:00,930
If I do as you say,

334
00:26:02,759 --> 00:26:04,575
could I really live?

335
00:26:04,599 --> 00:26:06,000
Of course.

336
00:26:09,069 --> 00:26:11,670
Only if you ask politely.

337
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,980
What do I have to do in return?

338
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:23,279
We'll have to
think about that together.

339
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:26,650
I think...

340
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:31,019
things will be even more fun
with you, Ga Hyeon.

341
00:26:32,789 --> 00:26:34,490
We still have a lot of time.

342
00:26:37,059 --> 00:26:39,099
You said I'm next.

343
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:43,900
Who said that?

344
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,940
- I never said that.
- What kind of a joke is this?

345
00:26:48,109 --> 00:26:49,609
I'm not joking.

346
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:53,450
It means someone is lying.

347
00:26:56,349 --> 00:26:58,150
Who do you think is...

348
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,319
lying?

What's wrong?

351
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:34,619
I heard I'll be next,

352
00:27:35,349 --> 00:27:37,190
that I'll die next.

353
00:27:38,089 --> 00:27:39,666
But it was a lie.

Why are you calling her?

Se Rin.

358
00:28:09,619 --> 00:28:10,859
Se Rin, are you home?

359
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:12,990
Who are you?

360
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:18,029
Are you looking for Se Rin?

361
00:28:20,769 --> 00:28:22,799
Are you her friend?

362
00:28:23,369 --> 00:28:24,916
Can you reach her right now?

363
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:26,009
I'm her sister.

364
00:28:26,309 --> 00:28:29,279
Mom said she couldn't reach her,
so I came by. Is she not at home?

365
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:30,940
You... You're her sister?

366
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:34,480
- Her biological sister?
- Yes.

367
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,295
I was the weakling,

368
00:28:37,319 --> 00:28:38,726
but my older sister
passed away first.

369
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:40,166
It was the same way
your friend passed away.

370
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:41,565
She got into a car accident.

371
00:28:41,589 --> 00:28:44,390
She tried to save me
but got hit by the car instead.

372
00:28:44,859 --> 00:28:46,829
Are you really her older sister?

373
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:50,730
This time, did she say I died?

374
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:56,670
If she's not here, she's probably
at the club room of her university.

375
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,500
Her university?

376
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,210
Isn't she a repeater?

377
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,710
I can't believe this.

Oh, the terminally ill one?

381
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:12,950
"Terminally ill"?

382
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:17,890
She lied to Young Woong saying
she's terminally ill, got caught,

383
00:29:18,019 --> 00:29:19,960
and created huge chaos.

384
00:29:20,329 --> 00:29:23,000
She does look
pretty feeble and weak.

385
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:24,505
She fooled us too.

386
00:29:24,529 --> 00:29:27,529
Young Woong is going to the army
because of her too.

a good talk with her. Great job.

399

I advise you to get out of Seoul.

when I was abandoned
in front of an orphanage.

She's buying people's sympathy
by lying to them.

422
00:32:53,419 --> 00:32:56,159
She thinks
that's how people will love her.

He just left his phone.

can you talk to the detective?

Can you ask him to find Young Woong?
Please?

Why did you lie to me?

442
00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:31,789
Don't believe what she told you.

443
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:34,566
She has a lot of problems,

444
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:35,996
so she used to go
to therapy and stuff.

445
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:37,490
You were the one who had therapy.

446

You said you were retaking the CSAT
and your parents hated you.

00:34:52,470 --> 00:34:55,009
taking my sister's word over mine?

450
00:34:57,139 --> 00:34:58,850
Okay. Fine.

454
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:09,060
Can you...

455
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:14,129
ask the detective to find him?
Please?

456
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:16,100
Please, Ga Hyeon.

is at the police station.

00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:27,870
What?

460
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:35,680
You are here...

461
00:35:36,319 --> 00:35:37,980
to report Ms. Kim Se Rin?

462
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:45,165
That makes no sense.
Why would he do that?

463
00:35:45,189 --> 00:35:47,589
I thought about letting this go
until I joined the military.

464
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:52,470
But after finding out that
she downloaded a tracking app,

465
00:35:53,399 --> 00:35:54,545
I couldn't let it slide anymore.

466
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:56,646
I only did that
because I was worried about him.

467
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:59,286
She threatened me that she'd
kill herself if I broke up with her.

468
00:35:59,310 --> 00:36:00,516
I'm sick of it now.

469
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:03,956
I really can't live
without him, Ga Hyeon.

470
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:06,125
It has to be that house.

471
00:36:06,149 --> 00:36:08,850
I should have known
when she moved next door to mine.

472
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:11,326
I found out she approached me
with a plan.

473
00:36:11,350 --> 00:36:13,420
Why do you think
I went through the reset?

474
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:16,220
I've done a lot of things
to meet Young Woong.

475
00:36:19,990 --> 00:36:21,490
I can't give up like this.

476
00:36:22,329 --> 00:36:24,029
Over my dead body. I can't.

477
00:36:30,139 --> 00:36:32,439
Will you say you did this
because of Young Woong?

478
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,139
Are you sure you can do anything?

479
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,480
Yes.

480
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:41,949
Who do you think is next?

481
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:51,120
Next up...

482
00:36:52,889 --> 00:36:53,959
is you.

483
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:10,740
How does it feel?

484
00:37:11,579 --> 00:37:12,680
Aren't you scared?

485
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:17,980
Well, all of you will die anyway.

486
00:37:18,350 --> 00:37:19,949
But being the next one to die...

487
00:37:21,189 --> 00:37:23,389
must terrify you.

488
00:37:24,089 --> 00:37:25,930
And if someone else gets terrified,

489
00:37:26,730 --> 00:37:28,699
that will be
such good entertainment for me.

490
00:37:32,970 --> 00:37:34,730
You choose, Se Rin.

491
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:37,899
To whom must you say this
to entertain me?

492
00:37:39,209 --> 00:37:43,209
And think about what you should say
to make it more fun.

493
00:37:44,279 --> 00:37:45,810
Then, I'll tell you...

494
00:37:47,410 --> 00:37:49,649
how you can save yourself.

495
00:38:04,129 --> 00:38:05,230
Why did you do it?

496
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:09,839
Why was it me?

497
00:38:09,899 --> 00:38:11,600
You would have done the same.

498
00:38:11,769 --> 00:38:13,740
The person you're closest to.

499
00:38:14,269 --> 00:38:15,980
The person who will not doubt you.

500
00:38:16,939 --> 00:38:18,555
You'd probably choose
that kind of person.

501
00:38:18,579 --> 00:38:20,656
You... How could you?

502
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:21,855
Don't resent me.

503
00:38:21,879 --> 00:38:23,750
You're scared of dying too.

504
00:38:24,379 --> 00:38:27,189
You were at ease when
you found out it wasn't your turn.

505
00:38:28,189 --> 00:38:29,220
So...

506
00:38:30,790 --> 00:38:32,829
did Ms. Lee Shin tell you?

507
00:38:33,029 --> 00:38:36,300
Did you sell me out
and save yourself?

508
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,029
Yes.

509
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,500
That's why I'm grateful to you.

510
00:38:43,899 --> 00:38:46,110
Since I'm grateful to you,
let me ask one more favor.

511
00:38:47,370 --> 00:38:48,879
Tell the detective...

512
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,980
to just send Young Woong home.

513
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:53,610
(Complaint, Choi Young Woong)

514
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:55,850
(Defendant: Kim Se Rin)

515
00:38:56,879 --> 00:38:59,096
(Plaintiff: Choi Young Woong,
Presenter: Ji Hyeong Ju)

516
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:02,019
(Complaint, Choi Young Woong)

517
00:39:04,419 --> 00:39:05,590
It's all done now.

518
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:08,399
Detective Ji.

519
00:39:09,799 --> 00:39:11,629
I have something to tell you.

520
00:39:15,299 --> 00:39:16,639
I started...

521
00:39:17,399 --> 00:39:19,840
to date Se Rin
after the assault incident.

522
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:22,240
But now that I look back on it,

523
00:39:22,679 --> 00:39:24,440
something was strange about that.

524
00:39:26,009 --> 00:39:28,419
Unless you want me to go crazy,

525
00:39:28,549 --> 00:39:30,220
call him now!

526
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:33,750
Kim Se Rin.

527
00:39:38,490 --> 00:39:40,066
Do you know
where I should cut myself,

528
00:39:40,090 --> 00:39:41,690
so I don't die and just get hurt?

529
00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:44,129
I know it very well...

530
00:39:44,759 --> 00:39:46,330
because I needed that often.

531
00:39:53,039 --> 00:39:55,639
If you don't want to end up
like Bae Jung Tae, call him!

532
00:39:57,909 --> 00:40:00,850
"Bae Jung Tae"? What do you mean?

533
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:04,950
Tell me! What do you mean by that?

534
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:15,659
That man asked her,

535
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:18,200
"What are you trying to pull?"

536
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:22,570
Who are you?
What are you trying to pull?

537
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,740
No matter how many times
I thought about it,

538
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:27,570
it sounded strange to me.

539
00:40:32,909 --> 00:40:33,980
Are you saying...

540
00:40:35,779 --> 00:40:37,019
it was all your doing?

541
00:40:37,379 --> 00:40:40,289
Yes. It was me.

542
00:40:41,519 --> 00:40:43,519
You and the police...

543
00:40:44,659 --> 00:40:46,690
were all fooled by me.

544
00:40:51,830 --> 00:40:53,769
Who'd believe an ex-convict?

545
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:57,240
Like I expected,
everyone believed me...

546
00:40:58,299 --> 00:41:00,145
and put him behind bars.

547
00:41:00,169 --> 00:41:01,340
Kim Se Rin.

548
00:41:02,679 --> 00:41:04,039
Do you think you're an exception?

549
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:06,009
(Koo Seung Min)

550
00:41:28,539 --> 00:41:32,370
Ms. Shin, are you in there?
Ms. Shin!

551
00:41:34,309 --> 00:41:35,409
Ms. Shin?

552
00:41:37,879 --> 00:41:39,009
Who... Who are you?

553
00:41:41,049 --> 00:41:43,149
Ms. Shin. Ms. Shin.

554
00:41:45,889 --> 00:41:48,860
Ms. Shin, you're bleeding.
Are you okay?

555
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:52,389
Oh, no. You're bleeding.
What should I do?

556
00:42:07,610 --> 00:42:09,610
I'm so upset.

557
00:42:11,309 --> 00:42:13,309
Shouldn't you report this
to the police?

558
00:42:14,149 --> 00:42:15,350
Seung Min.

559
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:18,450
I'm sorry,

560
00:42:20,549 --> 00:42:22,389
but I'd like to be alone.

561
00:42:23,519 --> 00:42:24,860
Ms. Shin.

562
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:27,090
Please.

563
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:31,860
All right.

564
00:42:33,129 --> 00:42:34,330
I'll be going, then.

565
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:52,820
Thank you, Ga Hyeon.

566
00:42:56,190 --> 00:42:57,750
It must be pretty tough
because of that.

567
00:42:59,289 --> 00:43:01,330
You always have to be the best.

568
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:05,129
You always have to
live up to other people's standards.

569
00:43:07,899 --> 00:43:09,100
Cheers.

570
00:43:43,970 --> 00:43:44,970
That was out of the blue.

571
00:43:48,169 --> 00:43:50,779
I wonder why...

572
00:43:50,909 --> 00:43:53,909
you've suddenly become curious
about that.

573
00:43:57,350 --> 00:43:59,950
Whom did Kim Se Rin betray
this time around?

574
00:44:02,419 --> 00:44:05,320
I know I'm late, but I'm willing
to listen to the truth now.

575
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,129
"The truth"?

576
00:44:15,269 --> 00:44:16,870
I like that
you decided on this quickly.

577
00:44:17,039 --> 00:44:18,570
What do you need me to do?

578
00:44:18,639 --> 00:44:20,539
It may be difficult.

579
00:44:21,039 --> 00:44:22,639
You may not understand.

580
00:44:25,110 --> 00:44:27,779
But I'll make sure...

581
00:44:28,149 --> 00:44:29,669
to compensate handsomely
for your work.

582
00:44:29,980 --> 00:44:31,080
You have my word.

583
00:44:34,950 --> 00:44:36,519
I want you to keep an eye on Se Rin.

584
00:44:37,889 --> 00:44:39,129
Kim Se Rin?

585
00:44:39,289 --> 00:44:42,159
She suffers
from an anxiety disorder.

586
00:44:43,129 --> 00:44:46,830
She's unpredictable.

587
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:50,539
I'm just worried...

588
00:44:53,769 --> 00:44:56,840
she might die.

589
00:44:57,009 --> 00:44:59,879
Back then, I didn't understand
what she meant.

590
00:45:00,110 --> 00:45:01,580
But now, I do.

591
00:45:02,649 --> 00:45:05,466
She was worried
Se Rin would self-harm...

592
00:45:05,490 --> 00:45:06,990
and end up dying.

593
00:45:08,860 --> 00:45:11,090
I beg you.

594
00:45:11,759 --> 00:45:14,789
The other students
feel uncomfortable about this.

595
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,700
I'm grateful that you like me,
but let's just stay as friends.

596
00:45:20,070 --> 00:45:21,100
Why?

597
00:45:21,970 --> 00:45:24,269
What did I do so wrong?

598
00:45:26,470 --> 00:45:28,779
Why are you doing this to me?

599
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:34,779
Why are you doing this to me?

600
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:36,495
Young Woong!

601
00:45:36,519 --> 00:45:38,326
Se Rin, please!

602
00:45:38,350 --> 00:45:41,120
Why are you doing this to me?

603
00:45:44,419 --> 00:45:45,590
Young Woong!

604
00:45:45,889 --> 00:45:48,289
Young Woong!

605
00:45:50,629 --> 00:45:53,700
Why are you doing this to me?

606
00:46:00,309 --> 00:46:01,316
What do you want?

607
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:03,710
Why are you crying
and making a fuss in public?

608
00:46:04,679 --> 00:46:05,950
Why do you care?

609
00:46:06,149 --> 00:46:07,750
Was he harassing you?

610
00:46:09,620 --> 00:46:11,679
- What?
- If he wasn't, then never mind.

611
00:46:13,519 --> 00:46:14,620
You see,

612
00:46:15,090 --> 00:46:17,990
I can't stand scumbags
who harass women.

613
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:25,200
Can you help me?

614
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:31,046
Actually...

615
00:46:31,070 --> 00:46:34,169
She said he was stalking her.

616
00:46:37,039 --> 00:46:39,110
He wanted me to frighten him a bit.

617
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:43,395
I called both of them just now.

618
00:46:43,419 --> 00:46:45,789
- Se Rin.
- I'm so scared.

619
00:46:45,850 --> 00:46:47,850
Se Rin, are you there?

620
00:46:53,129 --> 00:46:54,429
It's that house.

621
00:47:04,370 --> 00:47:06,110
Did that scumbag do this?

622
00:47:23,490 --> 00:47:25,490
You just need to scare him...

623
00:47:26,759 --> 00:47:28,930
so that he won't come back.

624
00:47:29,759 --> 00:47:32,446
This is exactly why
the police exist...

625
00:47:32,470 --> 00:47:35,640
and we pay tax. You should've asked
Ji Hyeong Ju for help.

626
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,616
I thought you two were close.

627
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:40,560
(Young Woong, please come
to my house right now.)

628
00:47:49,750 --> 00:47:50,880
What are you doing?

629
00:47:53,089 --> 00:47:54,690
What are you doing? Hey, hey.

630
00:47:56,390 --> 00:47:58,460
What are you... Stay still!

631
00:47:58,930 --> 00:47:59,990
Hey!

632
00:48:01,259 --> 00:48:03,160
What's wrong with you?
What are you doing?

633
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:06,470
What are you doing?

634
00:48:12,539 --> 00:48:13,670
What are you doing?

635
00:48:14,269 --> 00:48:15,339
Se Rin!

636
00:48:15,609 --> 00:48:17,839
- Young Woong!
- Who are you?

637
00:48:20,380 --> 00:48:21,880
Young Woong!

638
00:48:25,049 --> 00:48:27,390
Who are you?
What are you trying to pull?

639
00:48:36,759 --> 00:48:37,960
You did well.

640
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:40,170
You should run...

641
00:48:40,869 --> 00:48:43,470
because no one's going
to believe you.

642
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:49,980
- Do you really want to die?
- Mr. Bae Jung Tae!

643
00:48:57,049 --> 00:49:00,089
Then what about that
written statement?

644
00:49:00,890 --> 00:49:01,950
What about it?

645
00:49:02,150 --> 00:49:05,119
I just wrote down
what my lawyer told me.

646
00:49:05,259 --> 00:49:08,390
He talked about my past crimes,
the circumstances, and the witness.

647
00:49:08,430 --> 00:49:11,200
He said claiming innocence
would only worsen my sentence...

648
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:12,805
and that it'd be better
to just admit to it...

649
00:49:12,829 --> 00:49:14,799
and aim for a lesser sentence.

650
00:49:14,829 --> 00:49:17,640
Everything he said was correct.

651
00:49:18,099 --> 00:49:19,670
That's why I wrote it.

652
00:49:23,539 --> 00:49:26,849
If you want, you can sue her
for committing calumny.

653
00:49:27,509 --> 00:49:29,079
You can request
for a retrial as well.

654
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:30,420
That's fine.

655
00:49:32,420 --> 00:49:34,795
At first, I was determined...

656
00:49:34,819 --> 00:49:38,119
to end her the moment I got out.

657
00:49:38,589 --> 00:49:41,130
But now, I'm too lazy
to do anything.

658
00:49:44,759 --> 00:49:48,599
Do you know why Ms. Lee Shin
helped you receive parole?

659
00:49:53,609 --> 00:49:56,240
I guess she's paying me back...

660
00:49:56,910 --> 00:49:58,539
for keeping an eye on Kim Se Rin.

661
00:49:59,009 --> 00:50:00,785
Was there anything else
she asked you to do?

662
00:50:00,809 --> 00:50:04,325
She didn't. I don't care
about that woman or Zian Clinic.

663
00:50:04,349 --> 00:50:06,549
I won't even think
about going there.

664
00:50:08,490 --> 00:50:11,619
I'm going to move back
to the countryside and farm.

665
00:50:12,890 --> 00:50:15,059
And I'll die
when it's my time to die.

666
00:50:40,650 --> 00:50:42,390
Young Woong, reported me?

667
00:50:42,490 --> 00:50:45,166
No way. There's no way he did that!

668
00:50:45,190 --> 00:50:47,359
Ms. Kim Se Rin, calm down.

669
00:50:47,630 --> 00:50:48,930
Put the knife down.

670
00:50:51,730 --> 00:50:53,706
Call Young Woong now!

671
00:50:53,730 --> 00:50:54,730
Kim Se Rin!

672
00:50:55,369 --> 00:50:56,839
Why are you here?

673
00:50:57,670 --> 00:50:59,416
Call Young Woong now!

674
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:02,369
That guy isn't even your boyfriend.

675
00:51:02,710 --> 00:51:05,156
You're just chasing him
like a madwoman!

676
00:51:05,180 --> 00:51:06,755
No!

677
00:51:06,779 --> 00:51:08,525
He even patted my head...

678
00:51:08,549 --> 00:51:09,926
and waited for my bus.

679
00:51:09,950 --> 00:51:11,156
We even had meals together.

680
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:12,380
Please!

681
00:51:13,849 --> 00:51:15,490
You always cause trouble.

682
00:51:15,650 --> 00:51:17,789
And why do we have to
clean up your mess?

683
00:51:18,420 --> 00:51:20,559
I'm so sick of this!

684
00:51:23,099 --> 00:51:24,829
Don't threaten us with your life.

685
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:27,470
You should really kill yourself.

686
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:33,470
What?

687
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:40,325
Let go of me!
Bring Young Woong here!

688
00:51:40,349 --> 00:51:41,980
Call him now!

689
00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:44,196
- Bring him here.
- Move.

690
00:51:44,220 --> 00:51:46,265
Bring him here now!

691
00:51:46,289 --> 00:51:47,990
Young Woong!

692
00:51:48,319 --> 00:51:49,359
Se Rin.

693
00:51:52,059 --> 00:51:53,089
Se Rin.

694
00:51:57,599 --> 00:51:59,369
Young Woong reported me.

695
00:51:59,930 --> 00:52:01,799
I went back in time
just to be with him.

696
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,545
It's just like before the reset.

697
00:52:03,569 --> 00:52:05,869
No, it's more awful.

698
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:08,569
I was really happy with him.

699
00:52:10,279 --> 00:52:13,085
I keep thinking about
my previous life. I can't stand it.

700
00:52:13,109 --> 00:52:14,856
I gave you a way out
from all of this.

701
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:16,319
Why are you still here?

702
00:52:16,549 --> 00:52:18,680
Is he more important than your life?

703
00:52:19,990 --> 00:52:21,190
If you die,

704
00:52:22,019 --> 00:52:24,059
your love will be useless.

705
00:52:24,319 --> 00:52:25,990
Without Young Woong,

706
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:28,730
my life is pointless.

707
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:31,976
Ms. Lee, let me do the reset
one more time.

708
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,730
Then, I'm sure
I can do a better job.

709
00:52:33,930 --> 00:52:36,400
Please give me one more chance.
I'm begging you.

710
00:52:41,269 --> 00:52:42,269
Fine.

711
00:52:43,839 --> 00:52:44,910
Really?

712
00:52:46,849 --> 00:52:47,950
To do that,

713
00:52:48,450 --> 00:52:51,420
you must survive first, right?

714
00:53:05,059 --> 00:53:08,146
At first, I was determined...

715
00:53:08,170 --> 00:53:10,440
to end her the moment I got out.

716
00:53:10,740 --> 00:53:13,216
But now, I'm too lazy
to do anything.

717
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:16,140
I'm going to move back
to the countryside and farm.

718
00:53:16,210 --> 00:53:18,480
And I'll die
when it's my time to die.

(Happy Correction, Happy Citizen)

721
00:53:58,119 --> 00:54:00,250
Did you sort everything
out with Se Rin?

722
00:54:02,190 --> 00:54:03,595
I guess it wasn't a happy ending...

723
00:54:03,619 --> 00:54:05,699
where you understood each other
and made up with her.

724
00:54:06,490 --> 00:54:08,190
Even you couldn't...

725
00:54:09,430 --> 00:54:11,059
forgive her that easily, right?

726
00:54:12,799 --> 00:54:14,400
Does your daughter...

727
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,140
know that
she's going through the reset?

728
00:54:21,740 --> 00:54:24,680
If she finds out
that she's repeating...

729
00:54:26,279 --> 00:54:29,250
the same year over and over again
because of your cruel hobby,

730
00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:34,190
what will your daughter think?

731
00:54:37,819 --> 00:54:39,630
"Cruel hobby".

732
00:54:44,900 --> 00:54:46,529
I'll try to match your description.

733
00:54:50,799 --> 00:54:53,069
I'll tell you...

734
00:54:54,470 --> 00:54:55,447
who's really next.

735
00:54:55,471 --> 00:54:56,509
No.

736
00:54:57,339 --> 00:54:59,650
I won't let you have power
over me anymore.

737
00:55:02,279 --> 00:55:04,650
Ga Hyeon,
you could save this person.

738
00:55:06,849 --> 00:55:08,789
Are you sure you won't regret it?

739
00:55:30,140 --> 00:55:31,279

Her heart transplant surgery
went well.

746
00:56:47,089 --> 00:56:50,190
It was hard to find a donor
who was a match to your sister.

747
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:53,160
But Ms. Lee made sure
she had a donor.

Who is she?

751
00:58:02,430 --> 00:58:06,529
My gosh.
You don't believe me, do you?

752
00:58:08,599 --> 00:58:11,900
Were you scared that I might get
back at Kim Se Rin?

753
00:58:12,869 --> 00:58:14,269
You're going home, right?

754
00:58:16,210 --> 00:58:18,856
You'll be relieved
once you drop me off at my home.

755
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:20,450
Then, give me a ride.

756
00:58:31,319 --> 00:58:33,890
- Your younger sister...
- My gosh.

Let's not talk
about our personal lives.

Coming home was pretty easy
thanks to you.
