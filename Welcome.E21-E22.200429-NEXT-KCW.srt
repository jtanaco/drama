<b>(Episode 21)</b>

2
00:00:15,456 --> 00:00:17,056
<b>He looks fine.</b>

3
00:00:17,056 --> 00:00:18,687
<b>That can't be.</b>

4
00:00:19,087 --> 00:00:20,787
<b>Can you take a closer look?</b>

5
00:00:20,886 --> 00:00:21,896
<b>Did he show any particular symptoms?</b>

6
00:00:21,896 --> 00:00:25,497
<b>Like vomiting, diarrhea,
or loss of appetite.</b>

7
00:00:26,966 --> 00:00:29,067
<b>Then why are you here?</b>

8
00:00:30,267 --> 00:00:31,767
<b>He won't change.</b>

9
00:00:35,907 --> 00:00:37,877
<b>(Cats have nine lives.
Three lives to have fun,)</b>

10
00:00:37,877 --> 00:00:40,377
<b>(3 lives to wander around,
and 3 lives to stay)</b>

11
00:00:48,756 --> 00:00:51,857
<b>Get some rest.
I'll get you some warm milk.</b>

12
00:01:11,776 --> 00:01:12,806
<b>Hey.</b>

13
00:01:13,806 --> 00:01:15,517
<b>You startled me.</b>

14
00:01:15,916 --> 00:01:17,877
<b>What happened?
Why didn't you change?</b>

15
00:01:17,877 --> 00:01:19,446
<b>I was sleepy.</b>

16
00:01:20,487 --> 00:01:21,586
<b>What?</b>

17
00:01:22,386 --> 00:01:24,056
<b>Gosh, I was worried.</b>

18
00:01:26,957 --> 00:01:28,526
<b>Are you okay now?</b>

19
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:30,856
<b>I slept well last night,
so I'm okay.</b>

20
00:01:31,356 --> 00:01:33,967
<b>Are you really okay? Let me see.</b>

21
00:01:34,226 --> 00:01:35,237
<b>Are you sure you're not sick?</b>

22
00:01:35,237 --> 00:01:36,437
<b>I'm really okay.</b>

23
00:01:39,767 --> 00:01:41,937
<b>Let's go outside.
The weather is nice.</b>

24
00:01:42,177 --> 00:01:43,177
<b>No.</b>

25
00:01:43,636 --> 00:01:45,077
<b>Let's just rest today.</b>

26
00:01:45,077 --> 00:01:47,506
<b>You said time is precious.
Do you want me to just sleep?</b>

27
00:01:47,877 --> 00:01:49,746
<b>I thought you were going to make
every second count.</b>

28
00:01:52,246 --> 00:01:53,347
<b>Where should we go?</b>

29
00:01:58,256 --> 00:01:59,427
<b>There's...</b>

30
00:02:00,756 --> 00:02:03,526
<b>actually a place I want to go
with you.</b>

31
00:02:05,267 --> 00:02:06,866
<b>Don't look yet.</b>

32
00:02:06,866 --> 00:02:08,567
<b>Why not? What is it?</b>

33
00:02:08,567 --> 00:02:09,567
<b>Here.</b>

34
00:02:09,967 --> 00:02:14,706
<b>Okay, ready? 1, 2,</b>

35
00:02:15,476 --> 00:02:16,476
<b>three.</b>

36
00:02:26,087 --> 00:02:27,416
<b>Where are we?</b>

37
00:02:28,557 --> 00:02:29,587
<b>The sea.</b>

38
00:02:29,756 --> 00:02:31,317
<b>But it doesn't look like a peach.</b>

39
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:32,527
<b>It's warm, isn't it?</b>

40
00:02:37,826 --> 00:02:39,367
<b>Hey, is that human a fish?</b>

41
00:02:39,467 --> 00:02:40,826
<b>Is he like me?</b>

42
00:02:40,826 --> 00:02:42,937
<b>No, he's wearing an oxygen tank.</b>

43
00:02:44,967 --> 00:02:47,506
<b>That's how he's able
to swim underwater?</b>

44
00:02:47,706 --> 00:02:49,576
<b>To me, my oxygen tank is...</b>

45
00:02:50,877 --> 00:02:51,877
<b>Me?</b>

46
00:02:52,546 --> 00:02:53,576
<b>- Coffee?
- Hey.</b>

47
00:03:07,587 --> 00:03:08,627
<b>Do you like it?</b>

48
00:03:09,627 --> 00:03:10,657
<b>Yes.</b>

49
00:03:11,856 --> 00:03:14,467
<b>But we came here because of me.
What about you?</b>

50
00:03:14,826 --> 00:03:17,337
<b>I'm with you.
That's all that matters.</b>

51
00:03:17,537 --> 00:03:20,006
<b>But still, don't you
want to go anywhere?</b>

52
00:03:25,546 --> 00:03:27,506
<b>There actually is a place.</b>

53
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:31,446
<b>This is...</b>

54
00:03:31,446 --> 00:03:33,117
<b>- Let's go inside.
- What?</b>

55
00:03:35,557 --> 00:03:37,087
<b>Gosh, they're so pretty.</b>

56
00:03:37,087 --> 00:03:38,856
<b>What do you think about this one?</b>

57
00:03:38,956 --> 00:03:39,986
<b>It's okay.</b>

58
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:41,997
<b>I know, right?
It's not too bad. Here.</b>

59
00:03:42,356 --> 00:03:43,426
<b>Okay.</b>

60
00:03:44,527 --> 00:03:46,226
<b>It suits you well.</b>

61
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,067
<b>I don't own anything.</b>

62
00:03:48,067 --> 00:03:49,867
<b>That's why I want to get it for you
as a gift.</b>

63
00:03:50,266 --> 00:03:53,506
<b>Nothing is yours. You always
borrow things from others.</b>

64
00:03:54,106 --> 00:03:55,266
<b>This is yours now.</b>

65
00:03:55,976 --> 00:03:59,176
<b>And this one is mine.</b>

66
00:04:00,076 --> 00:04:01,147
<b>Let's get one as a couple.</b>

67
00:04:48,356 --> 00:04:49,556
<b>It's fun.</b>

68
00:04:50,597 --> 00:04:52,066
<b>- No.
- What?</b>

69
00:04:52,066 --> 00:04:53,327
<b>Eat this.</b>

70
00:04:56,597 --> 00:04:58,666
<b>Hey, scoot over.</b>

71
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:01,537
<b>- Why?
- Come on. Scoot over.</b>

72
00:05:01,537 --> 00:05:02,837
<b>No.</b>

73
00:05:08,876 --> 00:05:09,947
<b>Hey!</b>

74
00:05:25,126 --> 00:05:27,767
<b>What? What do you mean?</b>

75
00:05:27,897 --> 00:05:29,137
<b>Me too.</b>

76
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:32,666
<b>It's not too bad, right?</b>

77
00:05:48,347 --> 00:05:50,056
<b>This isn't alcohol.
It tastes like cream.</b>

78
00:05:50,056 --> 00:05:51,457
<b>- Do you want another glass?
- Yes.</b>

79
00:05:52,356 --> 00:05:54,356
<b>Wait. Let's drink
once the others get here.</b>

80
00:05:54,356 --> 00:05:55,996
<b>What? Who's coming?</b>

81
00:05:59,467 --> 00:06:01,027
<b>I invited them. Hey, guys.</b>

82
00:06:03,066 --> 00:06:04,337
<b>Mom. Dad.</b>

83
00:06:04,637 --> 00:06:05,767
<b>Yes?</b>

84
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:07,537
<b>- Hello.
- Hey, Jae Seon.</b>

85
00:06:07,707 --> 00:06:09,476
<b>My goodness, Bang Guk Bong.</b>

86
00:06:09,476 --> 00:06:11,876
<b>Hey, you traitor.</b>

87
00:06:11,876 --> 00:06:14,147
<b>I heard you quit working here
and got a job at Jae Seon's cafe.</b>

88
00:06:14,176 --> 00:06:15,717
<b>He blackmailed me,
so I didn't have a choice.</b>

89
00:06:15,717 --> 00:06:17,546
<b>- What are you saying?
- Okay, everyone.</b>

90
00:06:17,546 --> 00:06:20,246
<b>If you're done saying hi,
let's all sit down.</b>

91
00:06:20,347 --> 00:06:21,847
<b>I have an important
announcement to make.</b>

92
00:06:25,017 --> 00:06:27,726
<b>Gosh, this isn't enough food.</b>

93
00:06:27,726 --> 00:06:29,626
<b>- What are you talking about?
- Today, I'm sitting with...</b>

94
00:06:31,056 --> 00:06:33,327
<b>the woman I like.</b>

95
00:06:33,697 --> 00:06:35,166
<b>- What?
- What did you say?</b>

96
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:36,767
<b>Are you serious?</b>

97
00:06:36,767 --> 00:06:37,796
<b>Yes.</b>

98
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:40,207
<b>And she is...</b>

99
00:06:41,436 --> 00:06:42,537
<b>Sol Ah, is it you?</b>

100
00:06:43,376 --> 00:06:44,376
<b>What?</b>

101
00:06:45,176 --> 00:06:46,447
<b>It must be Sol Ah.</b>

102
00:06:48,407 --> 00:06:49,876
<b>- No...
- Listen.</b>

103
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:53,387
<b>Did you guys think this through?</b>

104
00:06:54,186 --> 00:06:56,287
<b>You need to be careful...</b>

105
00:06:56,287 --> 00:06:59,657
<b>before you start a relationship
if you don't want to mess it up.</b>

106
00:06:59,657 --> 00:07:02,027
<b>- What are you talking about?
- Let me talk.</b>

107
00:07:02,056 --> 00:07:03,827
<b>Can you guys believe this?</b>

108
00:07:03,996 --> 00:07:05,796
<b>Can you? I mean, come on.</b>

109
00:07:06,226 --> 00:07:08,066
<b>We're talking about
Ko Doo Sik and Kim Sol Ah.</b>

110
00:07:08,066 --> 00:07:09,936
<b>- Seriously.
- I know.</b>

111
00:07:09,936 --> 00:07:12,637
<b>You guys make such a great couple.</b>

112
00:07:13,066 --> 00:07:16,077
<b>- Right?
- My goodness, you're unbelievable.</b>

113
00:07:16,707 --> 00:07:18,676
<b>Dad, that's not what I meant to say.</b>

114
00:07:18,676 --> 00:07:22,106
<b>You didn't need to make
such a big fuss about this.</b>

115
00:07:22,106 --> 00:07:24,876
<b>Sol Ah, thank you.</b>

116
00:07:24,876 --> 00:07:26,447
<b>Thank you.</b>

117
00:07:26,647 --> 00:07:28,186
<b>No, you got it all wrong.</b>

118
00:07:28,186 --> 00:07:29,287
<b>Mom, listen to me.</b>

119
00:07:29,287 --> 00:07:32,356
<b>You've known each other for ages,
but cheers to a new start.</b>

120
00:07:32,356 --> 00:07:33,356
<b>- Here.
- Cheers.</b>

121
00:07:33,356 --> 00:07:34,986
<b>It's Eun Ji Eun.</b>

122
00:07:37,796 --> 00:07:38,796
<b>What?</b>

123
00:07:38,796 --> 00:07:40,226
<b>Ji Eun is the woman...</b>

124
00:07:41,097 --> 00:07:42,236
<b>I have feelings for.</b>

125
00:07:44,097 --> 00:07:47,837
<b>Oh, it's not... It's not Sol Ah?</b>

126
00:07:48,207 --> 00:07:50,236
<b>No, I'm seeing someone else.</b>

127
00:07:50,907 --> 00:07:52,546
<b>You have a boyfriend?</b>

128
00:07:52,546 --> 00:07:54,676
<b>Who? Who is that punk?</b>

129
00:07:54,676 --> 00:07:56,777
<b>Why are you guys focused on her?</b>

130
00:07:57,176 --> 00:07:58,676
<b>You should be focused on Ji Eun.</b>

131
00:07:59,246 --> 00:08:00,447
<b>Don't you want to know
more about her?</b>

132
00:08:00,486 --> 00:08:02,186
<b>She has so many good traits.</b>

133
00:08:02,287 --> 00:08:04,017
<b>She shoots guns really well,</b>

134
00:08:04,157 --> 00:08:05,587
<b>and she makes the best
soju and beer cocktail.</b>

135
00:08:06,457 --> 00:08:08,827
<b>She shoots well and makes the best
soju and beer cocktail?</b>

136
00:08:09,056 --> 00:08:11,726
<b>And she's very sincere
with her work.</b>

137
00:08:12,226 --> 00:08:13,866
<b>She cares about all her drawings...</b>

138
00:08:14,066 --> 00:08:17,137
<b>even if they're on a leaflet.</b>

139
00:08:17,467 --> 00:08:18,537
<b>And...</b>

140
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:20,207
<b>she's pretty.</b>

141
00:08:21,337 --> 00:08:22,736
<b>She's pretty.</b>

142
00:08:24,637 --> 00:08:26,077
<b>Yes, she's pretty.</b>

143
00:08:26,077 --> 00:08:28,077
<b>- She really is.
- Yes, I agree with that one.</b>

144
00:08:38,556 --> 00:08:39,857
<b>Hello?</b>

145
00:08:42,727 --> 00:08:44,796
<b>Yes, I'm Kim Sol Ah.</b>

146
00:08:45,997 --> 00:08:47,227
<b>It's not easy, is it?</b>

147
00:08:48,267 --> 00:08:49,296
<b>What's not easy?</b>

148
00:08:49,336 --> 00:08:50,336
<b>Pardon?</b>

149
00:08:50,466 --> 00:08:52,836
<b>To stay beside her
like a normal person.</b>

150
00:08:57,706 --> 00:09:00,007
<b>There are things that humans do.</b>

151
00:09:00,247 --> 00:09:02,247
<b>We introduce the people we date
to our friends and family,</b>

152
00:09:02,247 --> 00:09:03,877
<b>seek their acknowledgement,</b>

153
00:09:05,176 --> 00:09:08,086
<b>and also get married.</b>

154
00:09:08,887 --> 00:09:11,586
<b>It's a very natural process
for humans.</b>

155
00:09:14,086 --> 00:09:15,757
<b>But Sol Ah won't
be able to do that.</b>

156
00:09:17,426 --> 00:09:18,796
<b>Because of me.</b>

157
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:20,926
<b>I'm not saying this to hurt you.</b>

158
00:09:22,367 --> 00:09:24,137
<b>It's not like
you didn't know any of this.</b>

159
00:09:28,737 --> 00:09:30,037
<b>What should I do?</b>

160
00:09:31,676 --> 00:09:32,806
<b>What's going on?</b>

161
00:09:33,546 --> 00:09:35,716
<b>I have no idea.</b>

162
00:09:36,977 --> 00:09:39,216
<b>She saw my webtoon.</b>

163
00:09:39,887 --> 00:09:40,887
<b>Who?</b>

164
00:09:41,387 --> 00:09:43,357
<b>The person who manages
the portal webtoon page.</b>

165
00:09:44,157 --> 00:09:46,686
<b>She asked if I'd like to add some
stuff to my story and drawings...</b>

166
00:09:47,326 --> 00:09:50,397
<b>and that they might publish
my webtoon online officially.</b>

167
00:09:51,397 --> 00:09:52,527
<b>That's great.</b>

168
00:09:54,997 --> 00:09:56,267
<b>I can't believe this.</b>

169
00:09:56,497 --> 00:09:58,696
<b>Do you think I'll do well?
What if I don't do a good job?</b>

170
00:09:58,696 --> 00:10:00,607
<b>You'll do great.
I know you'll do a good job.</b>

171
00:10:00,607 --> 00:10:03,676
<b>This is all thanks to you.
You made this happen.</b>

172
00:10:04,076 --> 00:10:06,306
<b>You're the one who drew them.
I'm so proud of you.</b>

173
00:10:37,076 --> 00:10:38,137
<b>Thanks.</b>

174
00:10:54,326 --> 00:10:56,056
<b>Hong Jo, I'll see you later.</b>

175
00:11:00,127 --> 00:11:01,296
<b>Sol Ah, take your coffee.</b>

176
00:11:04,466 --> 00:11:05,537
<b>She left.</b>

177
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:08,737
<b>- My coffee!
- Here.</b>

178
00:11:09,237 --> 00:11:10,436
<b>Thanks. I'll see you.</b>

179
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:11,477
<b>- Bye.
- Bye.</b>

180
00:11:15,846 --> 00:11:17,076
<b>My bag!</b>

181
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:18,647
<b>- Your bag? Where is it?
- My bag.</b>

182
00:11:18,647 --> 00:11:20,747
<b>- Over there. Hurry.
- Okay, your bag.</b>

183
00:11:20,946 --> 00:11:22,416
<b>Here.</b>

184
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:24,517
<b>- Did you forget anything else?
- No, I'm all set.</b>

185
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,127
<b>- I'll see you. Bye.
- See you.</b>

186
00:11:33,066 --> 00:11:35,326
<b>- My lips!
- Chapstick?</b>

187
00:11:35,326 --> 00:11:36,867
<b>- My lips.
- Didn't you apply it?</b>

188
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:41,537
<b>Why aren't you
wearing the bag I got you?</b>

189
00:11:41,936 --> 00:11:43,206
<b>We got it as a couple.</b>

190
00:11:44,706 --> 00:11:46,977
<b>- I'll wear the bag.
- I'll be off now.</b>

191
00:11:56,686 --> 00:11:58,186
<b>That bag looks new.</b>

192
00:11:59,157 --> 00:12:00,357
<b>I got matching bags.</b>

193
00:12:01,227 --> 00:12:03,956
<b>Don't you need a girlfriend
to get matching bags?</b>

194
00:12:04,696 --> 00:12:06,397
<b>Where is your girlfriend?</b>

195
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:08,926
<b>She took her bag and went to work.</b>

196
00:12:09,296 --> 00:12:11,497
<b>What about you?
Don't you have anywhere to go?</b>

197
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:13,666
<b>No.</b>

198
00:12:18,836 --> 00:12:20,407
<b>The bag is empty.</b>

199
00:12:21,747 --> 00:12:22,977
<b>I don't own anything.</b>

200
00:12:23,316 --> 00:12:25,546
<b>My grandma also got me a bag...</b>

201
00:12:25,946 --> 00:12:27,716
<b>because I'll be
going to school soon.</b>

202
00:12:28,086 --> 00:12:29,987
<b>But it's really heavy.</b>

203
00:12:30,257 --> 00:12:32,556
<b>I carry around a notice book,
journal, and pencil case.</b>

204
00:12:32,727 --> 00:12:36,357
<b>And inside my pencil case,
there's an eraser...</b>

205
00:12:36,657 --> 00:12:38,326
<b>and three pencils.</b>

206
00:12:40,696 --> 00:12:41,796
<b>I envy you.</b>

207
00:12:42,326 --> 00:12:43,936
<b>You have a lot of stuff in your bag.</b>

208
00:12:44,137 --> 00:12:45,936
<b>And you have
somewhere to go every day.</b>

209
00:12:46,306 --> 00:12:47,867
<b>I envy you.</b>

210
00:12:48,107 --> 00:12:50,007
<b>You have nothing in your bag.</b>

211
00:12:50,007 --> 00:12:51,977
<b>And you get to go wherever you want.</b>

212
00:12:52,277 --> 00:12:53,806
<b>I want to stay.</b>

213
00:12:54,247 --> 00:12:56,076
<b>I want to be so heavy
so I won't be able to go anywhere.</b>

214
00:12:56,216 --> 00:12:59,186
<b>Dae Sung, can you
run an errand for me?</b>

215
00:12:59,517 --> 00:13:00,747
<b>Okay, Grandma.</b>

216
00:13:10,627 --> 00:13:14,166
<b>Yes, I'm going to stay by her side.</b>

217
00:13:16,397 --> 00:13:17,596
<b>I told her everything.</b>

218
00:13:18,796 --> 00:13:20,306
<b>But she still accepted me.</b>

219
00:13:29,247 --> 00:13:30,316
<b>What?</b>

220
00:13:32,117 --> 00:13:33,287
<b>What do you mean?</b>

221
00:13:38,956 --> 00:13:40,027
<b>Are you serious?</b>

222
00:14:33,647 --> 00:14:35,907
<b>- Hey, it's a cat.
- Can you hold this for me?</b>

223
00:14:41,517 --> 00:14:44,086
<b>Hello? Yes, I'll be right there.</b>

224
00:14:44,316 --> 00:14:45,316
<b>Okay, bye.</b>

225
00:14:47,586 --> 00:14:50,257
<b>- Where is the cat?
- Over there sitting on the bench.</b>

226
00:14:52,997 --> 00:14:54,027
<b>That's weird.</b>

227
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:56,166
<b>I'm sure it was a cat.</b>

228
00:15:02,107 --> 00:15:03,336
<b>She was right.</b>

229
00:15:05,277 --> 00:15:07,107
<b>He's really a cat.</b>

230
00:15:09,277 --> 00:15:11,446
<b>I'd say he's as cute as a cat.</b>

231
00:15:16,887 --> 00:15:18,916
<b>The cute guy is walking toward us.</b>

232
00:15:23,326 --> 00:15:24,426
<b>Can I have one?</b>

233
00:15:26,066 --> 00:15:27,066
<b>What?</b>

234
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:35,066
<b>Can I have a cup of coffee?</b>

235
00:15:40,076 --> 00:15:42,777
<b>Here. We got more than enough.</b>

236
00:15:45,716 --> 00:15:46,747
<b>Thank you.</b>

237
00:15:49,046 --> 00:15:50,787
<b>Would you like this as well?</b>

238
00:15:56,757 --> 00:15:57,796
<b>Hey.</b>

239
00:16:02,227 --> 00:16:03,336
<b>Hey.</b>

240
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:05,767
<b>What? Do you have something to say?</b>

241
00:16:07,966 --> 00:16:09,137
<b>What is it? What is it about?</b>

242
00:16:10,676 --> 00:16:11,977
<b>No, not you.</b>

243
00:16:12,877 --> 00:16:13,977
<b>Then is it for me?</b>

244
00:16:14,706 --> 00:16:15,747
<b>What?</b>

245
00:16:16,946 --> 00:16:17,946
<b>Well...</b>

246
00:16:19,176 --> 00:16:20,186
<b>Oh, right.</b>

247
00:16:21,287 --> 00:16:24,056
<b>Can you take this to Ms. Park
and ask her if it's okay?</b>

248
00:16:24,586 --> 00:16:25,686
<b>- This?
- Yes.</b>

249
00:16:31,696 --> 00:16:33,926
<b>- I saw it happening.
- What did you see?</b>

250
00:16:34,566 --> 00:16:37,696
<b>I saw him turn into a cat.</b>

251
00:16:42,237 --> 00:16:43,306
<b>When?</b>

252
00:16:44,877 --> 00:16:45,907
<b>Wait.</b>

253
00:16:46,107 --> 00:16:49,046
<b>- He's still outside.
- The guy who asked us for coffee?</b>

254
00:16:50,576 --> 00:16:51,816
<b>The guy who asked you for coffee?</b>

255
00:16:51,816 --> 00:16:54,446
<b>Some guy used his handsome face...</b>

256
00:16:54,446 --> 00:16:56,117
<b>to ask us for coffee.</b>

257
00:16:56,387 --> 00:16:58,787
<b>His eyes were sparkling...</b>

258
00:16:58,956 --> 00:17:00,387
<b>as he asked us for a cup of coffee.</b>

259
00:17:00,857 --> 00:17:02,086
<b>Are you sure he wasn't a weirdo?</b>

260
00:17:02,826 --> 00:17:04,556
<b>Did you give him one?</b>

261
00:17:04,657 --> 00:17:07,466
<b>You should've seen his eyes.
I couldn't ignore him.</b>

262
00:17:07,596 --> 00:17:09,737
<b>Why is he still there?</b>

263
00:17:10,636 --> 00:17:12,636
<b>- I wonder if he's a beggar.
- Sol Ah.</b>

264
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,017
<b>Do you know him?</b>

265
00:17:25,846 --> 00:17:28,646
<b>- Yes.
- Really? Who is it?</b>

266
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:31,656
<b>Well...</b>

267
00:17:32,257 --> 00:17:34,027
<b>I'll be right back.</b>

268
00:17:37,326 --> 00:17:38,326
<b>Hong Jo.</b>

269
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:40,767
<b>Sol Ah.</b>

270
00:17:41,396 --> 00:17:42,997
<b>What are you doing here?</b>

271
00:17:43,467 --> 00:17:44,596
<b>I came to see you.</b>

272
00:17:45,296 --> 00:17:47,836
<b>- You should've waited at home.
- I wanted to see you faster...</b>

273
00:17:48,737 --> 00:17:50,507
<b>so we could be together for longer.</b>

274
00:17:51,576 --> 00:17:52,677
<b>You're unbelievable.</b>

275
00:17:54,546 --> 00:17:56,217
<b>Sol Ah, you see...</b>

276
00:17:56,217 --> 00:17:58,346
<b>I can't believe
you asked a stranger for coffee.</b>

277
00:17:58,717 --> 00:17:59,987
<b>They were my seniors at work.</b>

278
00:18:00,346 --> 00:18:01,386
<b>Sorry.</b>

279
00:18:02,346 --> 00:18:05,586
<b>Wait for me at home.
I still have a lot of work left.</b>

280
00:18:06,826 --> 00:18:10,356
<b>Okay, I know humans have jobs.</b>

281
00:18:12,296 --> 00:18:13,497
<b>Okay, don't worry.</b>

282
00:18:14,027 --> 00:18:15,296
<b>I also have something to do.</b>

283
00:18:32,177 --> 00:18:33,287
<b>What are you doing here?</b>

284
00:18:34,816 --> 00:18:36,917
<b>Today's my day off.
I need to work on something.</b>

285
00:18:37,457 --> 00:18:38,586
<b>I need to ask you for a favor.</b>

286
00:18:39,356 --> 00:18:40,626
<b>Will you give me some space?</b>

287
00:18:42,386 --> 00:18:43,556
<b>Teach me how.</b>

288
00:18:44,197 --> 00:18:45,257
<b>Hey.</b>

289
00:18:48,267 --> 00:18:49,497
<b>Wait.</b>

290
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:52,437
<b>I told you not to hold it like this.</b>

291
00:18:53,967 --> 00:18:55,066
<b>Give me that.</b>

292
00:18:55,906 --> 00:18:58,406
<b>You need to hold it with
these two fingers and keep it fixed.</b>

293
00:19:03,277 --> 00:19:06,447
<b>"Puss in Boots"
taught the wrong thing to cats.</b>

294
00:19:07,217 --> 00:19:08,217
<b>Hey.</b>

295
00:19:08,846 --> 00:19:10,987
<b>Do you think you can get
anything you want...</b>

296
00:19:10,987 --> 00:19:12,586
<b>if you just look at me
with those sparkly eyes?</b>

297
00:19:21,866 --> 00:19:23,437
<b>Why do you want to learn this
all of a sudden?</b>

298
00:19:24,796 --> 00:19:26,406
<b>Teach me how to engrave
Sol Ah's name on wood.</b>

299
00:19:32,477 --> 00:19:33,806
<b>Do you want to spend time
with Sol Ah and the guys again?</b>

300
00:19:42,987 --> 00:19:45,616
<b>(Not really.)</b>

301
00:19:50,096 --> 00:19:51,156
<b>Not really.</b>

302
00:19:54,197 --> 00:19:56,126
<b>(It was fun.)</b>

303
00:20:03,336 --> 00:20:06,306
<b>It was fun. Let's invite
the others to dinner.</b>

304
00:20:18,687 --> 00:20:20,086
<b>You're so tactless.</b>

305
00:20:26,427 --> 00:20:27,997
<b>(You said...)</b>

306
00:20:31,537 --> 00:20:32,566
<b>Darn it.</b>

307
00:20:34,007 --> 00:20:36,806
<b>You said you liked me
because I'm tactless.</b>

308
00:20:37,406 --> 00:20:39,207
<b>Yes, that's how it is.</b>

309
00:20:39,306 --> 00:20:42,306
<b>The reason you fell in love
becomes the reason you break up.</b>

310
00:20:42,447 --> 00:20:43,747
<b>But already?</b>

311
00:20:44,717 --> 00:20:45,876
<b>Doo Sik.</b>

312
00:20:46,316 --> 00:20:48,447
<b>You're talking about love

313
00:20:51,287 --> 00:20:53,326
<b>You really are so tactless.</b>

314
00:20:56,596 --> 00:20:57,596
<b>Ji Eun.</b>

315
00:20:57,596 --> 00:20:59,667
<b>Will you think about others too?</b>

316
00:20:59,697 --> 00:21:00,826
<b>What did I do?</b>

317
00:21:01,227 --> 00:21:02,896
<b>- Forget it.
- What?</b>

318
00:21:02,967 --> 00:21:04,667
<b>That I told my parents about you?</b>

319
00:21:04,737 --> 00:21:06,096
<b>Should I have deceived them?</b>

320
00:21:06,096 --> 00:21:07,507
<b>Is that not tactless?</b>

321
00:21:07,906 --> 00:21:09,937
<b>You didn't warn me in advance.</b>

322
00:21:10,106 --> 00:21:12,177
<b>I even asked you not to tell anyone.</b>

323
00:21:12,177 --> 00:21:14,406
<b>What can I do when
I want to brag to everyone?</b>

324
00:21:14,406 --> 00:21:16,277
<b>Think about the others too.</b>

325
00:21:16,576 --> 00:21:19,417
<b>Did you have to do that
in front of him and Sol Ah?</b>

326
00:21:19,417 --> 00:21:20,417
<b>Who?</b>

327
00:21:21,517 --> 00:21:24,386
<b>Bang Guk Bong? What about him?</b>

328
00:21:24,457 --> 00:21:25,787
<b>Whatever.</b>

329
00:21:26,187 --> 00:21:28,326
<b>I know about them too.</b>

330
00:21:28,326 --> 00:21:29,896
<b>That it's a tough relationship.</b>

331
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:33,167
<b>You knew as well?</b>

332
00:21:33,197 --> 00:21:35,796
<b>So I invited them on purpose.</b>

333
00:21:35,796 --> 00:21:36,997
<b>So they wouldn't have to hide.</b>

334
00:21:37,237 --> 00:21:38,467
<b>It's not a crime.</b>

335
00:21:38,467 --> 00:21:41,437
<b>They aren't related by blood
and it's legally okay as well.</b>

336
00:21:45,306 --> 00:21:47,106
<b>Do you think I don't think at all?</b>

337
00:21:47,606 --> 00:21:49,606
<b>Before telling Mom and Dad about us,</b>

338
00:21:49,606 --> 00:21:51,546
<b>I thought about it long and hard.</b>

339
00:21:51,717 --> 00:21:53,787
<b>However hard I thought,
there was only one conclusion.</b>

340
00:21:54,517 --> 00:21:57,787
<b>That Mom and Dad would like you.</b>

341
00:21:58,717 --> 00:22:01,356
<b>Why should you
feel bad about liking me?</b>

342
00:22:01,727 --> 00:22:05,556
<b>If you knew how much
I like you, you'd get so arrogant.</b>

343
00:22:07,527 --> 00:22:09,296
<b>How can I show you how I feel?</b>

344
00:22:11,037 --> 00:22:12,636
<b>Should I kiss you?</b>

345
00:22:17,677 --> 00:22:18,677
<b>No?</b>

346
00:22:19,806 --> 00:22:21,247
<b>Is it not that kind of mood?</b>

347
00:22:21,247 --> 00:22:22,507
<b>Am I being tactless...</b>

348
00:22:34,626 --> 00:22:35,687
<b>You're tall.</b>

349
00:23:09,156 --> 00:23:11,697
<b>You acted cute to make me teach you,</b>

350
00:23:12,197 --> 00:23:13,366
<b>and you're bored already?</b>

351
00:23:18,437 --> 00:23:20,566
<b>It looked fascinating,
but it's not fun.</b>

352
00:23:20,967 --> 00:23:22,007
<b>Like you.</b>

353
00:23:23,707 --> 00:23:27,106
<b>Human business
isn't as easy as it seems.</b>

354
00:23:34,316 --> 00:23:36,187
<b>Is Sol Ah working late again?</b>

355
00:23:42,687 --> 00:23:43,896
<b>- This is nice.
- This one.</b>

356
00:23:43,896 --> 00:23:45,296
<b>- That too.
- Which one?</b>

357
00:23:45,296 --> 00:23:46,326
<b>What do you think?</b>

358
00:23:48,126 --> 00:23:50,437
<b>There are many kinds of cats.</b>

359
00:23:51,267 --> 00:23:52,937
<b>- Won't this work?
- This and this?</b>

360
00:23:52,997 --> 00:23:54,237
<b>Put that higher.</b>

361
00:24:01,406 --> 00:24:02,507
<b>(Gosh...)</b>

362
00:24:18,227 --> 00:24:20,427
<b>Hong Jo, I'm off to work!</b>

363
00:24:21,227 --> 00:24:22,396
<b>Just a moment.</b>

364
00:24:23,896 --> 00:24:24,997
<b>I'll walk you.</b>

365
00:24:24,997 --> 00:24:26,707
<b>What for? It's cold out.</b>

366
00:24:26,707 --> 00:24:28,066
<b>Stay indoors where it's warm.</b>

367
00:24:48,457 --> 00:24:49,826
<b>(Why would I eat alone?
You're so mean.)</b>

368
00:25:14,217 --> 00:25:15,217
<b>(Why would I eat alone?
You're so mean.)</b>

369
00:25:49,517 --> 00:25:50,656
<b>Do you want some coffee?</b>

370
00:25:53,626 --> 00:25:54,886
<b>You were right.</b>

371
00:25:55,326 --> 00:25:57,757
<b>Caffeine really does
bring your time forward.</b>

372
00:25:58,826 --> 00:26:01,396
<b>I rarely say what isn't
right or true.</b>

373
00:26:03,366 --> 00:26:05,396
<b>I think I sped up my time too much.</b>

374
00:26:06,437 --> 00:26:07,707
<b>What do you mean?</b>

375
00:26:10,076 --> 00:26:12,876
<b>I'm just saying you were right.</b>

376
00:26:14,247 --> 00:26:17,846
<b>That it wouldn't be easy
being around Sol Ah as a human.</b>

377
00:26:20,116 --> 00:26:21,346
<b>That was right too.</b>

378
00:26:23,787 --> 00:26:26,086
<b>The man who collected cats.</b>

379
00:26:27,427 --> 00:26:29,386
<b>I don't want to become like him,</b>

380
00:26:30,257 --> 00:26:31,757
<b>but I keep wanting more.</b>

381
00:26:32,197 --> 00:26:33,366
<b>I want to be with her.</b>

382
00:26:34,727 --> 00:26:36,796
<b>I want Sol Ah to do well,</b>

383
00:26:38,037 --> 00:26:40,767
<b>and I thought I'd be happy
if she were happy.</b>

384
00:26:43,876 --> 00:26:46,977
<b>I feel sad that I don't think
I'm part of her happiness.</b>

385
00:26:51,046 --> 00:26:52,947
<b>That's what
being with someone is like.</b>

386
00:26:55,417 --> 00:26:56,987
<b>You shut each other in or out,</b>

387
00:26:58,086 --> 00:26:59,787
<b>and sometimes become alone.</b>

388
00:27:00,626 --> 00:27:02,656
<b>Is this what you feared?</b>

389
00:27:03,056 --> 00:27:04,527
<b>I get it now that it happened to me.</b>

390
00:27:06,227 --> 00:27:08,527
<b>It must've been hard being a human.</b>

391
00:27:10,437 --> 00:27:11,697
<b>But I guess...</b>

392
00:27:13,066 --> 00:27:16,207
<b>you managed pretty well, Jae Seon.</b>

393
00:27:17,076 --> 00:27:19,336
<b>Stop being cheeky
and finish what you're doing.</b>

394
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:27,987
<b>I won't see you for a while now.</b>

395
00:27:31,787 --> 00:27:33,116
<b>I'll spend some time at home.</b>

396
00:27:33,586 --> 00:27:35,656
<b>Is your father not doing well?</b>

397
00:27:37,257 --> 00:27:38,697
<b>It's only for a few days.</b>

398
00:27:40,126 --> 00:27:42,527
<b>Don't get too excited that
no one will be watching you.</b>

399
00:27:46,537 --> 00:27:48,806
<b>(Nalsaem Design)</b>

400
00:27:52,406 --> 00:27:54,046
<b>The cat from last time.</b>

401
00:27:55,806 --> 00:27:58,316
<b>Look, there's a cat on the bench.</b>

402
00:27:58,316 --> 00:27:59,977
<b>I wasn't mistaken.</b>

403
00:28:00,346 --> 00:28:02,846
<b>Why do you keep talking about a cat?</b>

404
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:08,156
<b>Hey. The coffee beggar is back.</b>

405
00:28:08,626 --> 00:28:11,396
<b>Wow, that's really weird.</b>

406
00:28:11,697 --> 00:28:13,667
<b>There was definitely a cat there.</b>

407
00:28:13,896 --> 00:28:15,066
<b>Last time too.</b>

408
00:28:33,447 --> 00:28:34,447
<b>Are you okay?</b>

409
00:28:36,417 --> 00:28:37,417
<b>What do you mean?</b>

410
00:28:37,886 --> 00:28:39,487
<b>Are you sick?</b>

411
00:28:39,886 --> 00:28:41,326
<b>What if like last time...</b>

412
00:28:41,326 --> 00:28:42,427
<b>It's not like that.</b>

413
00:28:43,326 --> 00:28:45,156
<b>The sun was nice and warm.</b>

414
00:28:47,796 --> 00:28:50,566
<b>You dressed up today.</b>

415
00:28:51,537 --> 00:28:53,866
<b>You wore something pretty.</b>

416
00:28:54,336 --> 00:28:56,267
<b>Are you sitting here
to seduce someone?</b>

417
00:28:56,606 --> 00:28:58,106
<b>I have something for you.</b>

418
00:28:58,406 --> 00:28:59,937
<b>It won't take long.</b>

419
00:29:00,146 --> 00:29:03,207
<b>Drink your coffee and wait.
I get off work early today.</b>

420
00:29:03,447 --> 00:29:04,447
<b>Okay.</b>

421
00:29:27,737 --> 00:29:29,566
<b>- Ms. Park, I...
- Any evening plans?</b>

422
00:29:29,566 --> 00:29:31,677
<b>- I was...
- If you do, cancel it.</b>

423
00:29:32,237 --> 00:29:34,447
<b>The client asked for
an emergency meeting.</b>

424
00:29:35,177 --> 00:29:37,876
<b>The project's almost done,
so don't mess up at the last minute.</b>

425
00:29:37,876 --> 00:29:39,447
<b>All three of you must be there.</b>

426
00:29:40,046 --> 00:29:41,616
<b>- But I...
- Okay.</b>

427
00:29:41,816 --> 00:29:42,816
<b>Okay.</b>

428
00:29:49,156 --> 00:29:51,296
<b>- Hello?
- Hey, Hong Jo.</b>

429
00:29:52,296 --> 00:29:55,396
<b>I'm sorry. Something urgent came up.</b>

430
00:29:56,027 --> 00:29:58,997
<b>You should wait for me at home.
I'll be there as soon as I'm done.</b>

431
00:29:59,997 --> 00:30:02,406
<b>Okay, don't worry about me
and get back to work.</b>

432
00:30:03,537 --> 00:30:04,576
<b>Bye.</b>

433
00:30:39,876 --> 00:30:43,616
<b>We did some market research
about your target customers.</b>

434
00:30:43,977 --> 00:30:46,816
<b>Here are some materials
you can look at for reference.</b>

<b>(Hong Jo)</b>

436
00:30:49,247 --> 00:30:51,017
<b>Instead of using
expensive packaging,</b>

437
00:30:51,187 --> 00:30:53,116
<b>we should keep it simple
and comfortable to look at.</b>

438
00:30:53,116 --> 00:30:57,457
<b>And I think it'll be better
to let people see the origin.</b>

439
00:31:08,467 --> 00:31:09,737
<b>I'm working.</b>

440
00:31:17,146 --> 00:31:19,346
<b>We switched the design and color
to a much simpler one...</b>

441
00:31:19,717 --> 00:31:22,517
<b>just like what you asked us to do
over the phone.</b>

442
00:31:23,346 --> 00:31:27,126
<b>And like we told you earlier,
we tried to make it brighter.</b>

443
00:31:59,856 --> 00:32:01,916
<b>- Well done.
- Thank you.</b>

444
00:32:19,205 --> 00:32:20,275
<b>Welcome back.</b>

445
00:32:20,676 --> 00:32:22,036
<b>Why are you here?</b>

446
00:32:22,575 --> 00:32:25,146
<b>It's dark out and it's raining.</b>

447
00:32:33,155 --> 00:32:34,755
<b>Hey, you...</b>

448
00:32:38,486 --> 00:32:39,896
<b>You're so cold.</b>

449
00:32:39,996 --> 00:32:41,956
<b>How long were you in the rain?</b>

450
00:32:42,896 --> 00:32:44,596
<b>Sol Ah, I have...</b>

451
00:32:44,596 --> 00:32:46,765
<b>I told you to wait at home.</b>

452
00:32:47,136 --> 00:32:49,036
<b>Why are you like this?</b>

453
00:32:51,206 --> 00:32:52,606
<b>I was thinking of you.</b>

454
00:32:52,606 --> 00:32:54,835
<b>You come to my workplace
and get rained on.</b>

455
00:32:55,305 --> 00:32:56,905
<b>How is that thinking of me?</b>

456
00:32:57,206 --> 00:32:59,276
<b>Aren't you acting out
to get noticed?</b>

457
00:32:59,916 --> 00:33:01,176
<b>I just...</b>

458
00:33:02,945 --> 00:33:03,986
<b>Yes.</b>

459
00:33:04,915 --> 00:33:07,986
<b>Even then, if that's what it takes,</b>

460
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:09,656
<b>can't you focus on me?</b>

461
00:33:11,255 --> 00:33:15,055
<b>Yes, I know I haven't been
the same these days.</b>

462
00:33:15,055 --> 00:33:17,626
<b>I'm sorry. But later on...</b>

463
00:33:17,626 --> 00:33:18,965
<b>Later when?</b>

464
00:33:18,995 --> 00:33:20,566
<b>I don't have the time.</b>

465
00:33:22,965 --> 00:33:24,066
<b>Yes.</b>

466
00:33:25,605 --> 00:33:27,576
<b>A cat only lives for the day.</b>

467
00:33:28,005 --> 00:33:29,846
<b>That's how we spent time together.</b>

468
00:33:30,505 --> 00:33:31,775
<b>Like a cat.</b>

469
00:33:32,245 --> 00:33:34,215
<b>Focusing just on that very day.</b>

470
00:33:34,215 --> 00:33:36,316
<b>I'm not doing this for my sake.</b>

471
00:33:36,786 --> 00:33:39,355
<b>It's about us. I drew us.</b>

472
00:33:40,316 --> 00:33:42,956
<b>More people will read it
if it becomes a regular webtoon.</b>

473
00:33:43,385 --> 00:33:44,855
<b>I want more people to see it,</b>

474
00:33:44,855 --> 00:33:46,826
<b>and I don't want them to
ridicule me.</b>

475
00:33:47,255 --> 00:33:49,255
<b>I want to make them smile.</b>

476
00:33:51,025 --> 00:33:52,766
<b>Like you made me smile.</b>

477
00:33:54,835 --> 00:33:56,236
<b>But I don't want...</b>

478
00:33:56,236 --> 00:33:59,066
<b>people to think
I put work second to my webtoon.</b>

479
00:34:00,005 --> 00:34:01,736
<b>I didn't mean to disturb you.</b>

480
00:34:01,736 --> 00:34:03,346
<b>You're...</b>

481
00:34:06,215 --> 00:34:10,146
<b>It's too hard for me
if you're always waiting for me.</b>

482
00:34:11,416 --> 00:34:13,215
<b>You said you have
something to do as well.</b>

483
00:34:14,215 --> 00:34:15,756
<b>Give me a little time.</b>

484
00:34:18,125 --> 00:34:20,956
<b>So, what I mean is...</b>

485
00:34:25,095 --> 00:34:26,935
<b>Don't wait for me.</b>

486
00:34:30,305 --> 00:34:31,465
<b>Are you serious?</b>

487
00:34:34,835 --> 00:34:36,946
<b>The time I can spend as a human...</b>

488
00:34:38,606 --> 00:34:39,946
<b>is predestined?</b>

489
00:34:42,745 --> 00:34:44,715
<b>Waiting is what a cat does.</b>

490
00:34:45,986 --> 00:34:47,715
<b>And you don't want me to
do that too?</b>

491
00:34:55,125 --> 00:34:56,595
<b>You're getting wet.</b>

492
00:34:57,726 --> 00:34:58,896
<b>I'll use my own umbrella.</b>

493
00:35:03,035 --> 00:35:04,465
<b>What I could do for you.</b>

494
00:35:05,405 --> 00:35:06,606
<b>What I couldn't do for you.</b>

495
00:35:08,305 --> 00:35:09,805
<b>I wanted to do it all.</b>

496
00:35:10,206 --> 00:35:12,176
<b>You're doing fine right now.</b>

497
00:35:12,946 --> 00:35:14,245
<b>It's more than enough.</b>

498
00:35:18,386 --> 00:35:21,085
<b>You'll catch a cold.
Let's hurry home.</b>

499
00:35:57,326 --> 00:35:59,055
<b>Dad. Are you all right?</b>

500
00:36:01,226 --> 00:36:02,256
<b>I'm fine.</b>

501
00:36:06,196 --> 00:36:07,796
<b>I'm just dying.</b>

502
00:36:10,405 --> 00:36:11,506
<b>You may be...</b>

503
00:36:11,905 --> 00:36:15,605
<b>the owner of a small cafe
and workshop,</b>

504
00:36:15,936 --> 00:36:17,806
<b>but you're a mess.</b>

505
00:36:18,105 --> 00:36:19,775
<b>Do you want money to buy clothes?</b>

506
00:36:19,775 --> 00:36:21,576
<b>No, it's fine.</b>

507
00:36:22,415 --> 00:36:23,715
<b>Dad.</b>

508
00:36:24,485 --> 00:36:25,485
<b>Here.</b>

509
00:36:26,915 --> 00:36:28,155
<b>Take it.</b>

510
00:36:28,956 --> 00:36:31,556
<b>I even took in that old cat for you.</b>

511
00:36:37,566 --> 00:36:39,295
<b>Is there anywhere you want to go?</b>

512
00:36:40,295 --> 00:36:41,436
<b>No.</b>

513
00:36:41,965 --> 00:36:43,636
<b>Anything you want to eat then?</b>

514
00:36:43,905 --> 00:36:45,905
<b>There's nowhere I haven't been...</b>

515
00:36:46,136 --> 00:36:48,006
<b>and nothing I haven't eaten.</b>

516
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:50,905
<b>Everything I wanted, I had or did.</b>

517
00:36:52,915 --> 00:36:56,146
<b>The one thing
I thought I didn't have...</b>

518
00:36:57,116 --> 00:36:59,316
<b>came to me at the last minute.</b>

519
00:37:02,485 --> 00:37:03,525
<b>But...</b>

520
00:37:05,925 --> 00:37:07,256
<b>even I...</b>

521
00:37:08,056 --> 00:37:10,326
<b>can't control or keep time.</b>

522
00:37:11,725 --> 00:37:13,595
<b>This thing called time.</b>

523
00:37:16,506 --> 00:37:18,706
<b>It never waits for you.</b>

524
00:37:53,576 --> 00:37:55,235
<b>Hong Jo.</b>

525
00:38:00,516 --> 00:38:01,715
<b>Hong Jo.</b>

526
00:38:27,076 --> 00:38:28,235
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

527
00:38:31,545 --> 00:38:32,915
<b>Give me a little time.</b>

528
00:38:35,915 --> 00:38:39,215
<b>- Great job!
- Well done, guys.</b>

529
00:38:40,616 --> 00:38:43,025
<b>You know what? I'm talking here.</b>

530
00:38:43,025 --> 00:38:45,025
<b>Seeing you three work together...</b>

531
00:38:45,256 --> 00:38:46,826
<b>- made me so anxious.
- Ms. Park.</b>

532
00:38:46,826 --> 00:38:48,025
<b>- Thanks.
- But then,</b>

533
00:38:48,025 --> 00:38:50,496
<b>you pulled it off and I'm glad.</b>

534
00:38:50,496 --> 00:38:52,725
<b>The three of them
get along pretty well.</b>

535
00:38:52,725 --> 00:38:53,795
<b>- Right?
- Yes.</b>

536
00:38:53,795 --> 00:38:55,196
<b>- Well done.
- It's all because...</b>

537
00:38:55,196 --> 00:38:57,006
<b>- you're a great leader, Ms. Park!
- Yes.</b>

538
00:38:57,006 --> 00:38:58,066
<b>That's right.</b>

539
00:38:59,235 --> 00:39:01,535
<b>- Thank you.
- Eat all you want.</b>

540
00:39:01,535 --> 00:39:03,275
<b>- Let's eat.
- Well done.</b>

541
00:39:03,506 --> 00:39:04,845
<b>- Okay.
- Thank you.</b>

542
00:39:05,206 --> 00:39:07,446
<b>How's your other project going?</b>

543
00:39:07,545 --> 00:39:10,886
<b>- I have a lot of experience.
- See, dating...</b>

544
00:39:11,485 --> 00:39:13,556
<b>Have you heard from
the webtoon person?</b>

545
00:39:13,715 --> 00:39:14,715
<b>No.</b>

546
00:39:15,285 --> 00:39:18,386
<b>- I thought they'd call this week.
- By the way...</b>

547
00:39:18,886 --> 00:39:20,496
<b>I guess it's not happening.</b>

548
00:39:21,396 --> 00:39:23,465
<b>(Sonamu)</b>

<b>Hey. Hong Jo.</b>

552
00:40:33,695 --> 00:40:34,836
<b>Guess what?</b>

553
00:40:35,136 --> 00:40:37,606
<b>Cats don't show they're sick
even when they are.</b>

554
00:40:38,106 --> 00:40:39,976
<b>- For fear of abandonment.
- Really?</b>

555
00:40:41,236 --> 00:40:44,106
<b>My wife doesn't tell me
if she's sick too.</b>

556
00:40:44,606 --> 00:40:47,976
<b>When I'm busy, I pretend
not to notice even though I do.</b>

557
00:40:47,976 --> 00:40:51,716
<b>Can't she get sick on my schedule?</b>

558

<b>- You're so mean.
- That's wrong.</b>

<b>- You're nasty.
- That's terrible.</b>

560
00:41:01,055 --> 00:41:02,195
<b>What happened?</b>

561
00:41:03,065 --> 00:41:05,025
<b>A broken mirror's a bad omen.</b>

562
00:41:05,425 --> 00:41:07,366
<b>- Are you okay?
- Yes.</b>

563
00:41:09,035 --> 00:41:10,506
<b>- No, I'll do it.
- It's okay.</b>

564
00:41:11,236 --> 00:41:12,935

<b>I...</b>

<b>I... I made it.</b>

570
00:41:50,205 --> 00:41:52,305
<b>- They'll run your webtoon?
- Yes!</b>

00:41:53,146 --> 00:41:54,146
<b>Sol Ah!</b>

572
00:41:56,146 --> 00:41:58,246
<b>Congratulations. I'm so happy!</b>

573
00:41:58,386 --> 00:42:01,116
<b>What did I say?
I said they'd like it!</b>

574
00:42:02,815 --> 00:42:04,525
<b>You said yes yesterday.</b>

<b>Okay, fine.</b>

577

<b>Hide it before your mom comes home.</b>

578
00:42:15,136 --> 00:42:16,935
<b>- Drive safely.

<b>This is so heavy.</b>

580
00:42:22,705 --> 00:42:23,775
<b>What's this?</b>

581
00:42:24,106 --> 00:42:26,075
<b>Rice cakes. Take it with you.</b>

582

<b>Sol Ah will officially debut

<b>Gosh, my back hurts.</b>

585

<b>I need to see a Chinese doctor.

<b>- What now?
- I don't know.</b>

<b>- Shoot.
- What's this?</b>

589
00:42:42,396 --> 00:42:46,025
<b>What's going on that made you

<b>Well...</b>

591
00:42:50,435 --> 00:42:51,736
<b>- Be careful.
- My gosh.</b>

592
00:42:51,736 --> 00:42:53,736
<b>This is really heavy.</b>

593
00:42:53,736 --> 00:42:54,775
<b>I told you to be careful.</b>

594
00:42:54,775 --> 00:42:57,606
<b>Don't you think
you need the car to take this?</b>

595
00:42:57,606 --> 00:42:59,846
<b>- Yes, I do.
- I carried it back from the market.</b>

<b>Who said I'm worried about him?</b>

<b>And what? You make me

<b>Am I someone who shoots daggers

<b>Why do you keep me out?

<b>My goodness.</b>

621

<b>Who would call you old-fashioned?</b>

<b>You're so sophisticated.</b>

623
00:44:25,325 --> 00:44:27,866
<b>Where are you hurting? Here?</b>

624
00:44:28,236 --> 00:44:30,935
<b>Don't you touch me.
I'll go to an acupuncturist.</b>

625
00:44:30,935 --> 00:44:32,665
<b>Yes, acupuncture's good.
Here, was it?</b>

626
00:44:32,665 --> 00:44:34,575
<b>- I'll give you a massage.
- My gosh.</b>

627
00:44:34,876 --> 00:44:37,275
<b>- Look. Why is he coming back?
- What's wrong?</b>

628
00:44:39,075 --> 00:44:40,175
<b>Did he forget something?</b>

629
00:44:42,575 --> 00:44:43,945
<b>- What's wrong?
- What is it?</b>

630
00:44:43,945 --> 00:44:45,086
<b>- What is it?
- Well...</b>

631
00:44:46,045 --> 00:44:47,116
<b>This is for you.</b>

632
00:44:47,116 --> 00:44:48,216
<b>(Devoted Mr. Gogalbi)</b>

633
00:44:48,785 --> 00:44:49,915
<b>What's this?</b>

634
00:44:49,986 --> 00:44:53,896
<b>I heard that you wanted to
change your sign.</b>

635
00:44:54,055 --> 00:44:55,655
<b>I gave it a go.</b>

636
00:44:57,295 --> 00:44:59,126
<b>You drew this yourself?</b>

637
00:44:59,596 --> 00:45:02,096
<b>- My goodness!
- What?</b>

638
00:45:02,596 --> 00:45:04,836
<b>I like the current sign
that Doo Sik drew...</b>

639
00:45:04,836 --> 00:45:07,435
<b>I still am not used to
the current sign.</b>

640
00:45:07,435 --> 00:45:09,435
<b>It gives me the chills
whenever I look at it.</b>

641
00:45:09,675 --> 00:45:11,905
<b>- It's all bones.
- Right?</b>

642
00:45:13,146 --> 00:45:15,246
<b>It looks terrifying!</b>

643
00:45:16,075 --> 00:45:17,185
<b>Look at this.</b>

644
00:45:17,785 --> 00:45:20,285
<b>The eyes look so fresh and lively.</b>

645
00:45:20,486 --> 00:45:22,155
<b>- Gosh.
- They glisten.</b>

646
00:45:22,155 --> 00:45:25,055
<b>This mackerel could
jump off the page.</b>

647
00:45:26,925 --> 00:45:27,996
<b>Thank you.</b>

648
00:45:28,925 --> 00:45:30,966
<b>I'm glad you like it.</b>

649
00:45:31,626 --> 00:45:33,096
<b>What I like the most...</b>

650
00:45:33,695 --> 00:45:37,506
<b>is well-boiled bracken, you see.</b>

651
00:45:37,905 --> 00:45:40,905
<b>When you cook bracken with mackerel,</b>

652
00:45:42,205 --> 00:45:44,545
<b>it becomes so soft and tender.</b>

653
00:45:44,545 --> 00:45:46,606
<b>It's just delicious.</b>

654
00:45:46,945 --> 00:45:49,045
<b>- It's delicious.
- Yes, it is.</b>

655
00:45:49,116 --> 00:45:52,945
<b>Bracken and mackerel are
a match made in paradise.</b>

656
00:45:52,945 --> 00:45:54,856
<b>- Right. A perfect match.
- Yes.</b>

657
00:45:54,856 --> 00:45:56,685
<b>That's right. They suit each other.</b>

658
00:45:58,925 --> 00:45:59,925
<b>Lovely.</b>

659
00:45:59,925 --> 00:46:02,226
<b>Hey, let's just have a few beers.</b>

660
00:46:02,226 --> 00:46:05,226
<b>We don't have to throw a party.
You are too extreme.</b>

661
00:46:07,035 --> 00:46:08,596
<b>We don't need balloons.</b>

662
00:46:08,736 --> 00:46:12,836
<b>Ji Eun. I think all the red balloons
are grouped together.</b>

663
00:46:12,836 --> 00:46:15,136
<b>- These?
- Yes. Spread them out.</b>

664
00:46:15,535 --> 00:46:18,045
<b>Move them this way.
Yes, that's it. Great.</b>

665
00:46:18,976 --> 00:46:22,075
<b>We really don't need balloons, guys.</b>

666
00:46:22,075 --> 00:46:23,545
<b>You're too crazy.</b>

667
00:46:31,525 --> 00:46:32,555
<b>Breathe this in.</b>

668
00:46:35,825 --> 00:46:36,896
<b>Guys.</b>

669
00:46:42,496 --> 00:46:43,736
<b>Me too.</b>

670
00:46:46,976 --> 00:46:48,435
<b>I want some coffee.</b>

671
00:46:50,675 --> 00:46:54,516
<b>(Sonamu)</b>

672
00:47:07,856 --> 00:47:09,325
<b>Come out. I know you're there.</b>

673
00:47:18,736 --> 00:47:19,905
<b>What do you want?</b>

674
00:47:29,045 --> 00:47:30,146
<b>Where's the cat?</b>

675
00:47:31,986 --> 00:47:33,915
<b>I've been watching.</b>

676
00:47:35,116 --> 00:47:36,986
<b>I haven't seen the cat.</b>

677
00:47:38,525 --> 00:47:39,626
<b>It's none of your business.</b>

678
00:47:40,756 --> 00:47:43,126
<b>I want to check something.</b>

679
00:47:43,126 --> 00:47:44,165
<b>I think...</b>

680
00:47:45,596 --> 00:47:47,295
<b>I saw something.</b>

681
00:47:51,035 --> 00:47:52,736
<b>Does that girl know that...</b>

682
00:47:54,476 --> 00:47:55,575
<b>I saw?</b>

683
00:47:57,945 --> 00:47:59,846
<b>Shall I go and ask her?</b>

684
00:47:59,846 --> 00:48:01,045
<b>Don't touch Sol Ah.</b>

685
00:48:24,065 --> 00:48:25,935
<b>Her occupation.</b>

686
00:48:27,136 --> 00:48:28,535
<b>Did you say she was a designer?</b>

687
00:48:42,756 --> 00:48:43,886
<b>Darn.</b>

688
00:48:49,925 --> 00:48:51,466
<b>Watch out, here.</b>

689
00:48:51,466 --> 00:48:53,665
<b>- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.</b>

690
00:48:53,665 --> 00:48:55,195
<b>- Congratulations!
- Thank you.</b>

691
00:48:55,195 --> 00:48:56,966
<b>Shouldn't you give us an autograph?</b>

692
00:48:56,966 --> 00:48:58,966
<b>You didn't have to do this for me.</b>

693
00:48:58,966 --> 00:49:01,675
<b>Thank you all for coming
such a long way.</b>

694
00:49:01,876 --> 00:49:06,276
<b>Also, thanks to you two for always
drawing with me all this time.</b>

695
00:49:06,475 --> 00:49:09,445
<b>And I'm always thankful to you too.</b>

696
00:49:10,146 --> 00:49:11,386
<b>But...</b>

697
00:49:11,685 --> 00:49:14,715
<b>where is the person
I'm most thankful to?</b>

698
00:49:16,755 --> 00:49:20,126
<b>Oh. Please excuse me.</b>

699
00:49:21,396 --> 00:49:23,225
<b>Doo Sik, you spattered it
all over my face.</b>

700
00:49:23,225 --> 00:49:24,566
<b>Why don't we sit down and eat?</b>

701
00:49:36,675 --> 00:49:38,106
<b>What are you doing here?</b>

702
00:49:38,576 --> 00:49:40,646
<b>You look like a dog
protecting a house.</b>

703
00:49:42,475 --> 00:49:45,485
<b>Why did you come outside? Everyone
is here to congratulate you.</b>

704
00:49:45,485 --> 00:49:46,886
<b>Aren't you going to congratulate me?</b>

705
00:49:47,086 --> 00:49:48,816
<b>That hug you gave me last time,
was that all?</b>

706
00:49:49,056 --> 00:49:50,955
<b>You didn't even bring a flower?</b>

707
00:49:50,955 --> 00:49:53,126
<b>All you can do with your hands
is hug me?</b>

708
00:50:07,405 --> 00:50:08,505
<b>Congratulations.</b>

709
00:50:09,175 --> 00:50:10,175
<b>What is...</b>

710
00:50:11,745 --> 00:50:13,876
<b>I was just joking.</b>

711
00:50:20,316 --> 00:50:21,985
<b>Did you make this yourself?</b>

712
00:50:21,985 --> 00:50:23,586
<b>You can put your phone in there.</b>

713
00:50:23,586 --> 00:50:25,185
<b>Since you forget it all the time.</b>

714
00:50:26,455 --> 00:50:28,695
<b>It was okay since
you always took care of me.</b>

715
00:50:31,126 --> 00:50:33,026
<b>If I can't use my hands anymore...</b>

716
00:50:33,225 --> 00:50:34,265
<b>What?</b>

717
00:50:36,566 --> 00:50:40,405
<b>I just meant your clumsiness
is getting way out of hand.</b>

718
00:50:40,405 --> 00:50:41,536
<b>Gosh.</b>

719
00:50:42,776 --> 00:50:46,776
<b>Oh, you said you had something
to give me last time.</b>

720
00:50:48,346 --> 00:50:49,715
<b>This is what it was.</b>

721
00:50:51,185 --> 00:50:52,646
<b>You said you had something to do.</b>

722
00:50:53,586 --> 00:50:55,655
<b>You were thinking about me
all the time.</b>

723
00:50:55,786 --> 00:50:58,626
<b>I told you waiting
is what a cat does.</b>

724
00:50:59,455 --> 00:51:02,155
<b>Go on inside.
I'll be waiting here.</b>

725
00:51:04,465 --> 00:51:05,465
<b>Come with me.</b>

726
00:51:12,306 --> 00:51:14,836
<b>Last time when I drank
with Jae Seon...</b>

727
00:51:14,836 --> 00:51:16,306
<b>Ji Eun, this tastes great.</b>

728
00:51:17,776 --> 00:51:19,846
<b>Hey, where were you?</b>

729
00:51:20,175 --> 00:51:21,675
<b>Wait, it's the coffee beggar.</b>

730
00:51:22,276 --> 00:51:23,685
<b>- Beggar?
- I don't know.</b>

731
00:51:23,685 --> 00:51:26,886
<b>Hold on, what is going on
between you two?</b>

732
00:51:27,116 --> 00:51:29,786
<b>- Is he your boyfriend?
- I have something to ask.</b>

733
00:51:29,786 --> 00:51:32,185
<b>Did you see a cat on the bench
near our company?</b>

734
00:51:32,185 --> 00:51:33,925
<b>Stop saying that.</b>

735
00:51:33,925 --> 00:51:37,096
<b>I'm certain I saw a white cat
sleeping on the bench.</b>

736
00:51:37,096 --> 00:51:40,536
<b>But when I looked again,
it was you. It happened twice.</b>

737
00:51:41,165 --> 00:51:43,596
<b>By any chance, are you a cat?</b>

738
00:51:44,566 --> 00:51:46,336
<b>He does kind of look like a cat.</b>

739
00:51:46,336 --> 00:51:48,376
<b>Wait, Sol Ah looks like a dog.</b>

740
00:51:48,475 --> 00:51:51,905
<b>Gosh, you two
don't look good together.</b>

741
00:51:54,116 --> 00:51:57,745
<b>Sol Ah, it must be tough for you
to go out with a cat.</b>

742
00:51:57,745 --> 00:52:00,116
<b>I have to make money for my kid's
diapers and dry milk,</b>

743
00:52:00,116 --> 00:52:02,155
<b>but you have to make money
for cat litter and food.</b>

744
00:52:02,155 --> 00:52:04,056
<b>He turns into a human,</b>

745
00:52:04,056 --> 00:52:06,356
<b>so he'll probably be able to make
money for his litter and food.</b>

746
00:52:06,356 --> 00:52:07,755
<b>What is your job?</b>

747
00:52:09,856 --> 00:52:11,225
<b>I don't have a job.</b>

748
00:52:13,126 --> 00:52:15,465
<b>Oh, I know why.</b>

749
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:18,235
<b>That's understandable
since he looks young.</b>

750
00:52:18,935 --> 00:52:20,136
<b>How old are you?</b>

751
00:52:20,606 --> 00:52:21,705
<b>One.</b>

752
00:52:27,975 --> 00:52:30,076
<b>So you really are a cat.</b>

753
00:52:32,086 --> 00:52:33,086
<b>Right.</b>

754
00:52:37,056 --> 00:52:39,026
<b>What's with this mood?</b>

755
00:52:39,155 --> 00:52:41,925
<b>Bang Guk Bong is a bit strange.
That's his charm.</b>

756
00:52:41,925 --> 00:52:44,826
<b>What did you just say?
His name is...</b>

757
00:52:44,826 --> 00:52:47,765
<b>Did you just say "Bang Guk Bong"?</b>

758
00:52:47,765 --> 00:52:49,235
<b>I didn't hear wrong, did I?</b>

759
00:52:49,265 --> 00:52:51,306
<b>What a unique name.</b>

760
00:52:51,306 --> 00:52:54,175
<b>You must've been teased a lot
when you were young.</b>

761
00:52:54,175 --> 00:52:55,636
<b>"Bang Guk Bong, Bang Guk Bong."</b>

762
00:52:57,975 --> 00:53:00,876
<b>He's not Bang Guk Bong.</b>

763
00:53:02,945 --> 00:53:04,286
<b>He's Hong Jo.</b>

764
00:53:06,286 --> 00:53:07,286
<b>Hong Jo?</b>

765
00:53:08,316 --> 00:53:10,316
<b>Why are you calling him Hong Jo?</b>

766
00:53:10,316 --> 00:53:11,356
<b>Hong Jo is...</b>

767
00:53:12,356 --> 00:53:13,356
<b>Wait.</b>

768
00:53:14,725 --> 00:53:15,826
<b>Who was it?</b>

769
00:53:16,326 --> 00:53:18,195
<b>I heard that name a lot somewhere.</b>

770
00:53:18,265 --> 00:53:19,396
<b>Did you change your name?</b>

771
00:53:25,665 --> 00:53:27,175
<b>Let me introduce him.</b>

772
00:53:28,336 --> 00:53:31,505
<b>He was the first to recognize
my drawings.</b>

773
00:53:32,046 --> 00:53:33,405
<b>He liked them...</b>

774
00:53:33,745 --> 00:53:36,846
<b>and helped me to continue to draw.</b>

775
00:53:36,876 --> 00:53:39,046
<b>He's the one I feel
the most thankful to.</b>

776
00:53:40,955 --> 00:53:43,015
<b>And he's the person I love.</b>

777
00:53:45,225 --> 00:53:46,886
<b>How romantic.</b>

778
00:53:51,326 --> 00:53:53,066
<b>- Shall we say cheers?
- Yes.</b>

779
00:53:53,066 --> 00:53:54,136
<b>Let's get up.</b>

780
00:53:57,665 --> 00:53:59,205
<b>Sol Ah, congratulations!</b>

781
00:53:59,205 --> 00:54:00,405
<b>- Thank you!
- Congratulations!</b>

782
00:54:00,405 --> 00:54:01,606
<b>- Congratulations!
- Congratulations!</b>

783
00:54:07,576 --> 00:54:10,215
<b>You two look so good together.</b>

784
00:54:10,316 --> 00:54:11,546
<b>I envy you.</b>

785
00:54:13,745 --> 00:54:15,155
<b>Why aren't you drinking?</b>

786
00:54:15,955 --> 00:54:17,185
<b>I have to drive later.</b>

787
00:54:17,185 --> 00:54:18,526
<b>Your webtoon is so fun.</b>

788
00:54:18,526 --> 00:54:20,056
<b>Really? Thank you.</b>

789
00:54:20,056 --> 00:54:21,155
<b>I'm really enjoying it.</b>

790
00:54:21,155 --> 00:54:22,556
<b>I still have a long way to go.</b>

791
00:54:23,965 --> 00:54:25,695
<b>How long have you been going out?</b>

792
00:54:26,765 --> 00:54:27,765
<b>We've been...</b>

793
00:54:28,096 --> 00:54:31,965
<b>- I envy you. I'm so jealous.
- Me too.</b>

794
00:54:31,965 --> 00:54:33,705
<b>Oh, the cake. Hong Jo.</b>

795
00:54:34,106 --> 00:54:35,776
<b>There's a cake inside.
Can you go bring it?</b>

796
00:54:35,776 --> 00:54:37,505
<b>Oh, okay.</b>

797
00:54:38,846 --> 00:54:40,245
<b>He's charming.</b>

798
00:54:40,245 --> 00:54:41,876
<b>I agree with you.</b>

799
00:54:41,876 --> 00:54:42,945
<b>Shall I go with you?</b>

800
00:54:42,945 --> 00:54:44,945
<b>No need, it's just a cake.</b>

801
00:54:45,215 --> 00:54:46,485
<b>Okay.</b>

802
00:55:14,745 --> 00:55:16,445
<b>How's your father doing?</b>

803
00:55:17,485 --> 00:55:18,945
<b>He's feeling much better.</b>

804
00:55:19,586 --> 00:55:21,685
<b>The doctors at the hospital
are even surprised.</b>

805
00:55:21,886 --> 00:55:22,985
<b>I'm glad.</b>

806
00:55:23,485 --> 00:55:25,586
<b>I guess he feels better
since you're beside him now.</b>

807
00:55:26,925 --> 00:55:28,225
<b>Thanks to him.</b>

808
00:55:29,356 --> 00:55:30,495
<b>Are you going somewhere?</b>

809
00:55:30,556 --> 00:55:32,366
<b>We're going to the East Sea
to see the sunrise.</b>

810
00:55:32,366 --> 00:55:33,465
<b>Jeongdongjin?</b>

811
00:55:33,465 --> 00:55:35,866
<b>There's a place in front of
a bed and breakfast in Jeongdongjin.</b>

812
00:55:35,866 --> 00:55:37,366
<b>- It's the perfect spot.
- Really?</b>

813
00:55:37,366 --> 00:55:40,435
<b>But if you go now, it will be hard
for you to find a spot.</b>

814
00:55:40,435 --> 00:55:42,106
<b>You have to hurry
since there are so many people.</b>

815
00:55:42,106 --> 00:55:43,136
<b>How do I go?</b>

816
00:55:43,205 --> 00:55:45,046
<b>Oh, I know.</b>

817
00:55:45,076 --> 00:55:46,276
<b>- You do?
- Yes.</b>

818
00:55:46,675 --> 00:55:49,116
<b>- We better get going.
- What?</b>

819
00:55:49,116 --> 00:55:50,316
<b>We're going to the East Sea
to see the sunrise.</b>

820
00:55:50,316 --> 00:55:51,386
<b>You should stay a bit more.</b>

821
00:55:51,386 --> 00:55:53,086
<b>We can't see it if we don't go now.</b>

822
00:55:53,086 --> 00:55:54,286
<b>- Let's go.
- Hey.</b>

823
00:55:54,286 --> 00:55:55,286
<b>- See you.
- Be careful.</b>

824
00:55:55,286 --> 00:55:56,485
<b>- Congratulations.
- Thanks.</b>

825
00:55:56,485 --> 00:55:57,655
<b>Drive carefully.</b>

826
00:55:57,856 --> 00:55:59,856
<b>- Goodness.
- He's in such a hurry.</b>

827
00:56:01,155 --> 00:56:02,856
<b>- I envy them.
- Me too.</b>

828
00:56:18,205 --> 00:56:19,205
<b>Hong Jo.</b>

829
00:56:28,185 --> 00:56:29,755
<b>Hong Jo.</b>

830
00:56:34,195 --> 00:56:35,925
<b>What happened?</b>

831
00:56:36,455 --> 00:56:38,096
<b>Everyone's waiting.</b>

832
00:56:47,836 --> 00:56:49,136
<b>Don't tell me...</b>

833
00:56:52,205 --> 00:56:53,846
<b>you can't turn back into a human.</b>

834
00:57:00,386 --> 00:57:01,755
<b>Why isn't he coming out?</b>

835
00:57:02,255 --> 00:57:03,886
<b>I told you, he's a cat.</b>

836
00:57:03,886 --> 00:57:06,685
<b>He likes to hide in a corner
when there are strangers around.</b>

837
00:57:07,056 --> 00:57:10,495
<b>I'm sorry, but something urgent
came up.</b>

838
00:57:10,965 --> 00:57:12,296
<b>Sol Ah, is that...</b>

839
00:57:12,296 --> 00:57:14,296
<b>Don't come out. Just stay with them.</b>

840
00:57:14,296 --> 00:57:17,066
<b>I'm sorry. You can continue
with the party without me.</b>

841
00:57:17,296 --> 00:57:20,005
<b>- But...
- Okay, bye.</b>

842
00:57:36,116 --> 00:57:37,316
<b>What are you doing here?</b>

843
00:57:37,316 --> 00:57:38,455
<b>Is that...</b>

844
00:57:40,056 --> 00:57:41,126
<b>a cat?</b>

845
00:57:41,856 --> 00:57:42,896
<b>Move.</b>

846
00:57:43,155 --> 00:57:44,165
<b>Wait.</b>

847
00:57:44,866 --> 00:57:46,425
<b>Can you show me for a second?</b>

848
00:57:46,465 --> 00:57:49,136
<b>Hong Jo is sick.
He needs to go to the vet. Move.</b>

849
00:57:49,136 --> 00:57:50,265
<b>I...</b>

850
00:57:50,665 --> 00:57:52,806
<b>lost all my cats...</b>

851
00:57:53,606 --> 00:57:54,975
<b>because of you people.</b>

852
00:57:55,935 --> 00:57:57,076
<b>Mister.</b>

853
00:57:58,776 --> 00:58:00,945
<b>You're not in your right mind
right now.</b>

854
00:58:02,376 --> 00:58:05,985
<b>That's what everyone says.
All I did was love my cats,</b>

855
00:58:05,985 --> 00:58:07,215
<b>but they say my love...</b>

856
00:58:08,886 --> 00:58:09,915
<b>is an illness.</b>

857
00:58:11,786 --> 00:58:12,856
<b>I...</b>

858
00:58:14,155 --> 00:58:18,626
<b>really saw that cat turn into
a person. I'm sure I saw it.</b>

859
00:58:19,665 --> 00:58:22,695
<b>But no one believes me.</b>

860
00:58:22,935 --> 00:58:25,836
<b>They all think I'm mad.
That's why...</b>

861
00:58:26,265 --> 00:58:27,606
<b>I will prove it.</b>

862
00:58:29,106 --> 00:58:30,846
<b>That I'm not crazy.</b>

863
00:58:35,646 --> 00:58:36,715
<b>Transform.</b>

864
00:58:37,816 --> 00:58:39,445
<b>- Transform.
- No!</b>

865
00:58:39,445 --> 00:58:41,086
<b>- Stop, Mister!
- Transform.</b>

866
00:58:41,086 --> 00:58:42,286
<b>Transform.</b>

867
00:58:43,356 --> 00:58:45,326
<b>- Turn into a human.
- Mister!</b>

868
00:58:45,755 --> 00:58:47,626
<b>Transform. Transform.</b>

869
00:58:50,396 --> 00:58:51,566
<b>Will you change now?</b>

870
00:58:51,925 --> 00:58:53,596
<b>Transform. Transform.</b>

871
00:58:54,066 --> 00:58:55,165
<b>Transform!</b>

872
00:59:22,425 --> 00:59:25,366
<b>(Welcome)</b>

873
00:59:25,566 --> 00:59:28,136
<b>- I wanted to hug you.
- You don't have to be human.</b>

874
00:59:28,136 --> 00:59:29,566
<b>Do you want me to stay a cat?</b>

875
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:32,935
<b>Is turning into a human
making him sick?</b>

876
00:59:33,106 --> 00:59:35,475
<b>Sol Ah has to live like a human,</b>

877
00:59:35,475 --> 00:59:37,076
<b>but she sleeps all day like a cat.</b>

878
00:59:37,076 --> 00:59:38,205
<b>Can you not change?</b>

879
00:59:38,205 --> 00:59:41,116
<b>The time I can spend as a human
is getting shorter and shorter.</b>

880
00:59:41,245 --> 00:59:42,475
<b>Stay close to me.</b>

881
00:59:43,215 --> 00:59:44,316
<b>Is it too late?</b>

882
00:59:44,316 --> 00:59:46,116
<b>He's mostly a cat these days.</b>

883
00:59:46,485 --> 00:59:47,816
<b>This will be the last time.</b>

884
00:59:47,816 --> 00:59:49,685
<b>You said you'd be human around me.</b>

885
00:59:50,086 --> 00:59:51,725
<b>I'll stay with you.</b>
