<b>What are you doing?</b>

6
00:00:31,004 --> 00:00:32,338
<b>Let me go.</b>

7
00:00:33,589 --> 00:00:35,174

<b>I didn't see how it would help train me.</b>

11

<b>But now, I've realized

<b>Chief Choi, if this is Director Gu's trap,</b>

13

<b>there's a chance

What could that be?</b>

15

<b>Me.</b>

16
00:01:42,116 --> 00:01:44,494
<b>It crossed my mind
that he kidnapped Dr. Oh</b>

17
00:01:44,744 --> 00:01:46,996
<b>because he is after my artificial eyes.</b>

18

<b>I'm a rare success case.</b>

19

<b>I will pay them back for everything.</b>

23

<b>Where are they now?</b>

24
00:02:26,953 --> 00:02:27,954
<b>Hold on.</b>

25
00:02:38,089 --> 00:02:39,090
<b>I can't stand this.</b>

26

<b>You didn't have a chance

<b>I can disinfect it later.

<b>To me, this comes first.</b>

<b>You seem pretty experienced with this.</b>

<b>A third of my body consists

<b>Of course, I'm an expert compared to you.</b>

32

<b>Try moving it.</b>

33
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:41,736

<b>All right. You're up.</b>

37

<b>Since you're up, why don't we use
this chance to get to know one another?</b>

38
00:04:11,682 --> 00:04:13,059
<b>Here's my first question.</b>

39
00:04:13,809 --> 00:04:15,144
<b>Where is this truck going?</b>

40
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:30,743
<b>Here's my second question.</b>

41
00:04:31,452 --> 00:04:33,246
<b>What's this sewer smell?</b>

42
00:04:33,829 --> 00:04:35,206
<b>What did you transport?</b>

43
00:04:46,842 --> 00:04:48,970
<b>Look at you.
That's why I told not to move.</b>

44
00:04:50,012 --> 00:04:53,349
<b>Here's my third question.
This is based on what I saw.</b>

45
00:04:53,599 --> 00:04:55,476
<b>Give me a straight answer.</b>

46
00:04:55,977 --> 00:04:58,312
<b>What are you doing with people you kidnap?</b>

47
00:05:04,068 --> 00:05:04,902
<b>Did you just laugh?</b>

48
00:05:12,159 --> 00:05:14,412
<b>I'll especially ask you
the fourth question.</b>

49
00:05:14,912 --> 00:05:17,832
<b>You know the spray you used
on me earlier? Where's that?</b>

50
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:26,966
<b>-Here it is.
-No.</b>

51
00:05:27,967 --> 00:05:28,926
<b>Now, you can talk?</b>

52
00:05:29,552 --> 00:05:30,970
<b>Spare me.</b>

53
00:05:32,471 --> 00:05:33,556
<b>Spare you?</b>

54
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,267
<b>When people begged you to spare them,</b>

55
00:05:37,143 --> 00:05:38,769
<b>was there a time
you ever listened to them?</b>

56
00:05:49,989 --> 00:05:51,449
<b>Back to my first question.</b>

57
00:05:51,949 --> 00:05:53,993
<b>Where is this truck going?</b>

58
00:05:56,996 --> 00:05:58,706
<b>You only need your mouth to answer me.</b>

59
00:06:16,724 --> 00:06:18,267
<b>You prick, what took you so long?</b>

60
00:06:34,617 --> 00:06:35,618
<b>Gwang-cheol!</b>

61
00:06:40,206 --> 00:06:41,957
<b>This can't make a scar on me with this.</b>

62
00:06:50,883 --> 00:06:52,468
<b>Why did you break the drone?</b>

63
00:06:52,551 --> 00:06:54,303
<b>It did its duty by saving you.</b>

64
00:06:55,846 --> 00:06:58,015
<b>-Are you all right?
-If I rest a bit.</b>

65
00:07:00,184 --> 00:07:02,019
<b>-Where's Tae-woong?
-He came with me.</b>

66
00:07:02,978 --> 00:07:03,979
<b>Let's go.</b>

67
00:07:22,998 --> 00:07:26,335
<b>Answer me. Where is the truck going?</b>

68
00:07:51,026 --> 00:07:52,236
<b>Choose.</b>

69
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,115
<b>Will you let your head get blown up
or try to remember the plate number?</b>

70
00:07:56,282 --> 00:07:57,742
<b>Two, four, seven, eight.</b>

71
00:07:57,992 --> 00:08:00,411
<b>No, is it two, four, seven, nine.</b>

72
00:08:17,386 --> 00:08:18,429
<b>Tae-woong.</b>

73
00:08:18,512 --> 00:08:20,931
<b>-Are you okay?
-I can handle it.</b>

74
00:08:21,015 --> 00:08:22,683
<b>He was the lookout instead of the drone.</b>

75
00:08:23,517 --> 00:08:25,770
<b>-Did you have a lot to take care of?
-No, not really.</b>

76
00:08:27,855 --> 00:08:29,899
<b>I don't think Gi-beom made it out.</b>

77
00:08:30,983 --> 00:08:31,984
<b>I know.</b>

78
00:08:32,943 --> 00:08:34,528
<b>But he's not an easy match.</b>

79
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:37,323
<b>We'll focus on our task for now.</b>

80
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:41,160
<b>Do you even know where you're going?</b>

81
00:08:41,827 --> 00:08:45,039
<b>I can tell that he does.
He's indeed my team leader.</b>

82
00:09:08,437 --> 00:09:11,398
<b>-The roses are in full bloom today.
-Right.</b>

83
00:09:11,941 --> 00:09:14,401
<b>-They look beautiful, don't they?
-Let's put them here.</b>

84
00:09:15,486 --> 00:09:18,280
<b>But I was worried, you know.
In case they got cold.</b>

85
00:09:20,825 --> 00:09:23,160
<b>-What about this one?
-Over there.</b>

86
00:09:31,961 --> 00:09:34,547
<b><i>Did you enjoy the festival last time?</i></b>

87
00:09:35,172 --> 00:09:36,882
<b><i>Before you sign the contract,</i></b>

88
00:09:36,966 --> 00:09:40,469
<b><i>I'd like to hear how you're going
to eliminate Hwang Deuk-gu in detail.</i></b>

89
00:09:48,394 --> 00:09:50,521
<b>Ma'am, how about these plates?</b>

90
00:09:51,605 --> 00:09:54,400
<b>They look beautiful. I like both of them.</b>

91
00:09:55,317 --> 00:09:57,862
<b>I actually picked out a plate.
Let me show it to you.</b>

92
00:09:57,945 --> 00:09:59,154
<b>-Sounds great.
-Wait here.</b>

93
00:09:59,238 --> 00:10:00,406
<b>Sure.</b>

94
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,253
<b>What do you think you're--</b>

95
00:10:20,426 --> 00:10:21,719
<b>Why are you doing this?</b>

96
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:24,096
<b>Kang Gi-beom.</b>

97
00:10:24,763 --> 00:10:25,639
<b>Kang Gi-beom?</b>

98
00:10:26,348 --> 00:10:27,558
<b>What?</b>

99
00:10:28,934 --> 00:10:31,353
<b>Did you think you wouldn't get caught?</b>

100
00:10:34,648 --> 00:10:35,649
<b>You...</b>

101
00:10:51,624 --> 00:10:53,751
<b>I thought you already knew
I wanted you dead.</b>

102
00:10:55,544 --> 00:10:58,172
<b>Of course, I knew. I knew it very well.</b>

103
00:10:58,255 --> 00:10:59,798
<b>Then, it's nothing to get upset about.</b>

104
00:11:00,841 --> 00:11:03,427
<b>What? Were you scared
that you might get killed?</b>

105
00:11:05,638 --> 00:11:06,513
<b>If that's not it,</b>

106
00:11:08,432 --> 00:11:11,435
<b>are you jealous that I was secretly
working with Kang Gi-beom?</b>

107
00:11:14,772 --> 00:11:15,856
<b>What are you</b>

108
00:11:17,733 --> 00:11:19,818
<b>-talking about?
-I asked you if you were jealous.</b>

109
00:11:19,902 --> 00:11:22,446
<b>That's a load of crap.</b>

110
00:11:22,529 --> 00:11:25,115
<b>If you wanted, you could have
killed me on many occasions.</b>

111
00:11:25,199 --> 00:11:26,200
<b>Why didn't you?</b>

112
00:11:28,494 --> 00:11:29,662
<b>I doubt that</b>

113
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,247
<b>my assets made you hesitate.</b>

114
00:11:43,425 --> 00:11:44,969
<b>I can sort of see why.</b>

115
00:11:47,846 --> 00:11:48,847
<b>It's because you like me.</b>

116
00:12:11,829 --> 00:12:14,748
<b>Get away from her.
I'll only warn you once.</b>

117
00:12:22,131 --> 00:12:25,092
<b>Both of you are out of control.</b>

118
00:12:26,844 --> 00:12:28,887
<b>Did you set this up
knowing I would be here?</b>

119
00:12:28,971 --> 00:12:30,222
<b>I hear things, too.</b>

120
00:12:30,931 --> 00:12:32,391
<b>Of course, I picked up a few things.</b>

121
00:12:35,644 --> 00:12:36,562
<b>That's right.</b>

122
00:12:37,062 --> 00:12:38,063
<b>Shoot me.</b>

123
00:12:39,565 --> 00:12:42,735
<b>Get rid of that tacky silencer.
And just fire it away!</b>

124
00:12:42,818 --> 00:12:44,278
<b>You don't think I can't?</b>

125
00:12:50,909 --> 00:12:53,662
<b>The staff outside is Chairman Hyeon's.</b>

126
00:12:54,663 --> 00:12:56,957
<b>Nothing good will come out
of displaying our dispute.</b>

127
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:03,630
<b>You are a vice-chairman, after all.</b>

128
00:13:04,089 --> 00:13:05,632
<b>Behave like one.</b>

129
00:13:11,889 --> 00:13:12,890
<b>Ms. Choi.</b>

130
00:13:22,107 --> 00:13:24,151
<b>I thought it was too heavy

131

<b>I couldn't find the one I wanted.
I'll be out shortly.</b>

132
00:13:27,863 --> 00:13:28,697
<b>Okay.</b>

133
00:14:05,025 --> 00:14:07,027
<b>What's that jerk, Dr. Oh, doing?</b>

134

<b>Don't pretend you're that innocent.</b>

135
00:14:26,088 --> 00:14:27,714
<b>I'm sure you've seen worse.</b>

136
00:14:27,798 --> 00:14:30,134
<b>And must I mention
you've done worse as well?</b>

137
00:14:30,217 --> 00:14:31,301
<b>You have</b>

138
00:14:32,803 --> 00:14:33,762
<b>changed a lot.</b>

139
00:14:35,514 --> 00:14:36,807
<b>I didn't change.</b>

140
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:37,850
<b>I adapted.</b>

141
00:14:39,101 --> 00:14:40,435
<b>I'm sure you will adapt quickly.</b>

142

<b>Don't expect me to help you in any way

<b>All right, then.</b>

159
00:16:07,606 --> 00:16:10,734
<b>Are you telling me your fancy artificial

160
00:16:11,318 --> 00:16:13,487
<b>It was Kang Gi-beom who survived them.</b>

161
00:16:14,154 --> 00:16:16,114
<b>He overcame the fear of death</b>

167

172
00:16:56,613 --> 00:16:59,574
<b>The truck with the plate number, 2478,

176
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,926
<b>The truck suddenly changed its direction.</b>

177
00:17:22,681 --> 00:17:24,057
<b>Let's follow the truck for now.</b>

178
00:17:25,142 --> 00:17:26,518
<b>They were telling me the truth.</b>

179
00:17:27,102 --> 00:17:30,772
<b>Their heads were about to explode.
Of course, they'd tell the truth.</b>

180

<b>I would've done the same.</b>

181
00:17:32,816 --> 00:17:35,610
<b>What? No, you would let your head explode.</b>

182
00:17:35,694 --> 00:17:38,322
<b>Look at you. Now that you're confident
about your defense,</b>

183
00:17:38,447 --> 00:17:40,741
<b>I guess getting beaten up
doesn't scare you anymore.</b>

184
00:17:40,824 --> 00:17:42,200
<b>Right. Definitely.</b>

185
00:17:42,617 --> 00:17:44,661
<b>He makes a good shield.</b>

186
00:17:45,329 --> 00:17:46,705
<b>Well, that was original.</b>

187
00:17:47,706 --> 00:17:50,542
<b>You should specialize in that

188

<b>I'm not modest

189
00:17:54,463 --> 00:17:55,964

190
00:17:56,173 --> 00:17:57,674
<b>I'll continue to be on the lookout.</b>

191

<b>-Hello.
-How long will it take?</b>

194

<b>It's 10,000 won as long as it fits.</b>

195

<b>Come and check out these clothes.</b>

196
00:18:50,227 --> 00:18:52,396
<b>This place looks pretty normal to me.</b>

197

<b>I shouldn't have broken the drone.</b>

198

<b>-Let's split and look for him.
-Okay.</b>

200
00:19:31,893 --> 00:19:34,271

201
00:19:57,544 --> 00:19:58,962
<b>Look at you transforming.</b>

202
00:19:59,963 --> 00:20:02,007
<b>What? Are you happy to be back home?</b>

203
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:01,066

205
00:21:14,037 --> 00:21:14,996
<b>Are you all right?</b>

206
00:21:16,289 --> 00:21:17,290

<b>-What?
-Smoke is coming out.</b>

213
00:22:26,985 --> 00:22:29,321

214

<b>CHAIRMAN HYEON</b>

<b>My gosh.
It's been a while, Chairman Hyeon.</b>

217

219
00:23:19,204 --> 00:23:20,705
<b>What will you do if I actually did it?</b>

220
00:23:20,789 --> 00:23:21,873
<b>What?</b>

221
00:23:21,956 --> 00:23:24,501
<b>Why did you ignore my warning?</b>

<b>-Do you know what this land was for?
-<i>I sure do.</i></b>

223

00:32:33,843 --> 00:32:36,054
<b>If you want to organize your toys,</b>

305
00:32:36,137 --> 00:32:39,224
<b>you have to take them all out first
to start afresh.</b>

306
00:32:39,307 --> 00:32:42,727
<b>All these sacrifices
for something stupid like that?</b>

307
00:32:42,810 --> 00:32:43,811
<b>Take him.</b>

308
00:32:58,243 --> 00:32:59,369
<b>You should get some rest too.</b>

309
00:32:59,452 --> 00:33:01,537
<b>But I didn't do anything, Boss.</b>

310
00:33:01,621 --> 00:33:03,581
<b>I brought that idiot here,</b>

311
00:33:04,082 --> 00:33:05,667
<b>but you let Min-jun handle him.</b>

312
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:07,210
<b>I'm your right-hand man,</b>

313
00:33:07,293 --> 00:33:09,545
<b>yet I couldn't even take charge
on this important day.</b>

314
00:33:09,629 --> 00:33:12,507
<b>So? Did that hurt your feelings?</b>

315
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:16,970
<b>Or are you pissed off because you feel
like you're being pushed to the sidelines?</b>

316
00:33:17,178 --> 00:33:20,014
<b>-That's not what I meant, Boss.
-Don't ever forget this.</b>

317
00:33:23,434 --> 00:33:27,897
<b>We'll lose the big things if we obsess
over such little things. Both you and I.</b>

318
00:33:31,859 --> 00:33:33,945
<b>We must never forget</b>

319
00:33:36,114 --> 00:33:37,740
<b>who I used to be.</b>

320
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:40,826
<b>Welcome to your world, Hwang Deuk-gu.</b>

321
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:43,162
<b><i>-Was it you?
-No. Us.</i></b>

322
00:33:45,498 --> 00:33:46,874
<b><i>And shoot.</i></b>

323
00:33:48,209 --> 00:33:49,335
<b><i>I can sort of see why.</i></b>

324
00:33:50,003 --> 00:33:52,088
<b>It's because you like me.</b>

325
00:33:53,965 --> 00:33:55,425
<b>I will show you</b>

326
00:33:56,926 --> 00:33:59,637
<b>what I'm capable of.</b>

327
00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:05,560
<b>I have no appetite.</b>

328
00:34:07,562 --> 00:34:10,648
<b>We have no idea
when Hwang Deuk-gu will act up again.</b>

329
00:34:10,732 --> 00:34:13,276
<b>You should've just killed him in one blow.</b>

330
00:34:16,404 --> 00:34:19,324
<b>I know I'm the one who taught you,
but it's not nice to be lectured.</b>

331
00:34:20,450 --> 00:34:21,284
<b>Yes.</b>

332
00:34:21,826 --> 00:34:23,369
<b>Neither of us</b>

333
00:34:23,786 --> 00:34:26,289
<b>should get blood on our hands.</b>

334
00:34:27,248 --> 00:34:29,834
<b>All we need to do is
make them hold the knife.</b>

335
00:34:30,418 --> 00:34:32,962
<b>They'll fight and kill each other.</b>

336
00:34:33,046 --> 00:34:34,047
<b>Exactly.</b>

337
00:34:35,423 --> 00:34:36,924
<b>And we'll live.</b>

338
00:34:40,053 --> 00:34:41,804
<b>Then he's probably dead.</b>

339
00:34:43,348 --> 00:34:44,432
<b>Who?</b>

340
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,602
<b>Never mind. Just someone.</b>

341
00:34:50,063 --> 00:34:51,481
<b>Ye-won, that being said...</b>

342
00:34:51,647 --> 00:34:52,982
<b>In my opinion--</b>

343
00:34:55,777 --> 00:34:57,320
<b>What brings you by at this hour?</b>

344
00:34:57,612 --> 00:34:59,572
<b>You didn't watch the news?</b>

345
00:35:00,031 --> 00:35:01,574
<b>The news? Did something happen?</b>

346
00:35:01,657 --> 00:35:05,828
<b>Gosh, that bastard sent his boys
and caused a huge scene at the park.</b>

347
00:35:05,912 --> 00:35:08,956
<b>-"That bastard"? Who?
-Hwang Deuk-gu.</b>

348
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,501
<b>I invested so much to build
an apartment complex by the park,</b>

349
00:35:11,584 --> 00:35:14,087
<b>but that asshole totally ruined my plan.</b>

350
00:35:14,170 --> 00:35:17,006
<b>I mean, who'd want to live there now?</b>

351
00:35:17,256 --> 00:35:18,132
<b>My gosh.</b>

352
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,927
<b>Wait until things quiet down.</b>

353
00:35:24,389 --> 00:35:25,598
<b>What?</b>

354
00:35:26,682 --> 00:35:28,142
<b>I make all the decisions.</b>

355
00:35:30,103 --> 00:35:32,563
<b>If you need fast cash, I'll help you out.</b>

356
00:35:38,277 --> 00:35:41,948
<b>Look at you acting all generous and giving
with Chairman Ko's money.</b>

357
00:35:42,448 --> 00:35:44,158
<b>Enjoy it while it lasts.</b>

358
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:49,038
<b>If you have another money source,
go ahead and mobilize it.</b>

359
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:53,209
<b>Then your position will be threatened.</b>

360
00:35:54,627 --> 00:35:57,171
<b>You said we should help each other out.</b>

361
00:35:57,255 --> 00:36:01,300
<b>Are you trying to say
it's every man for himself now?</b>

362
00:36:01,384 --> 00:36:02,677
<b>Just so you know,</b>

363
00:36:04,929 --> 00:36:07,515
<b>I don't like loud fights.</b>

364
00:36:30,538 --> 00:36:32,123
<b>Is your arm okay?</b>

365
00:36:32,999 --> 00:36:34,584
<b>Yes, it's fine.</b>

366
00:36:36,502 --> 00:36:39,130
<b>But you seem upset.</b>

367
00:36:43,885 --> 00:36:45,094
<b>Earlier at the park,</b>

368
00:36:46,387 --> 00:36:49,765
<b>we saved an injured man and asked
the police to take him to the hospital.</b>

369
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:54,312
<b>But he was actually a member of Argos
disguised as one of the victims.</b>

370
00:36:57,273 --> 00:36:58,733
<b>While I was looking away,</b>

371
00:36:59,275 --> 00:37:01,068
<b>he shot two police officers.</b>

372
00:37:02,778 --> 00:37:05,323
<b>We've seen them do shit like that
a number of times.</b>

373
00:37:06,032 --> 00:37:07,742
<b>I know that it's nothing surprising,</b>

374
00:37:08,951 --> 00:37:10,453
<b>but getting blindsided like that...</b>

375
00:37:11,662 --> 00:37:12,955
<b>It just doesn't feel nice.</b>

376
00:37:13,789 --> 00:37:16,959
<b>Right, that's what made me so furious
back when I was a detective.</b>

377
00:37:17,335 --> 00:37:20,588
<b>Bastards like them
even take advantage of your sincerity.</b>

378
00:37:22,131 --> 00:37:24,217
<b>I found it unforgivable.</b>

379
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:25,801
<b>Exactly.</b>

380
00:37:26,344 --> 00:37:28,471
<b>That's what makes you really angry.</b>

381
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:33,726
<b>By the way, when did you get that?</b>

382
00:37:34,977 --> 00:37:35,978
<b>When I was young.</b>

383
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:39,065
<b>-I got it done because I wanted to.
-What?</b>

384
00:37:39,941 --> 00:37:41,651
<b>Oh, to survive?</b>

385
00:37:44,779 --> 00:37:47,031
<b>"This is where I belong."</b>

386
00:37:47,114 --> 00:37:50,076
<b>I guess I thought I needed
to separate myself from the world.</b>

387
00:37:50,743 --> 00:37:52,787
<b>They probably didn't want
to let you go easily.</b>

388
00:37:55,581 --> 00:37:58,751
<b>This is how I paid for my sister's life.</b>

389
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:04,715
<b>Why did you want to join Rugal?</b>

390
00:38:05,383 --> 00:38:07,176
<b>Because Rugal was after me.</b>

391
00:38:07,552 --> 00:38:09,554
<b>I thought I should join the enemy</b>

392
00:38:09,637 --> 00:38:12,431
<b>to completely separate myself
from those bastards.</b>

393
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:15,977
<b>Simple and concise. I like that answer.</b>

394
00:38:19,313 --> 00:38:20,690
<b>When I first came here,</b>

395
00:38:21,524 --> 00:38:23,359
<b>your name was all over the news.</b>

396
00:38:25,194 --> 00:38:28,447
<b>"The psychopath cop who murdered people."
Things like that?</b>

397
00:38:28,531 --> 00:38:30,992
<b>Even back then,
I didn't believe any of it.</b>

398
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:34,537
<b>You'd never do such a thing.</b>

399
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,207
<b>You see, I don't open up easily.</b>

400
00:38:38,291 --> 00:38:41,627
<b>Once I trust someone,
I totally confide in that person.</b>

401
00:38:43,504 --> 00:38:44,338
<b>I'm the same way.</b>

402
00:38:47,049 --> 00:38:50,219
<b>How about we have some beer
when you're done with that?</b>

403
00:38:51,387 --> 00:38:52,221
<b>Sounds good.</b>

404
00:38:59,145 --> 00:39:02,607
<b>Hey, "Made by Bradley." It was awesome.</b>

405
00:39:03,065 --> 00:39:05,401
<b>Gosh, that's nothing.</b>

406
00:39:05,484 --> 00:39:08,779
<b>I made other things too.
I'll show you later.</b>

407
00:39:08,863 --> 00:39:12,033
<b>"Later"? Why later? Show me now.</b>

408
00:39:12,199 --> 00:39:13,618
<b>Okay, I'll show you.</b>

409
00:39:14,201 --> 00:39:15,661
<b>Okay, aim.</b>

410
00:39:16,203 --> 00:39:17,371
<b>Here I go.</b>

411
00:39:17,955 --> 00:39:20,041
<b>One, two, three!</b>

412
00:39:24,587 --> 00:39:25,504
<b>You saw that?</b>

413
00:39:25,588 --> 00:39:28,257
<b>That's like a lion's roar.</b>

414
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:31,761
<b>If it works properly,</b>

415
00:39:31,844 --> 00:39:34,430
<b>you can completely destroy
your enemy with it.</b>

416
00:39:34,930 --> 00:39:37,600
<b>Okay, it's a keeper. What's next?</b>

417
00:39:38,225 --> 00:39:39,477
<b>-Something else?
-Yes.</b>

418
00:39:40,061 --> 00:39:42,063
<b>Jeez, you're such a gearhead.</b>

419
00:39:43,064 --> 00:39:45,191
<b>Hey, are you ready to spend some cash?</b>

420
00:39:45,274 --> 00:39:46,359
<b>Of course.</b>

421
00:39:46,442 --> 00:39:48,527
<b>Right, you're rich.</b>

422
00:39:48,611 --> 00:39:49,820
<b>Okay, I'll show you.</b>

423
00:39:49,904 --> 00:39:50,946
<b>Go.</b>

424
00:39:58,913 --> 00:40:01,248
<b>It'll take a while
for the wound to close up.</b>

425
00:40:01,332 --> 00:40:02,958
<b>You know I'm not the most patient person.</b>

426
00:40:03,042 --> 00:40:04,543
<b>Wait until you're fully recovered.</b>

427
00:40:06,212 --> 00:40:07,421
<b>I can work while recovering.</b>

428
00:40:08,422 --> 00:40:10,508
<b>It's not like
we have all this time to waste.</b>

429
00:40:10,591 --> 00:40:13,177
<b>You're strong enough.
You don't need to act all tough.</b>

430
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:15,513
<b>Had I actually been strong enough,</b>

431
00:40:16,472 --> 00:40:19,934
<b>I would've beat them all up
and dragged Hwang Deuk-gu by the collar.</b>

432
00:40:21,936 --> 00:40:25,106
<b>And I'm sure you were hoping for that,
deep down.</b>

433
00:40:34,865 --> 00:40:36,450
<b>I'm always grateful to you.</b>

434
00:40:38,452 --> 00:40:40,579
<b>After my father passed away,</b>

435
00:40:40,663 --> 00:40:43,582
<b>everyone pitied me.</b>

436
00:40:44,333 --> 00:40:48,003
<b>But you were always tough on me.</b>

437
00:40:50,214 --> 00:40:52,133
<b>To be honest,
it hurt my feelings a lot at first.</b>

438
00:40:54,927 --> 00:40:56,804
<b>But I quickly realized</b>

439
00:40:58,681 --> 00:41:00,891
<b>that I had to be tough to survive.</b>

440
00:41:02,393 --> 00:41:05,688
<b>And that I must survive
to get back at those bastards.</b>

441
00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:10,693
<b>There were a lot of emotions
you had to digest all by yourself.</b>

442
00:41:40,473 --> 00:41:41,474
<b>POLICE UNIVERSITY</b>

443
00:43:04,306 --> 00:43:05,641
<b>No...</b>

444
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:07,476
<b>Gosh.</b>

445
00:43:07,685 --> 00:43:09,228
<b>Dad.</b>

446
00:43:16,819 --> 00:43:18,320
<b>Dad.</b>

447
00:43:19,071 --> 00:43:22,157
<b>Dad...</b>

448
00:43:40,134 --> 00:43:41,468
<b><i>Why was my dad</i></b>

449

<b><i>working at this university lab

450
00:43:48,851 --> 00:43:50,895
<b><i>What the heck was he working on?</i></b>

451
00:43:53,147 --> 00:43:55,065
<b>And why did he die?</b>

452
00:43:59,236 --> 00:44:00,321
<b>Your dad</b>

<b>killed him.</b>

458
00:44:20,257 --> 00:44:22,217
<b>His funeral will be kept confidential.</b>

459
00:44:23,552 --> 00:44:25,220
<b>Not many will be invited.</b>

460
00:44:26,138 --> 00:44:27,681
<b>Because he's a failure,</b>

461
00:44:28,015 --> 00:44:29,934
<b>his death must be kept a secret?</b>

462
00:44:32,269 --> 00:44:34,146
<b>But he was working for the police.</b>

463
00:44:40,194 --> 00:44:41,945
<b>What about the bastard who killed my dad?</b>

464
00:44:42,029 --> 00:44:43,322
<b>We'll do our best</b>

465
00:44:44,114 --> 00:44:46,200
<b>to track down the culprit,</b>

466
00:44:46,283 --> 00:44:48,410
<b>but he worked on a classified project.</b>

467
00:44:48,494 --> 00:44:51,830
<b>The investigation will be sacrificed
for the sake of keeping it hidden.</b>

468
00:44:51,914 --> 00:44:54,750
<b>You won't do your best
in order to catch my dad's killer?</b>

469
00:44:54,833 --> 00:44:57,836
<b>Then I'll find the bastard

470
00:44:59,588 --> 00:45:02,925
<b>Making a move before you're strong enough</b>

471
00:45:03,425 --> 00:45:04,927
<b>will only hurt you.</b>

472
00:45:05,010 --> 00:45:06,470
<b>Then wait and see</b>

473
00:45:08,347 --> 00:45:09,515
<b>how much I get hurt.</b>

474
00:45:13,185 --> 00:45:14,436
<b>Name?</b>

475
00:45:15,854 --> 00:45:17,064
<b>Name, you prick!</b>

476
00:45:18,649 --> 00:45:21,485
<b>Hey, let's grab a cup of coffee sometime.</b>

477
00:45:23,654 --> 00:45:24,488
<b>Have a good one.</b>

478
00:45:40,504 --> 00:45:42,423
<b><i>At first, I ignored your warning</i></b>

479
00:45:42,506 --> 00:45:44,508
<b><i>and took matters into my own hands.</i></b>

480
00:45:44,591 --> 00:45:47,136
<b><i>It led to my demise.</i></b>

481
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:50,472
<b>Then I made a vow in front of you.</b>

482
00:45:52,474 --> 00:45:54,768
<b>I will never
let my emotions sway me again.</b>

483
00:45:58,981 --> 00:46:01,191
<b>If only I was a human weapon though.</b>

484
00:46:01,650 --> 00:46:03,402
<b>If I'm injured again,</b>

485
00:46:03,819 --> 00:46:06,655
<b>please make me part-robot like the others.</b>

486
00:46:07,281 --> 00:46:09,658
<b>Being too strong could break you.</b>

487
00:46:09,742 --> 00:46:12,494
<b>-I'm not afraid of that.
-Mi-na...</b>

488
00:46:12,578 --> 00:46:14,580
<b>But still, you worry about me.</b>

489
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:20,252
<b>I guess it proves
your lack of trust in me.</b>

490
00:46:20,711 --> 00:46:21,837
<b>That's not it.</b>

491
00:46:23,505 --> 00:46:25,215
<b>Then say this instead.</b>

492
00:46:25,799 --> 00:46:27,009
<b>"Get well soon.</b>

493
00:46:27,551 --> 00:46:28,969
<b>We still have a lot to do.</b>

494
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:31,889
<b>I need you out there."</b>

495
00:46:32,514 --> 00:46:33,682
<b>That's right.</b>

496
00:46:34,224 --> 00:46:37,186
<b>I need you for many tasks to come.</b>

497
00:46:47,237 --> 00:46:50,157
<b>Guys, why do you all seem depressed?</b>

498
00:46:53,035 --> 00:46:54,203
<b>Here.</b>

499
00:46:55,454 --> 00:46:56,997
<b>Where do you get all these?</b>

500
00:46:57,456 --> 00:46:59,041
<b>Tell me if these aren't enough.</b>

501
00:46:59,124 --> 00:47:01,460
<b>I have them stashed all over the place.</b>

502
00:47:01,585 --> 00:47:04,421
<b>Tae-woong, there's one in the back too.</b>

503
00:47:06,298 --> 00:47:09,760
<b>It's a moment like this where
I wonder about your past.</b>

504
00:47:10,761 --> 00:47:13,680
<b>Rich, fancy, and super stylish.</b>

505
00:47:14,264 --> 00:47:16,266
<b>That's who I was.</b>

506
00:47:16,350 --> 00:47:19,061
<b>Does the rich keep
stashes of snacks around?</b>

507
00:47:19,353 --> 00:47:21,855
<b>This is what you call being well-prepared.</b>

508
00:47:24,149 --> 00:47:25,609
<b>Jeez.</b>

509
00:47:26,652 --> 00:47:29,029
<b>I don't appreciate
being mocked for my generosity,</b>

510
00:47:29,112 --> 00:47:31,198
<b>but I'll let it slide
since I'm the mama bird.</b>

511
00:47:32,616 --> 00:47:35,160
<b>All right. Let's drink then.</b>

512
00:47:35,244 --> 00:47:36,495
<b>Thanks.</b>

513
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:51,009
<b>Mi-na astonishes me
every time I think about her.</b>

514
00:47:51,093 --> 00:47:53,428
<b>-This is out of the blue.
-When she was kidnapped,</b>

515
00:47:53,512 --> 00:47:54,763
<b>she took on nine men.</b>

516
00:47:55,556 --> 00:47:58,475
<b>That's right.
And they weren't some hillbillies.</b>

517
00:47:59,101 --> 00:48:01,937
<b>She doesn't have
any mechanical improvements like us</b>

518
00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:04,189
<b>which means she didn't have extra help.</b>

519
00:48:04,273 --> 00:48:05,816
<b>She's not scared of anything, is she?</b>

520
00:48:06,275 --> 00:48:07,609
<b>Has she always been this way?</b>

521
00:48:07,693 --> 00:48:09,653
<b>She used to be even more reckless.</b>

522
00:48:09,736 --> 00:48:13,031
<b>Anyway, she's the strongest woman I know.</b>

523
00:48:13,615 --> 00:48:14,700
<b>I know I can rely on her.</b>

524
00:48:15,033 --> 00:48:16,326
<b>She's a shoulder I can lean on.</b>

525
00:48:27,379 --> 00:48:29,631
<b>No one can be strong all the time.</b>

526
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:34,803
<b>Anyway, we still don't know
where they took Dr. Oh,</b>

527
00:48:34,887 --> 00:48:35,971
<b>so let's not lose our focus.</b>

528
00:48:36,054 --> 00:48:37,681
<b>-Got it.
-Sure.</b>

529
00:48:43,270 --> 00:48:47,190
<b>Welcome to hell, Kang Gi-beom!</b>

530
00:49:03,413 --> 00:49:05,248
<b><i>Tae-woong, you were right.</i></b>

531
00:49:06,249 --> 00:49:07,918
<b><i>I shouldn't have let him live.</i></b>

532
00:49:18,178 --> 00:49:20,180
<b><i>Talk about perfect timing.</i></b>

533
00:49:29,815 --> 00:49:32,567
<b>Let's not let those bastards
spread depression upon us.</b>

534
00:49:33,443 --> 00:49:36,113
<b>We'll pay them back with interest.</b>

535
00:50:01,388 --> 00:50:02,389
<b>You know,</b>

536
00:50:03,598 --> 00:50:06,685
<b>didn't it feel like they were
controlled out of there in a hurry?</b>

537
00:50:26,288 --> 00:50:30,208
<b>The enhanced soldiers
probably went back to the lab.</b>

538
00:50:31,668 --> 00:50:33,253
<b>What more can they be up to?</b>

539
00:50:33,336 --> 00:50:35,088
<b>Now that they can use Dr. Oh,</b>

540
00:50:35,672 --> 00:50:38,091
<b>the damage they can do
will be even larger.</b>

541
00:50:38,967 --> 00:50:41,511
<b>We must blow up Hwang Deuk-gu's lab first.</b>

542
00:50:42,804 --> 00:50:44,598
<b>If you're going to go in there,</b>

543
00:50:45,140 --> 00:50:46,141
<b>count me in too.</b>

544
00:50:47,517 --> 00:50:48,769
<b>Sure thing.</b>

545
00:50:56,109 --> 00:50:57,152
<b>Where did she go?</b>

546
00:51:00,405 --> 00:51:01,239
<b>Hey, Mi-na.</b>

547
00:51:04,284 --> 00:51:05,327
<b>What's this?</b>

548
00:51:07,662 --> 00:51:08,789
<b>Had some beer, did you?</b>

549
00:51:09,623 --> 00:51:12,250
<b>Yes, with the guys yesterday.
How did you know?</b>

550
00:51:12,959 --> 00:51:15,253
<b>Because I know you inside out.</b>

551
00:51:16,254 --> 00:51:17,422
<b>Wait, with the guys?</b>

552
00:51:18,673 --> 00:51:21,718
<b>So you guys are having fun without me?</b>

553
00:51:22,302 --> 00:51:24,429
<b>Alcohol is bad for your recovery,</b>

554
00:51:24,513 --> 00:51:25,514
<b>so don't be too upset.</b>

555
00:51:25,597 --> 00:51:27,140
<b>Still, I thought my pretty face</b>

556
00:51:27,808 --> 00:51:29,351
<b>would help you get better.</b>

557
00:51:29,893 --> 00:51:31,228
<b>Cover it. You're only annoying me.</b>

558
00:51:31,770 --> 00:51:32,938
<b>Jeez.</b>

559
00:51:34,898 --> 00:51:36,274
<b>Actually, I'm all better now.</b>

560
00:51:36,358 --> 00:51:37,901
<b>Not according to Susan.</b>

561
00:51:38,485 --> 00:51:40,028
<b>I know myself better than she does.</b>

562
00:51:40,111 --> 00:51:44,199
<b>Like always,
you have everything under control.</b>

563
00:51:44,908 --> 00:51:47,327
<b>No wonder the guys trusted you.</b>

564
00:51:47,661 --> 00:51:48,995
<b>Trusted me with what?</b>

565
00:51:49,955 --> 00:51:52,457
<b>Even when you were kidnapped
and in danger,</b>

566
00:51:52,541 --> 00:51:55,669
<b>we were able to calmly plan our next move.</b>

567
00:51:55,752 --> 00:51:58,463
<b>Because they trusted
that you'd find a way to stay alive.</b>

568
00:51:58,547 --> 00:52:00,173
<b>What do you mean by that?</b>

569
00:52:04,678 --> 00:52:05,762
<b>Tae-woong!</b>

570
00:52:05,846 --> 00:52:07,138
<b>Take it. Gi-beom's on the line.</b>

571
00:52:07,222 --> 00:52:08,932
<b>Why didn't he call HQ?</b>

572
00:52:09,015 --> 00:52:12,185
<b>Well, it's a long story,</b>

573
00:52:12,269 --> 00:52:14,855
<b>but his eyes stopped streaming live
after blacking out.</b>

574
00:52:14,938 --> 00:52:16,982
<b>Things seem urgent.</b>

575
00:52:17,065 --> 00:52:18,733
<b>Gi-beom, did you blackout?</b>

576
00:52:18,817 --> 00:52:20,569
<b>Why? What's going on? Are you okay?</b>

577
00:52:20,652 --> 00:52:22,028
<b>Keep it down, will you?</b>

578
00:52:22,112 --> 00:52:23,738
<b>We need to be careful about this.</b>

579
00:52:23,822 --> 00:52:25,949
<b>-Chief Choi can't know.
-Speak, Gi-beom.</b>

580
00:52:26,032 --> 00:52:28,285
<b>I'm close to where Mi-na was taken.</b>

581
00:52:28,827 --> 00:52:31,496
<b>Once I get there,
I'll be handing over this phone.</b>

582
00:52:31,580 --> 00:52:34,207
<b>You'll give up
your connection to Choi Ye-won?</b>

583
00:52:35,292 --> 00:52:38,378
<b>We'll have to offer a decent deal
to get what we want.</b>

584
00:52:38,461 --> 00:52:41,047
<b>Won't you end up in danger too?</b>

585
00:52:41,131 --> 00:52:42,883
<b>You'll have to come before that happens.</b>

586
00:52:42,966 --> 00:52:44,634
<b>I can't fight them all by myself.</b>

587
00:52:45,385 --> 00:52:46,261
<b>Got it.</b>

588
00:52:47,679 --> 00:52:50,307
<b>This is a chance
to get close to Hwang Deuk-gu.</b>

589
00:52:50,682 --> 00:52:53,310
<b>It seems like a worthy gamble.
What do you say, Tae-woong?</b>

590
00:52:54,352 --> 00:52:57,147
<b>Wherever you are, we'll close in on you.</b>

591
00:52:57,898 --> 00:52:59,733
<b>Gi-beom, just stay alive.</b>

592
00:53:00,567 --> 00:53:01,902
<b>Sure, I'll see you soon.</b>

593
00:53:14,623 --> 00:53:17,918
<b>So you used me being kidnapped</b>

594
00:53:18,001 --> 00:53:19,753
<b>to make a strategic move?</b>

595
00:53:21,254 --> 00:53:23,298
<b>It was an awesome one as well,</b>

596
00:53:23,381 --> 00:53:26,051
<b>but the bastards went the other way.</b>

597
00:53:26,134 --> 00:53:27,886
<b>We succeeded halfway.</b>

598
00:53:27,969 --> 00:53:29,262
<b>For whatever reason,</b>

599
00:53:29,346 --> 00:53:33,350
<b>we found out that Choi Ye-won
could be Hwang Deuk-gu's weakness.</b>

600
00:53:34,476 --> 00:53:37,187
<b>I doubt this is the time
to share our thoughts,</b>

601
00:53:37,270 --> 00:53:40,106
<b>but I'm glad that I could be of help.</b>

602
00:53:40,190 --> 00:53:42,525
<b>Next time, I'll come up
with a more meticulous plan.</b>

603
00:53:43,109 --> 00:53:45,987
<b>I'd definitely appreciate
an upgrade in the escape plan.</b>

<b>Of course.</b>

605
00:53:48,615 --> 00:53:50,241
<b>Mi-na, first think about fully recovering.</b>

606
00:53:51,868 --> 00:53:52,869
<b>Got it.</b>
