HOSPITAL PLAYLIST

2
00:00:07,555 --> 00:00:08,639
Buy me dinner, please.

3
00:00:13,644 --> 00:00:16,647
Buy me dinner this weekend, Professor Ahn.

4
00:00:19,275 --> 00:00:21,652
Sure. Let's have a get-together
with everyone.

5
00:00:21,735 --> 00:00:23,028
Just the two of us.

6
00:00:26,907 --> 00:00:28,659
Just the two of us, outside the hospital

7
00:00:28,742 --> 00:00:30,744
and not in these scrubs,
but in our personal clothes.

8
00:00:42,965 --> 00:00:44,216
I have plans.

9
00:00:46,051 --> 00:00:48,137
I need to visit my mother in Yangpyeong.

10
00:00:49,972 --> 00:00:50,806
I'm sorry.

11
00:01:14,016 --> 00:01:16,586
HOSPITAL PLAYLIST

12
00:01:16,665 --> 00:01:18,125
-That's awful.
-Hold on.

13
00:01:19,001 --> 00:01:20,377
Let me get this straight.

14
00:01:21,003 --> 00:01:22,421
The real estate agent told the owner

15
00:01:22,922 --> 00:01:24,882
that he signed a contract
to pay monthly rent.

16
00:01:25,007 --> 00:01:26,800
But Dr. Do signed
a deposit-based apartment.

17
00:01:27,635 --> 00:01:30,346
The agent gave the owner 20 million won
and the first month's rent

18
00:01:30,429 --> 00:01:32,014
and took the rest of Dr. Do's deposit.

19
00:01:32,097 --> 00:01:35,559
Yes, that's what happened. Jeez.

20
00:01:37,937 --> 00:01:39,021
What's he going to do now?

21
00:01:39,104 --> 00:01:41,440
He spent his whole life
saving up that money.

22
00:01:42,483 --> 00:01:44,235
He took out
a 100-million-won mortgage too.

23
00:01:45,402 --> 00:01:48,030
He lost all of his money
and has to pay back the interest, too.

24
00:01:48,113 --> 00:01:50,491
-Did the police catch the agent?
-The agent already bolted.

25
00:01:51,492 --> 00:01:53,244
He reported it to the police,

26
00:01:53,994 --> 00:01:55,037
but they told him
not to keep his hopes up.

27
00:01:55,621 --> 00:01:57,122
Where are they going to live now?

28
00:01:57,957 --> 00:02:00,042
They can live there and pay rent.

29
00:02:00,626 --> 00:02:01,919
The contract is nullified anyway.

30
00:02:02,294 --> 00:02:04,505
The house owner
just wants him to pay rent.

31
00:02:04,588 --> 00:02:05,965
Can't they just stay there?

32
00:02:06,048 --> 00:02:09,009
Seon-bin, I guess paying 900,000 won
every month must come easy to you.

33
00:02:10,052 --> 00:02:11,387
No. I'm sorry.

34
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,180
Don't. You don't have to apologize.

35
00:02:14,431 --> 00:02:17,226
There's nothing wrong
with having rich parents.

36
00:02:17,309 --> 00:02:20,854
Paying 900,000 won every month
is too much. He has to move.

37
00:02:20,938 --> 00:02:23,524
As a matter of fact, they'll stay there
by the end of this week.

38
00:02:24,233 --> 00:02:26,193
His wife will go
to her parents' house in Paju.

39
00:02:26,277 --> 00:02:29,280
And Dr. Do will be staying
at a cheap studio for the time being.

40
00:02:30,739 --> 00:02:33,450
I'm not sure if he'll be able to focus
after all that has happened.

41
00:02:34,827 --> 00:02:37,162
He's probably out of it right now.

42
00:02:38,247 --> 00:02:40,541
I'm really not interested in it.
I won't do it.

43
00:02:40,666 --> 00:02:43,669
Have you ever seen me take
a managerial position? I'll never do it.

44
00:02:43,752 --> 00:02:45,838
Do you want to leave
the CS department without a chief?

45
00:02:45,921 --> 00:02:47,840
I'm sure a few professors
would want the position.

46
00:02:47,923 --> 00:02:50,759
Tell Professor Cheon to do it.
He'll have an easier time getting rebates.

47
00:02:50,843 --> 00:02:52,720
The chairman said
he could never be the chief.

48
00:02:52,803 --> 00:02:55,472
He won't let Professor Cheon take over
except for the CS Department.

49
00:02:55,556 --> 00:02:57,182
He thinks he will cause trouble again.

50
00:02:57,266 --> 00:02:58,726
If he is bound to cause trouble,

51
00:02:58,809 --> 00:03:01,145
he should be investigated
and punished accordingly.

52
00:03:01,228 --> 00:03:02,938
Why would he stop midway through?

53
00:03:03,022 --> 00:03:05,524
-Exactly. You should take the position.
-Exactly.

54
00:03:05,607 --> 00:03:06,817
I'm sorry.

55
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,992
Did you tell the perfusionist
that the patient has a left SVC?

56
00:03:16,493 --> 00:03:19,747
Right. I'm sorry. I forgot to check on it.

57
00:03:20,706 --> 00:03:22,374
You didn't confirm it
with the perfusionist?

58
00:03:23,792 --> 00:03:24,668
I'm sorry.

59
00:03:27,755 --> 00:03:29,340
Did you even look at the ultrasound?

60
00:03:31,383 --> 00:03:33,427
What are you doing? Get a grip.

61
00:03:34,595 --> 00:03:36,055
I'm sorry.

62
00:03:36,138 --> 00:03:37,348
Do you want the kid to die?

63
00:03:37,765 --> 00:03:39,767
Don't bring your personal life
into the OR.

64
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,185
If you can't do that, leave.

65
00:03:42,936 --> 00:03:44,313
No, I'm sorry.

66
00:03:46,732 --> 00:03:49,610
I'll insert the vent catheter
in the coronary sinus.

67
00:03:50,903 --> 00:03:52,363
Were you able to reach Eun-won?

68
00:03:52,571 --> 00:03:55,366
No. She was having a hard time
when she was on the night shift recently.

69
00:03:55,449 --> 00:03:58,827
The death of the patient, Yun Mi-seong,
must have hit her hard.

70
00:03:59,328 --> 00:04:02,039
She was already physically tired,
but she lost a patient.

71
00:04:02,539 --> 00:04:04,041
I think that case triggered it.

72
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:07,669
Of course, it's hard. There is
so much work, but we're short-staffed.

73
00:04:08,295 --> 00:04:10,339
-And she was sleep-deprived, too.
-What happened?

74
00:04:10,422 --> 00:04:12,716
Dr. Myeong Eun-won has been
MIA since yesterday morning,

75
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,884
no word for two days.

76
00:04:14,968 --> 00:04:16,512
What if she never comes back?

77
00:04:18,389 --> 00:04:20,265
-Hello.
-Hello.

78
00:04:20,849 --> 00:04:21,892
Hi.

79
00:04:22,601 --> 00:04:23,977
-Dr. Chu.
-Yes?

80
00:04:24,061 --> 00:04:26,397
If you hear from Eun-won,
please let me know right away.

81
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,856
Okay. I will.

82
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:29,983
-Hello.
-Hi.

83
00:04:34,655 --> 00:04:36,115
Let's look at the CT scan.

84
00:04:37,783 --> 00:04:41,620
This is the right side of your liver.

85
00:04:41,954 --> 00:04:44,039
Can you see this mass,
about two centimeters,

86
00:04:44,123 --> 00:04:45,666
deep on the right side?

87
00:04:47,751 --> 00:04:50,295
You have cirrhosis of the liver, too.

88
00:04:50,379 --> 00:04:52,714
From your blood results,
your CEA level is high.

89
00:04:52,798 --> 00:04:54,007
I think...

90
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:58,095
I do think it's liver cancer.

91
00:04:59,555 --> 00:05:00,764
Oh, no.

92
00:05:06,353 --> 00:05:08,188
It's only two centimeters.
We caught it early.

93
00:05:08,272 --> 00:05:09,857
But for liver cancer,

94
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:12,651
checking if it's operable or not
is the most important, not the size.

95
00:05:12,734 --> 00:05:15,028
First, we should take an MRI
in order to confirm

96
00:05:15,112 --> 00:05:17,197
my diagnosis
that it is indeed liver cancer.

97
00:05:17,281 --> 00:05:19,992
We also need to check
if the cancer has spread to other parts.

98
00:05:20,576 --> 00:05:22,828
Surgeries are the best treatment plan
for liver cancer.

99
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:24,830
If the cancer has metastasized,

100
00:05:25,581 --> 00:05:27,791
we may have to change
our course of treatment.

101
00:05:29,751 --> 00:05:30,961
Doctor,

102
00:05:33,255 --> 00:05:35,090
will I be able to live?

103
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,677
Of course. You have to live.

104
00:05:41,597 --> 00:05:43,390
I am not sure

105
00:05:44,266 --> 00:05:45,893
if this will comfort you in any way.

106
00:05:46,768 --> 00:05:50,272
If this is operable, it will mean
a huge chance of your survival.

107
00:05:50,355 --> 00:05:51,815
Please don't think it's the end.

108
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:55,611
Let's be optimistic about it
and wait for the test result.

109
00:05:56,195 --> 00:05:58,739
Doctor, when can he get the surgery?

110
00:05:59,823 --> 00:06:01,658
We want it done as soon as possible.

111
00:06:01,742 --> 00:06:02,910
Let's get you admitted today.

112
00:06:02,993 --> 00:06:05,787
Let's get you admitted and run tests
that will confirm my diagnosis.

113
00:06:05,871 --> 00:06:08,790
And if it is cancer,
let's check if it spread, too.

114
00:06:10,918 --> 00:06:11,793
Okay.

115
00:06:11,877 --> 00:06:16,673
And one of my surgeries
got canceled the following Tuesday.

116
00:06:17,799 --> 00:06:19,343
If the tests confirm that it's operable,

117
00:06:19,426 --> 00:06:21,094
let's get your surgery on that day, then.

118
00:06:22,179 --> 00:06:24,848
However, if the tests show that the cancer

119
00:06:25,724 --> 00:06:27,935
has spread or is abnormal,

120
00:06:28,435 --> 00:06:30,145
the surgery date can be changed.

121
00:06:31,146 --> 00:06:33,023
Once you go out, the nurse will explain

122
00:06:33,106 --> 00:06:35,234
the steps of getting admitted
to the hospital.

123
00:06:39,988 --> 00:06:43,075
You need to stay strong
for your father to stay strong, too.

124
00:06:44,576 --> 00:06:45,452
Okay.

125
00:06:46,787 --> 00:06:47,871
Thank you.

126
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:01,218
Professor Ahn,
do you have a headache again?

127
00:07:02,052 --> 00:07:04,596
-Do you want some medicine?
-No, I'm good.

128
00:07:05,097 --> 00:07:07,474
-Did you take her abdominal X-ray today?
-Yes.

129
00:07:08,267 --> 00:07:10,352
How much drainage did she get
yesterday from the tube?

130
00:07:11,019 --> 00:07:12,604
It was 50 two days ago. It's 20 today.

131
00:07:12,688 --> 00:07:13,897
It went down a lot.

132
00:07:13,981 --> 00:07:15,315
Is that so?

133
00:07:15,899 --> 00:07:16,733
Let's see.

134
00:07:19,736 --> 00:07:20,696
My gosh.

135
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,907
It was really green yesterday.
It's transparent today.

136
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:35,961
You should visit a doctor.
Do you want me to give you a referral?

137
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:38,255
I'll take care of it myself.

138
00:07:38,714 --> 00:07:40,257
You should introduce <i>Bidulgi</i> to me.

139
00:07:40,924 --> 00:07:43,677
She's very busy right now.
I'll introduce you to her later.

140
00:07:46,013 --> 00:07:47,306
So she is your girlfriend, right?

141
00:07:48,348 --> 00:07:50,517
I'll tell you everything another time.

142
00:07:54,688 --> 00:07:56,023
What's taking Jeong-won so long?

143
00:07:56,398 --> 00:07:57,774
He'll get nothing if he comes late.

144
00:08:00,485 --> 00:08:01,320
There he is.

145
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:04,294
What's taking Jeong-won so long?

146
00:08:04,669 --> 00:08:06,046
He'll get nothing if he comes late.

147
00:08:08,757 --> 00:08:09,591
There he is.

148
00:08:11,301 --> 00:08:14,387
Seeing how he's happy,
his patient must be doing well.

149
00:08:14,471 --> 00:08:16,640
-Or his patient is about to be discharged.
-Hey.

150
00:08:17,349 --> 00:08:18,934
Jae-i is pooping really well.

151
00:08:19,935 --> 00:08:21,311
Is that so? Congrats.

152
00:08:22,103 --> 00:08:24,606
The color is beautiful,
and the shape is great, too.

153
00:08:27,067 --> 00:08:29,110
She poops right away
whenever she eats now.

154
00:08:30,278 --> 00:08:31,613
Her poo is so beautiful!

155
00:08:32,489 --> 00:08:34,324
What about my bread? Where's mine?

156
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:38,703
We finished all of it.

157
00:08:40,956 --> 00:08:42,374
It's turning into poo now.

158
00:08:46,419 --> 00:08:47,337
Yes.

159
00:08:48,797 --> 00:08:49,923
I'm on my way now. Bye.

160
00:08:54,469 --> 00:08:55,637
Hey, it's right there.

161
00:08:59,015 --> 00:09:00,976
There are valves in everyone's heart.

162
00:09:01,434 --> 00:09:03,645
The blood flows in one direction.

163
00:09:03,728 --> 00:09:05,814
The valves make sure the blood
doesn't flow backward

164
00:09:05,897 --> 00:09:06,898
once it passes through.

165
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:11,194
Usually, one or two valves may leak
or shrink when babies are born.

166
00:09:11,278 --> 00:09:13,029
We often have to perform surgery for it.

167
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:17,117
But your baby is a very rare case.

168
00:09:17,993 --> 00:09:20,453
All of the valves in his heart
are leaking.

169
00:09:20,996 --> 00:09:23,873
We didn't find anything unusual
from the genetic testing.

170
00:09:24,165 --> 00:09:27,460
I cannot diagnose your baby
with a known name of the disease.

171
00:09:29,296 --> 00:09:30,171
For now,

172
00:09:30,714 --> 00:09:33,758
Hun's heart can't pump blood out of his
heart. The blood keeps flowing backward.

173
00:09:34,759 --> 00:09:36,845
The aortic valve regurgitation
is severe with his case,

174
00:09:36,928 --> 00:09:38,847
so I cannot put him on ECMO, either.

175
00:09:39,639 --> 00:09:41,516
And when he was transferred
to our hospital,

176
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,020
he had brain damage due to either CPR

177
00:09:45,604 --> 00:09:46,896
or genetic defect.

178
00:09:47,397 --> 00:09:50,609
We must induce him with a high dosage
of diuretic to produce a bit of urine

179
00:09:50,692 --> 00:09:52,527
since cardiac output has
drastically decreased.

180
00:09:53,111 --> 00:09:54,654
He has a severe case of pulmonary edema,

181
00:09:54,738 --> 00:09:56,781
so we can't treat him
with more medication.

182
00:09:56,865 --> 00:09:57,949
What about surgery?

183
00:09:59,034 --> 00:10:00,327
Doctor, if he gets surgery,

184
00:10:03,246 --> 00:10:04,372
wouldn't he be able to live?

185
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,916
The survival rate is about 50 percent.

186
00:10:15,675 --> 00:10:17,969
We perform heart surgery
to improve patients' health.

187
00:10:18,053 --> 00:10:19,387
As for your baby...

188
00:10:20,472 --> 00:10:23,266
But then, again,
surgery is the only option we have.

189
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:26,603
It's hard for me to tell you
what will happen during surgery.

190
00:10:27,354 --> 00:10:29,689
But we can't let him go
without fighting for him.

191
00:10:30,398 --> 00:10:32,275
I can't guarantee that I can fix him,

192
00:10:34,611 --> 00:10:35,654
but there's no other way.

193
00:10:39,366 --> 00:10:40,742
We should give it a try.

194
00:10:41,576 --> 00:10:42,619
Okay.

195
00:10:44,496 --> 00:10:45,372
All right, then.

196
00:11:04,349 --> 00:11:07,894
You should lean on your back
and tuck your chin in

197
00:11:07,977 --> 00:11:09,062
to avoid herniated discs.

198
00:11:10,897 --> 00:11:11,940
Okay.

199
00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:14,651
Having a sedentary job must be tough.

200
00:11:15,485 --> 00:11:16,319
It's all done.

201
00:11:17,278 --> 00:11:20,407
You're the one with a hard job.
You always go home late.

202
00:11:21,241 --> 00:11:22,492
How did you know that?

203
00:11:23,243 --> 00:11:24,953
You always look so tired.

204
00:11:26,621 --> 00:11:27,497
I see.

205
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:28,748
MOM'S 70TH BIRTHDAY TRIP ACCOUNT

206
00:11:28,832 --> 00:11:30,583
Will you make another savings account?

207
00:11:30,667 --> 00:11:34,462
You're a long-term customer at our bank,
so you'll get a good interest rate.

208
00:11:35,171 --> 00:11:37,465
I wanted to start a new installment
savings account for 100,000 won.

209
00:11:37,549 --> 00:11:39,718
But I have to get going today.

210
00:11:40,385 --> 00:11:42,220
-Have a good day.
-Bye.

211
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:48,476
By the way, I heard

212
00:11:49,227 --> 00:11:51,771
that your bank gives out dolls
when the installment savings matures.

213
00:11:53,606 --> 00:11:54,649
Wait, please.

214
00:12:00,739 --> 00:12:02,615
Mom, Song-hwa asked
if this is good enough.

215
00:12:02,699 --> 00:12:03,742
That's perfect.

216
00:12:06,536 --> 00:12:08,371
My gosh, that looks beautiful.

217
00:12:09,205 --> 00:12:12,459
Song-hwa is beautiful and smart,

218
00:12:12,542 --> 00:12:13,835
and has wits like this.

219
00:12:13,918 --> 00:12:15,754
-Why--
-Why isn't she married?

220
00:12:15,837 --> 00:12:17,839
No. Why

221
00:12:18,631 --> 00:12:20,300
doesn't she like my son?

222
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:23,887
If you marry a girl like Song-hwa,

223
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:26,931
I could join the Lord even tomorrow
and have nothing to wish for.

224
00:12:27,515 --> 00:12:28,683
Come on.

225
00:12:28,767 --> 00:12:31,019
My son is sensitive and delicate.

226
00:12:31,728 --> 00:12:33,438
You're beautiful like flowers.

227
00:12:35,023 --> 00:12:36,983
And you also easily get hurt like flowers.

228
00:12:37,817 --> 00:12:40,570
It'd be nice if you have
a reliable life partner like Song-hwa.

229
00:12:40,653 --> 00:12:43,490
Mom, you're turning 70 soon.
I'll send you on a trip.

230
00:12:43,573 --> 00:12:44,991
Tell me anywhere you want to go.

231
00:12:45,074 --> 00:12:47,952
I must book it now to get tickets.
And we'll have a birthday party, too.

232
00:12:48,536 --> 00:12:50,121
I'll make sure you're not lonely,
even without Dad here with us.

233
00:12:50,205 --> 00:12:52,373
Your youngest son will throw you
the biggest birthday party ever.

234
00:12:52,457 --> 00:12:55,376
Forget it. I don't want a party.
No more throwing parties, okay?

235
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,588
I'll go somewhere close like
Southeast Asia with Song-hwa.

236
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:02,217
Or should we go to Jeju Island?

237
00:13:02,967 --> 00:13:04,594
The four of us can go together.

238
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:08,431
-Why are there four of us?
-I must take Jong-su with me.

239
00:13:09,599 --> 00:13:11,184
He's a lonely man.

240
00:13:11,267 --> 00:13:13,436
What's the point of having
successful and rich children?

241
00:13:13,561 --> 00:13:16,689
He has colorful bruises all over his body,
from his forehead to knees,

242
00:13:16,773 --> 00:13:18,483
because he slipped in the bathroom.

243
00:13:22,028 --> 00:13:23,696
I haven't had it for a while. It's good.

244
00:13:25,031 --> 00:13:26,741
Stop lying.

245
00:13:27,534 --> 00:13:29,118
You always eat <i>ramyeon</i> at home.

246
00:13:29,911 --> 00:13:31,412
I haven't had cup noodles for a while.

247
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:35,083
Your kids must've been scared.

248
00:13:36,251 --> 00:13:37,293
What did Geon-tae say?

249
00:13:38,086 --> 00:13:39,003
You called him, right?

250
00:13:39,629 --> 00:13:40,713
No, I didn't.

251
00:13:41,047 --> 00:13:43,049
He must be busy at his new hospital.
Why bother him?

252
00:13:43,675 --> 00:13:46,761
What about Tae-ung?
You should at least tell Tae-ung.

253
00:13:46,845 --> 00:13:49,597
He's working on a big lawsuit these days.
He's working all night.

254
00:13:49,681 --> 00:13:50,557
They are both busy.

255
00:13:51,558 --> 00:13:54,602
It's a hassle when the kids come, too.
I'm better off alone.

256
00:14:00,233 --> 00:14:01,693
Hey, Rosa.

257
00:14:02,819 --> 00:14:03,653
Me?

258
00:14:04,195 --> 00:14:05,238
I'm in Mr. Kettle's office.

259
00:14:06,906 --> 00:14:09,284
Okay. See you at the cafe in ten minutes.

260
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,245
Not the one in the lobby.

261
00:14:13,329 --> 00:14:15,248
There's a new cafe
in front of the hospital.

262
00:14:15,331 --> 00:14:16,541
They serve delicious drinks.

263
00:14:18,042 --> 00:14:19,794
Yes. That's the one.

264
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:21,713
When have you been there?

265
00:14:23,089 --> 00:14:24,340
Good for you.

266
00:14:25,091 --> 00:14:27,468
You go on dates to the cafes
with your son.

267
00:14:28,261 --> 00:14:29,137
Okay.

268
00:14:33,308 --> 00:14:34,183
By the way,

269
00:14:35,643 --> 00:14:37,395
did you appoint a new chief?

270
00:14:37,478 --> 00:14:39,647
No. No one wants to take the job.

271
00:14:42,191 --> 00:14:44,652
Golfing is more fun for old professors.

272
00:14:44,736 --> 00:14:48,197
Young professors prefer
going home early even for a day

273
00:14:48,281 --> 00:14:50,617
instead of getting 300,000 won
for the managerial position.

274
00:14:51,117 --> 00:14:55,163
No one wants to be the chief
because they'll end up working more.

275
00:14:56,873 --> 00:15:00,126
Besides, we don't have
that many professors for NS and CS.

276
00:15:00,209 --> 00:15:01,878
So it's harder to fill in the position.

277
00:15:02,378 --> 00:15:06,633
What about Professor Min Gi-jun of NS?
He's in charge of the Neuroscience Center.

278
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:10,053
He's in charge of the center,
appears on TV, and YouTube.

279
00:15:11,054 --> 00:15:12,347
He's busy.

280
00:15:13,181 --> 00:15:15,892
Make a young professor
take the position for CS.

281
00:15:15,975 --> 00:15:17,477
Just order someone to do it.

282
00:15:18,811 --> 00:15:21,397
Jong-su, why don't you retire?

283
00:15:22,565 --> 00:15:24,317
Do you think they listen to the director?

284
00:15:25,068 --> 00:15:27,111
They all know exactly what they want
for themselves.

285
00:15:27,862 --> 00:15:30,073
As a matter of fact, I'm going to retire.

286
00:15:33,326 --> 00:15:34,160
Really?

287
00:15:34,243 --> 00:15:36,955
I'll retire after running the hospital
for three more years.

288
00:15:37,038 --> 00:15:37,956
Jeez.

289
00:15:39,207 --> 00:15:40,959
Mom, I have surgery. I've got to go.

290
00:15:41,042 --> 00:15:43,294
-Get something delicious with Mr. Ju.
-Okay. Go on.

291
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,799
CHIEF PRIEST

292
00:15:49,717 --> 00:15:52,095
Father, how have you been?

293
00:15:52,512 --> 00:15:54,055
Jeong-won left his phone here.

294
00:15:54,138 --> 00:15:57,976
<i>I see.
Please relay this message to Andrea.</i>

295
00:15:59,727 --> 00:16:00,812
Go on.

296
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:05,650
<i>They accepted their recommendation letter.</i>

297
00:16:05,733 --> 00:16:06,943
<i>Congratulate him for me.</i>

298
00:16:08,111 --> 00:16:09,612
They accepted

299
00:16:11,948 --> 00:16:13,533
-the recommendation letter?
<i>-Yes.</i>

300
00:16:13,616 --> 00:16:15,576
<i>I just received the email.</i>

301
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:18,121
<i>The parish in Naples received
the recommendation letter.</i>

302
00:16:18,204 --> 00:16:21,541
<i>They are willing to accept him,
so they'd like to see him in person.</i>

303
00:16:22,917 --> 00:16:25,628
<i>I told them I would talk to Andrea
when he could be available</i>

304
00:16:25,712 --> 00:16:28,631
<i>for the interview
and call them right back.</i>

305
00:16:28,715 --> 00:16:30,174
I'm sorry, Father.

306
00:16:30,925 --> 00:16:32,593
Jeong-won can't make it to the interview.

307
00:16:33,511 --> 00:16:36,139
<i>-Pardon?</i>
-I'm sorry. I'm hanging up.

308
00:16:36,222 --> 00:16:37,640
My apologies, Father.

309
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:43,730
Where did I put my phone?

310
00:16:45,231 --> 00:16:46,315
Jeong-won.

311
00:16:47,442 --> 00:16:48,484
Yes?

312
00:16:49,986 --> 00:16:51,779
The chief priest just called.

313
00:16:53,865 --> 00:16:55,575
They accepted your recommendation letter.

314
00:16:58,119 --> 00:16:59,954
I don't need a fancy 70th birthday party.

315
00:17:00,038 --> 00:17:02,290
I won't be sad
even if you don't throw me a party.

316
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,210
You don't have to do that.
Just stay by my side.

317
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:09,672
We don't have to live together
or call each other.

318
00:17:10,173 --> 00:17:11,591
Just stay by my side.

319
00:17:12,341 --> 00:17:13,259
Please.

320
00:17:18,431 --> 00:17:19,557
Live a normal life.

321
00:17:22,769 --> 00:17:24,187
That's my last wish.

322
00:17:40,244 --> 00:17:42,789
This won't do it.

323
00:17:43,122 --> 00:17:45,750
Stop talking back to me,
and give me some painkillers.

324
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:48,628
I notified the doctor,
but I didn't get the order yet.

325
00:17:48,711 --> 00:17:49,754
Please wait.

326
00:17:50,338 --> 00:17:51,923
Mr. Lee Jeong-bae,
I'll take your blood pressure.

327
00:17:52,006 --> 00:17:54,342
The doctor will be here.
I'll dress your wound.

328
00:17:54,425 --> 00:17:55,343
Okay.

329
00:17:55,551 --> 00:17:58,638
Then, are you telling me
that I have to be in pain like this?

330
00:17:59,138 --> 00:18:02,225
Does this hospital just let patients
suffer in pain? What is this place?

331
00:18:03,017 --> 00:18:03,976
Excuse me.

332
00:18:06,729 --> 00:18:08,606
-What's going on?
-I gave him his meds,

333
00:18:08,689 --> 00:18:10,817
-but he keeps asking for painkillers.
-Which one?

334
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,819
An hour ago,
I gave him an ampoule of Tridol.

335
00:18:12,902 --> 00:18:14,987
No, I don't want that one.

336
00:18:17,031 --> 00:18:19,075
What was that called? Pethidine?

337
00:18:19,742 --> 00:18:21,911
I want pethidine
or whatever that's called.

338
00:18:21,994 --> 00:18:22,995
PETHIDINE: A NARCOTIC PAINKILLER

339
00:18:23,079 --> 00:18:26,207
Sir, we cannot give you pethidine
unless a doctor prescribes it for you.

340
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:28,835
Why do you need a doctor
to give me a shot?

341
00:18:28,918 --> 00:18:31,420
Just give me a shot of pethidine
and leave me alone.

342
00:18:31,504 --> 00:18:32,839
I'm sorry.

343
00:18:33,089 --> 00:18:35,007
Can you get me some betadine balls?

344
00:18:35,091 --> 00:18:35,967
Okay.

345
00:18:36,217 --> 00:18:40,429
Come on. Why are you
being so uptight about a shot?

346
00:18:41,556 --> 00:18:43,558
Is giving me a shot that hard? Hey!

347
00:18:46,769 --> 00:18:49,230
A patient is in pain!

348
00:18:49,814 --> 00:18:51,899
I'm in serious pain right now.

349
00:19:00,908 --> 00:19:01,784
You're fine.

350
00:19:01,868 --> 00:19:04,287
The surgery went well.
And the wound is clean, too.

351
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:06,706
Keep an eye on him for a few hours
and get back to me.

352
00:19:07,665 --> 00:19:08,499
Okay.

353
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:11,043
All you guys do is cut people open.
You know nothing.

354
00:19:12,044 --> 00:19:14,463
I'm in pain. Okay?

355
00:19:15,756 --> 00:19:18,759
Give me pethidine. Just give it to me!

356
00:19:19,385 --> 00:19:20,887
Hurry!

357
00:19:22,096 --> 00:19:23,806
Are you addicted to narcotic painkillers?

358
00:19:27,602 --> 00:19:29,770
Are you addicted to narcotic painkillers?

359
00:19:33,482 --> 00:19:36,360
We already gave you a drip for the pain
and Tridol an hour ago.

360
00:19:36,444 --> 00:19:39,572
If we give you pethidine on top of this,
you might lose consciousness.

361
00:19:39,655 --> 00:19:41,657
So I can't prescribe it.
Do you still want it?

362
00:19:44,535 --> 00:19:45,786
Forget it. Damn it.

363
00:19:49,415 --> 00:19:52,543
I understand that you are upset.
But you can't just say--

364
00:19:52,627 --> 00:19:54,295
<i>She was fine
when she went to the hospital.</i>

365
00:19:54,545 --> 00:19:57,256
<i>You guys messed up.
That's why she's still stuck in bed!</i>

366
00:19:58,132 --> 00:20:00,134
Listen, sir. The patient,

367
00:20:00,635 --> 00:20:03,095
your wife, had pneumonia
even before the surgery,

368
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:05,097
so I explained to you she would need

369
00:20:05,181 --> 00:20:09,060
the ventilator for a long time and she may
stay in the ICU for a long duration.

370
00:20:09,143 --> 00:20:10,770
<i>It's okay as long as you explain it?</i>

371
00:20:11,354 --> 00:20:14,148
<i>You say you're her doctor,
but how much time did you spend on her?</i>

372
00:20:14,857 --> 00:20:18,527
<i>Is this how you'll treat your own mother
if she's lying in that bed?</i>

373
00:20:24,325 --> 00:20:26,619
Okay, sir. I'm sorry. Bye.

374
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:31,707
Who was that? A guardian?

375
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:36,545
My gosh. That was
the husband of my patient.

376
00:20:40,258 --> 00:20:43,344
She has pneumonia and is old, too.

377
00:20:43,844 --> 00:20:45,930
She's been on a ventilator
for some time after surgery.

378
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:49,517
I've had a lot of patients lately.

379
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,560
Yesterday was the only day
I couldn't check on her.

380
00:20:54,397 --> 00:20:56,190
I can't believe
he'd just attack me like this.

381
00:20:56,274 --> 00:21:00,236
Why did you choose CS?
There are a lot of other easy departments.

382
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,738
They said I'd get ten million won more.

383
00:21:04,699 --> 00:21:06,284
Not a lot of doctors applied to CS.

384
00:21:06,575 --> 00:21:09,328
They said I'd get ten million won more
on my annual salary if I applied.

385
00:21:10,496 --> 00:21:11,706
That's why I picked CS.

386
00:21:13,499 --> 00:21:16,043
What about you, Dr. Ahn? Why NS?

387
00:21:16,752 --> 00:21:19,463
You're not even well.
Why did you become a surgeon?

388
00:21:20,131 --> 00:21:21,215
I saw a documentary.

389
00:21:21,966 --> 00:21:24,510
Only neurosurgeons did surgery
while sitting down.

390
00:21:26,971 --> 00:21:29,140
There are more surgeries
we do on our feet.

391
00:21:29,432 --> 00:21:32,560
Professor Chae has
a cervical herniated disc.

392
00:21:32,643 --> 00:21:35,354
Exactly. I didn't know any better, then.

393
00:21:36,605 --> 00:21:38,149
What should I do? I'm doomed.

394
00:21:39,442 --> 00:21:40,568
Hello, who is this?

395
00:21:40,901 --> 00:21:43,821
<i>I'm the daughter of the man
that just called you.</i>

396
00:21:44,238 --> 00:21:47,283
<i>I was next to my father.
I'm sorry, doctor.</i>

397
00:21:47,366 --> 00:21:48,367
I see.

398
00:21:48,701 --> 00:21:51,287
<i>My father is having a tough time
because of my mom.</i>

399
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:54,790
<i>He can't control his emotions well.
I am very sorry.</i>

400
00:21:56,375 --> 00:21:57,209
I see.

401
00:22:00,004 --> 00:22:03,299
Your father was very rude on the phone.

402
00:22:04,925 --> 00:22:07,678
Well, I understand
that this is hard for him.

403
00:22:08,637 --> 00:22:10,264
But treating me like that...

404
00:22:28,657 --> 00:22:29,784
What's going on?

405
00:22:30,451 --> 00:22:32,411
Are you going to a wedding?
You're wearing contact lens.

406
00:22:32,495 --> 00:22:35,331
Yes, one of my school friends'.
But I'm not really close to her.

407
00:22:37,625 --> 00:22:38,918
If you're not close, why go?

408
00:22:39,001 --> 00:22:41,003
She came to my second
and third brothers' weddings.

409
00:22:41,087 --> 00:22:42,088
I should go to hers.

410
00:22:43,631 --> 00:22:46,092
You don't have to go
to everyone's wedding.

411
00:22:46,175 --> 00:22:47,593
What a weary life.

412
00:22:47,718 --> 00:22:49,261
Jeez.

413
00:22:49,845 --> 00:22:53,099
She must be loaded seeing that she's
getting married on a weekday afternoon.

414
00:22:54,225 --> 00:22:56,268
Jeong-won is buying dinner later.
You can't come?

415
00:22:56,352 --> 00:22:58,562
I should go. Father Ahn is buying.

416
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:02,733
I'll join you guys
straight from the wedding.

417
00:23:03,234 --> 00:23:04,318
Hey, the kettle is hot.

418
00:23:09,949 --> 00:23:11,033
It burns.

419
00:23:17,706 --> 00:23:19,625
How will you do surgery
with these fingers?

420
00:23:19,708 --> 00:23:22,420
My goodness. You should be more careful.

421
00:23:22,503 --> 00:23:24,713
-How old are you?
-Forty.

422
00:23:27,633 --> 00:23:28,676
Hey, hold on.

423
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:31,387
My pinkie is fine.

424
00:23:33,264 --> 00:23:34,306
Come on.

425
00:23:37,393 --> 00:23:38,811
I don't have

426
00:23:39,145 --> 00:23:41,397
surgery tomorrow.
I have two surgeries in two days.

427
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,690
I think I can do it.

428
00:23:42,773 --> 00:23:44,567
How will you perform surgery with these?

429
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:47,361
The burns weren't that bad.
Wait, hold on a second.

430
00:23:48,904 --> 00:23:51,615
Hey, did you just turn me
into Demetan Croaker?

431
00:23:51,991 --> 00:23:53,159
You wrapped too much.

432
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:54,994
You're right.

433
00:23:55,995 --> 00:23:58,914
I wrapped it too much.
I'll fix them later.

434
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:00,749
Stay like that for now.

435
00:24:01,542 --> 00:24:02,793
I'm leaving now.

436
00:24:02,877 --> 00:24:04,712
You'll leave me like this?

437
00:24:05,629 --> 00:24:06,464
Yes.

438
00:24:07,173 --> 00:24:08,215
You won't die from it.

439
00:24:08,549 --> 00:24:09,383
Bye.

440
00:24:10,301 --> 00:24:14,680
Hey. Wait. Do you want me
to fill the Rainbow Pond with my tears?

441
00:24:15,556 --> 00:24:18,309
<i>Croak, croak</i>

442
00:24:18,392 --> 00:24:20,895
-Didn't you go to the hospital?
-I did.

443
00:24:21,562 --> 00:24:22,980
I went there yesterday and the day before.

444
00:24:23,564 --> 00:24:25,816
-I've been there since 8 a.m. today.
-Hey!

445
00:24:27,318 --> 00:24:29,904
I don't need to get this checked out.
I'm totally fine.

446
00:24:29,987 --> 00:24:31,071
No, you're not.

447
00:24:32,615 --> 00:24:34,617
Did you break your bone?

448
00:24:35,075 --> 00:24:36,035
What did your kids say?

449
00:24:36,911 --> 00:24:37,745
They don't know.

450
00:24:37,828 --> 00:24:40,122
-Why not?
-I didn't call them.

451
00:24:42,166 --> 00:24:45,085
It's not like I'm dying.
Why would I call them?

452
00:24:46,212 --> 00:24:47,796
What do you want? Coffee?

453
00:24:48,214 --> 00:24:49,590
It's decaf, right?

454
00:24:50,758 --> 00:24:53,010
My goodness. This hurts a bit.

455
00:24:56,305 --> 00:24:57,932
You don't know your son's number?

456
00:24:59,808 --> 00:25:00,893
My oldest son

457
00:25:01,936 --> 00:25:04,647
moved to a new hospital in LA this summer.

458
00:25:05,105 --> 00:25:07,942
He moved to a new house
and changed his phone, too.

459
00:25:09,401 --> 00:25:12,363
-You can ask your second son.
-He doesn't know, either.

460
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:14,657
Besides, Tae-ung is busier.

461
00:25:15,866 --> 00:25:17,993
It's been over two months since I saw him.

462
00:25:18,494 --> 00:25:20,913
-Why do you live like that?
-What do you mean?

463
00:25:20,996 --> 00:25:23,207
I'm living a good life
without my children.

464
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:24,917
Did I tell you to rely on them?

465
00:25:25,543 --> 00:25:28,003
Did I tell you to live with them
and eat together all the time?

466
00:25:29,213 --> 00:25:31,215
They are your children,
and you're their father.

467
00:25:31,715 --> 00:25:33,467
You call your family when you're sick

468
00:25:33,551 --> 00:25:35,261
and celebrate together on happy occasions.

469
00:25:35,344 --> 00:25:36,720
That's what family does.

470
00:25:36,804 --> 00:25:38,973
Why are you all alone? This is pathetic.

471
00:25:39,473 --> 00:25:41,809
-This is annoying.
-My goodness.

472
00:25:42,351 --> 00:25:46,814
I'm happy that they are making
good money and living a good life.

473
00:25:47,398 --> 00:25:48,440
I'm fine.

474
00:25:48,899 --> 00:25:52,444
After my late wife got sick,
I got better at eating alone

475
00:25:52,528 --> 00:25:55,739
and doing laundry. I'm doing well, Rosa.

476
00:25:56,991 --> 00:25:58,075
When your wife was sick,

477
00:25:58,158 --> 00:25:59,994
how many times did Geon-tae
and Tae-ung come to see her?

478
00:26:00,578 --> 00:26:01,787
They came only once.

479
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:04,915
Their own mother was bedridden
for seven years,

480
00:26:04,999 --> 00:26:07,167
unable to move, but they came only once.

481
00:26:08,627 --> 00:26:10,838
How the hell did you raise your kids?

482
00:26:11,338 --> 00:26:13,090
You're frustrating and annoying.

483
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:15,926
You're such a dimwit!

484
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:22,641
Song-hwa, here.

485
00:26:23,809 --> 00:26:28,772
Give two servings to that table
and three servings to ours, ma'am.

486
00:26:30,232 --> 00:26:33,569
Jeong-won is buying dinner tonight,
so we're at a <i>tteokbokki</i> restaurant, Mom.

487
00:26:33,736 --> 00:26:36,113
Right? Rich people are such cheapskates.

488
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:38,157
Okay. Goodnight.

489
00:26:39,241 --> 00:26:41,952
Andrea, can we get <i>jjajang tteokbokki</i>?

490
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:45,039
You two soldiers, go ahead.

491
00:26:45,748 --> 00:26:48,584
Ma'am, two servings
of <i>jjajang tteokbokki,</i> please.

492
00:26:49,627 --> 00:26:52,129
What's the occasion, Jeong-won?
Did your savings account mature?

493
00:26:52,212 --> 00:26:55,674
He did. He put in 100,000 won every month
for three years. It matured today.

494
00:26:55,758 --> 00:26:57,676
He'll send his mom on a trip
for her birthday.

495
00:26:58,469 --> 00:27:00,804
Then, what do you spend your salary on?

496
00:27:01,722 --> 00:27:04,016
What's wrong with your hands?
Are you copying <i>Inside Men</i>?

497
00:27:04,099 --> 00:27:05,351
He recklessly burned his fingers.

498
00:27:05,434 --> 00:27:07,394
The director gave him an earful.

499
00:27:07,478 --> 00:27:10,314
Jeong-won, send your mom to Mojito
and have her drink a glass of Maldives.

500
00:27:13,567 --> 00:27:14,443
Is that funny to you?

501
00:27:15,402 --> 00:27:16,695
I love his jokes.

502
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,701
Jeong-won, you can just tell us now.

503
00:27:23,327 --> 00:27:25,329
-Tell you what?
-I'm sure your father

504
00:27:25,412 --> 00:27:28,040
left something modest in your name
before he passed. Right?

505
00:27:28,582 --> 00:27:32,127
I mean, think about it. You're
the only son left in this secular world.

506
00:27:32,211 --> 00:27:33,170
Thank you.

507
00:27:36,131 --> 00:27:36,965
In fact,

508
00:27:38,008 --> 00:27:39,510
he did pass something down to me.

509
00:27:40,302 --> 00:27:41,762
-What is it?
-What?

510
00:27:43,722 --> 00:27:44,973
He had secretly been

511
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:49,645
donating two million won
to an orphanage every month.

512
00:27:56,443 --> 00:27:57,986
-It's far from ready.
-I know.

513
00:27:59,738 --> 00:28:01,323
You're no fun at all.

514
00:28:02,282 --> 00:28:03,909
-You're no fun.
-Is it cooked?

515
00:28:03,992 --> 00:28:05,494
I think it was an automatic transfer.

516
00:28:06,453 --> 00:28:08,914
I took that over, so I've been
donating every month since then.

517
00:28:08,997 --> 00:28:12,835
Jeong-won, I'll pay for the meal.
That would make me feel at ease.

518
00:28:12,918 --> 00:28:15,713
Guys, it's on me. Eat a lot.
Order as much as you want.

519
00:28:15,796 --> 00:28:17,089
-Will you?
-Yes, that'd be better.

520
00:28:17,172 --> 00:28:19,007
-Do that. That sounds better.
-I saw it coming.

521
00:28:19,091 --> 00:28:21,135
-Can I order some dumplings?
-Go ahead.

522
00:28:21,218 --> 00:28:22,636
Ma'am, two dumplings, please.

523
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,847
Ma'am, give us Sprite and some noodles.

524
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:27,224
-And some Coke, please.
-I want cheese, too.

525
00:28:27,307 --> 00:28:31,603
Guys, no. I can totally pay for this.
My savings account matured today.

526
00:28:31,687 --> 00:28:34,064
-I said I was buying.
-No, that's okay.

527
00:28:34,148 --> 00:28:36,316
It's like taking money from a poor man.

528
00:28:36,525 --> 00:28:39,862
Ma'am, two servings of <i>tteokbokki</i>
for to-go, please.

529
00:28:39,945 --> 00:28:41,989
I want my takeout cooked, please.

530
00:28:47,286 --> 00:28:49,747
Seok-hyeong, how's your mother?

531
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:52,583
What do you think?
It's back to square one.

532
00:28:53,041 --> 00:28:56,128
My goodness,
have some mercy on us, merciful Buddha.

533
00:28:57,296 --> 00:28:58,714
I bet she won't divorce him now.

534
00:28:59,298 --> 00:29:01,717
Exactly. She won't divorce him
no matter what.

535
00:29:02,551 --> 00:29:03,677
I don't know what to do now.

536
00:29:04,261 --> 00:29:07,723
She won't divorce him
even if he gives her all of his properties

537
00:29:07,806 --> 00:29:09,349
and the entire company.

538
00:29:09,433 --> 00:29:12,269
Seok-hyeong. Then,
will all the buildings and properties

539
00:29:12,561 --> 00:29:14,313
be yours when your mother passes away?

540
00:29:15,105 --> 00:29:16,315
Probably.

541
00:29:16,398 --> 00:29:20,819
Hey, can you list me and U-ju
under your family register?

542
00:29:23,739 --> 00:29:25,574
You don't have any children anyway.

543
00:29:25,657 --> 00:29:28,827
Adopt me and U-ju as your sons.

544
00:29:29,828 --> 00:29:33,791
It's only a ten-story building.
And a lot of stores are vacant anyway.

545
00:29:34,291 --> 00:29:35,584
And don't you know my mom?

546
00:29:36,126 --> 00:29:38,337
She'd rather have them vacant
than renting them out.

547
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:39,797
Right. That's true.

548
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:42,883
Right. Dad.

549
00:29:43,425 --> 00:29:46,386
Did the resident who went MIA come back?

550
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:48,430
Not yet. How did you know?

551
00:29:49,014 --> 00:29:50,516
My gosh. My son is so nosy.

552
00:29:50,599 --> 00:29:53,143
I heard people talk.
Everyone at the hospital knows.

553
00:29:53,227 --> 00:29:56,188
I heard that, too.
It must've been hard on the resident.

554
00:29:57,064 --> 00:29:58,273
Be nice to her when she comes back.

555
00:29:59,733 --> 00:30:00,776
Of course.

556
00:30:18,252 --> 00:30:19,711
-Dr. Chu.
-Yes?

557
00:30:22,381 --> 00:30:23,882
I hope you have some time for a snack.

558
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:28,053
Totally. Yes.

559
00:30:35,686 --> 00:30:37,020
It's non-alcoholic.

560
00:30:37,729 --> 00:30:42,276
If I don't drink this today,
I might go crazy and cause a scene.

561
00:30:51,243 --> 00:30:54,037
I'll be on night shifts forever.

562
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:58,000
I was on a night shift yesterday,
and today as well.

563
00:30:58,083 --> 00:30:59,418
I'll be on call tomorrow, too.

564
00:31:02,212 --> 00:31:05,299
My colleague isn't helpful at all.
She's such a pain in the ass.

565
00:31:07,801 --> 00:31:08,969
Is she the only one having a hard time?

566
00:31:09,052 --> 00:31:10,679
Does she think I enjoy working?

567
00:31:10,762 --> 00:31:13,015
Would I come to work shouting,
"Yes! I get to work!"?

568
00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:22,399
Ms. Han, had I known
it would be this hard,

569
00:31:22,482 --> 00:31:26,236
I would have stayed in the lab.

570
00:31:27,112 --> 00:31:30,032
I was sick of staying in the lab
every day.

571
00:31:30,115 --> 00:31:33,285
I became a doctor
since all I ever did was study.

572
00:31:35,037 --> 00:31:36,163
Look at me.

573
00:31:36,914 --> 00:31:39,124
The only colleague I have
is the sliest colleague ever.

574
00:31:40,167 --> 00:31:43,170
And my professor is
the most slow-witted slug ever.

575
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:52,596
I'm done.

576
00:31:54,348 --> 00:31:58,685
As of today,
my career as a doctor will end.

577
00:31:59,478 --> 00:32:00,646
I'll put an end to this.

578
00:32:01,396 --> 00:32:04,191
I'll go tell the slug tomorrow morning.

579
00:32:05,108 --> 00:32:08,570
Look at me. I'm an excellent doctor,
I didn't run away from my job,

580
00:32:08,654 --> 00:32:10,197
and I'm good to my professors.

581
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:12,783
Why? Why does he only comfort her?

582
00:32:13,867 --> 00:32:15,285
Eun-won ran away from her job.

583
00:32:15,369 --> 00:32:17,704
I can't reach her.
And she's not even diligent.

584
00:32:17,788 --> 00:32:20,374
Why is he only nice to her? Why?

585
00:32:27,589 --> 00:32:28,840
Min-ha isn't here yet?

586
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:31,885
Professor Yang.

587
00:32:32,594 --> 00:32:34,888
It's already getting chilly.

588
00:32:35,222 --> 00:32:37,766
Have a cup of hot coffee.

589
00:32:39,101 --> 00:32:41,144
Okay. Thank you.

590
00:32:43,063 --> 00:32:44,147
I'll bring them in.

591
00:32:44,898 --> 00:32:45,941
Okay.

592
00:32:49,027 --> 00:32:49,987
How much drainage?

593
00:32:50,946 --> 00:32:52,948
No, I'll check it myself. Okay.

594
00:32:55,951 --> 00:32:58,328
Please. Please wash my face.

595
00:32:58,412 --> 00:33:00,914
No. I hate touching other men's faces.

596
00:33:04,084 --> 00:33:04,960
Hello.

597
00:33:06,962 --> 00:33:08,046
So cute!

598
00:33:10,048 --> 00:33:12,509
Goodness. I knew I'd find you here.

599
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:14,386
What?

600
00:33:14,469 --> 00:33:16,388
-Help me wash my face.
-What?

601
00:33:16,888 --> 00:33:18,765
I couldn't wash up last night
and this morning.

602
00:33:18,849 --> 00:33:22,019
You know, it feels like
there are bugs all over my face.

603
00:33:23,770 --> 00:33:25,313
Should I help you take a shower?

604
00:33:25,939 --> 00:33:26,773
What?

605
00:33:29,484 --> 00:33:32,112
But you know that
my showers last an hour, right?

606
00:33:34,448 --> 00:33:35,532
I'll wash your face.

607
00:33:36,158 --> 00:33:37,784
But I'll be really thorough with you.

608
00:33:37,868 --> 00:33:39,619
My goodness. Seriously.

609
00:33:42,831 --> 00:33:44,499
You're my last hope, Song-hwa.

610
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:46,585
I have faith in you.

611
00:33:48,754 --> 00:33:50,672
Sorry. I'll come back another time.

612
00:33:51,006 --> 00:33:53,508
That's fine. I'm done putting them on.

613
00:33:55,302 --> 00:33:56,178
Really?

614
00:33:57,888 --> 00:34:00,515
What happened to you?
It looks like you didn't wash up.

615
00:34:05,228 --> 00:34:06,271
Jeez.

616
00:34:13,361 --> 00:34:15,781
My gosh. Whenever patients see me,

617
00:34:15,864 --> 00:34:18,116
they always ask
when they can wash up and wash their hair.

618
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:20,702
Now, I get why.
I can finally breathe again.

619
00:34:21,578 --> 00:34:22,996
Should I wrap bandages again?

620
00:34:23,789 --> 00:34:25,082
You can take them off now.

621
00:34:25,165 --> 00:34:27,292
I need to go see the hospital director.

622
00:34:27,375 --> 00:34:29,753
Gyeo-ul caused some trouble.
Let's have lunch together.

623
00:34:29,836 --> 00:34:31,463
Can you wipe my neck a bit more?

624
00:34:32,047 --> 00:34:34,299
My gosh, that feels so nice.
This side, too.

625
00:34:41,181 --> 00:34:43,350
You're all Dr. Jang's supervisors?

626
00:34:44,559 --> 00:34:46,144
Right. She's in GS.

627
00:34:46,728 --> 00:34:48,355
Yes. It's about my patient.

628
00:34:49,356 --> 00:34:50,982
She's with my department this month.

629
00:34:52,275 --> 00:34:53,860
-Did it all work out?
-Luckily,

630
00:34:54,986 --> 00:34:56,613
-yes.
-Gosh.

631
00:34:56,696 --> 00:34:59,241
It turns out he was a real drug addict.

632
00:34:59,324 --> 00:35:01,326
He got out only a month ago.

633
00:35:02,244 --> 00:35:04,079
He probably doesn't want trouble,

634
00:35:04,162 --> 00:35:06,331
so the chief of the CS Department
apologized this time

635
00:35:06,414 --> 00:35:09,835
and we'll reduce his medical bills.
This all got resolved.

636
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:18,009
Getting calls from the CS Department
is the scariest. It really is.

637
00:35:19,553 --> 00:35:22,597
Anyway, tell the residents
to be more careful.

638
00:35:22,764 --> 00:35:24,224
I know their job is hard,

639
00:35:24,307 --> 00:35:26,852
but what's the point
of treating patients day and night?

640
00:35:26,935 --> 00:35:29,604
If they say a word wrong,
we get complaints right away.

641
00:35:30,564 --> 00:35:33,567
Then, the hospital has to comply
with all of their demands.

642
00:35:35,235 --> 00:35:38,363
And if that happens, we really
might end up with serious problems.

643
00:35:40,407 --> 00:35:43,577
Thank you for your effort.
I'll talk to her.

644
00:35:45,203 --> 00:35:46,037
By the way,

645
00:35:46,997 --> 00:35:50,458
I don't think
Dr. Jang was completely wrong.

646
00:35:51,209 --> 00:35:52,627
I'll talk to her.

647
00:35:53,378 --> 00:35:54,462
I've got to go.

648
00:35:54,838 --> 00:35:57,048
I need to go. A guardian wants to see me.

649
00:36:05,015 --> 00:36:06,099
I'm sorry.

650
00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:08,894
It's all right. Have a good day.

651
00:36:13,857 --> 00:36:14,983
You startled me.

652
00:36:16,151 --> 00:36:18,987
-What are you doing here?
-How did things go?

653
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:20,572
It all worked out well.

654
00:36:21,323 --> 00:36:22,824
He'll take down the post.

655
00:36:22,908 --> 00:36:24,743
It's all resolved now. Don't worry.

656
00:36:27,078 --> 00:36:28,288
Do you want some coffee?

657
00:36:29,998 --> 00:36:32,667
I heard once I'm past 12 weeks,
my pregnancy is considered safe.

658
00:36:32,751 --> 00:36:35,420
You said nuchal translucency
was fine as well.

659
00:36:36,463 --> 00:36:39,674
Doctor, does it mean
I don't have to worry now?

660
00:36:40,175 --> 00:36:43,220
Actually, there's something
that concerns me.

661
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:49,476
There's a lot of blood around the uterus
on your ultrasound.

662
00:36:49,559 --> 00:36:52,604
Finding blood in the uterus at 12 weeks
isn't that common.

663
00:36:54,189 --> 00:36:57,859
This may increase the chance
of a natural miscarriage.

664
00:36:57,943 --> 00:37:00,362
She has to rest up and be careful.

665
00:37:01,154 --> 00:37:04,616
If you see any bleeding,
you must come to the ER at any time.

666
00:37:06,493 --> 00:37:08,828
First, I'll prescribe you
with progesterone,

667
00:37:08,912 --> 00:37:10,622
so it can help your uterus stabilize.

668
00:37:11,373 --> 00:37:12,624
Don't worry.

669
00:37:13,333 --> 00:37:14,542
I'll keep checking.

670
00:37:15,752 --> 00:37:18,797
Let's keep this baby safe no matter what.

671
00:37:49,369 --> 00:37:51,538
I texted Jeong-won to come over.

672
00:37:52,122 --> 00:37:54,207
Wouldn't you rather have him
comfort you than me?

673
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,584
No, it's all right.

674
00:37:57,627 --> 00:37:58,795
I'm sorry.

675
00:38:00,714 --> 00:38:03,216
Don't be disappointed
in the director or the hospital.

676
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,927
There are some good days
and bad days, you know.

677
00:38:06,803 --> 00:38:08,263
And keep your chin up.

678
00:38:08,346 --> 00:38:10,223
And something like this happens again,

679
00:38:10,307 --> 00:38:12,392
make a decision based on your principles.
Just do that.

680
00:38:13,643 --> 00:38:14,978
Thank you.

681
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:18,440
And I don't think

682
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:20,692
Professor Ahn will come.

683
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:23,194
He's been staying in PICU these days.

684
00:38:26,823 --> 00:38:30,535
My goodness, Jeong-won.
What's wrong with that punk?

685
00:38:31,077 --> 00:38:35,040
I hope he can be half as nice
to you as he is to my son, U-ju.

686
00:38:36,833 --> 00:38:38,918
You know, he loves kids.

687
00:38:39,753 --> 00:38:41,963
He came over to my house last weekend

688
00:38:42,047 --> 00:38:43,882
and played with my son the whole day.

689
00:38:45,133 --> 00:38:48,803
Did he go to your house last weekend?

690
00:38:49,387 --> 00:38:51,514
-Yes.
-On Sunday, too?

691
00:38:52,599 --> 00:38:53,975
He came on both days. Why?

692
00:38:57,270 --> 00:38:59,272
He told me he had to go
to Yangpyeong last weekend.

693
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:02,567
He told me that he was busy.

694
00:39:07,822 --> 00:39:09,699
I think I should forget him.

695
00:39:11,659 --> 00:39:13,203
If he's lying to me,

696
00:39:13,787 --> 00:39:15,246
I should stop pursuing him.

697
00:39:18,416 --> 00:39:21,002
Thank you for keeping my secret
all this time.

698
00:39:21,961 --> 00:39:23,088
Thank you for the coffee.

699
00:39:29,469 --> 00:39:31,888
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

700
00:39:39,979 --> 00:39:40,980
Dr. Chu.

701
00:39:41,731 --> 00:39:43,483
Ms. Park Seon-yeong,
the one who gave birth at dawn.

702
00:39:43,566 --> 00:39:45,485
It was a deep laceration,
so I made lots of sutures.

703
00:39:46,194 --> 00:39:48,029
-Is the episiotomy okay?
-Yes.

704
00:39:48,154 --> 00:39:50,365
It was fine after the delivery
before going up to her room.

705
00:39:50,448 --> 00:39:51,991
But I didn't check it afterward.

706
00:39:52,075 --> 00:39:54,494
I'll check on it right away
and notify you. I'm sorry.

707
00:39:54,786 --> 00:39:57,080
Check on patients
once they go up to the ward.

708
00:39:57,831 --> 00:40:00,250
-Okay.
-I'm sorry.

709
00:40:01,543 --> 00:40:02,585
Hello.

710
00:40:09,050 --> 00:40:10,051
I'm sorry.

711
00:40:13,012 --> 00:40:14,305
Are you all right?

712
00:40:14,389 --> 00:40:16,516
Yes. I'm sorry.

713
00:40:17,517 --> 00:40:19,936
Don't be at other department's services
for now. Stay on mine.

714
00:40:20,019 --> 00:40:21,312
I'll straighten it out.

715
00:40:24,649 --> 00:40:27,485
My gosh, look at you, Eun-won.
You lost a lot of weight.

716
00:40:27,569 --> 00:40:28,987
Go home early tonight.

717
00:40:29,863 --> 00:40:32,574
No, I'll go home after I finish my work.

718
00:40:33,450 --> 00:40:34,284
Okay.

719
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:38,830
I'll take over your patients who are
getting admitted today and tomorrow.

720
00:40:40,373 --> 00:40:43,168
Dr. Chu, I'm sorry.

721
00:40:44,335 --> 00:40:47,005
Tonight will be the last time
I'll ask you to take my night shift.

722
00:40:47,589 --> 00:40:48,423
I'm sorry.

723
00:40:50,675 --> 00:40:52,260
No, it's okay.

724
00:40:55,763 --> 00:40:59,809
Ms. Do Jae-yeong will be coming up soon
after the admission process.

725
00:40:59,934 --> 00:41:01,686
Right. It's today.

726
00:41:01,769 --> 00:41:04,022
Ms. Do Jae-yeong will get admitted
this afternoon.

727
00:41:04,105 --> 00:41:06,691
She's sensitive because
she's coming in because of preterm labor.

728
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:07,817
Take good care of her.

729
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:11,446
If the contractions are regular
and her stomach hurts,

730
00:41:11,529 --> 00:41:13,114
check her cervix for dilation.

731
00:41:13,198 --> 00:41:16,451
The baby is only 30 weeks old,
so check the monitor frequently.

732
00:41:16,534 --> 00:41:17,410
Okay.

733
00:41:19,454 --> 00:41:22,123
I'm going to check on a patient
with contractions.

734
00:41:24,626 --> 00:41:27,337
Ms. Han, this is for you.

735
00:41:28,755 --> 00:41:30,548
-What's this?
-Ms. Do Jae-yeong wrote down

736
00:41:30,632 --> 00:41:33,885
a list of things the medical staff
wants to follow before she gets admitted.

737
00:41:34,385 --> 00:41:36,846
Someone delivered it to me.
You should take a look.

738
00:41:39,474 --> 00:41:41,142
I WANT ONLY MY HUSBAND TO MASSAGE ME

739
00:41:41,226 --> 00:41:42,310
DIM LIGHTING WITH CANDLES

740
00:41:42,393 --> 00:41:44,521
ALL THE STAFF MUST BE FEMALE
EXCEPT FOR THE PROFESSOR

741
00:41:50,777 --> 00:41:51,861
Who spoiled the mood?

742
00:41:54,989 --> 00:41:57,534
He's very tired
from getting all the tests today.

743
00:41:58,284 --> 00:42:01,663
Doctor, when will we have the results?

744
00:42:02,497 --> 00:42:04,332
We'll have them in two days
at the earliest.

745
00:42:04,874 --> 00:42:06,209
Sir, did you eat?

746
00:42:06,292 --> 00:42:08,378
I don't have much of an appetite.

747
00:42:10,171 --> 00:42:13,383
I just want to get the surgery
as soon as possible.

748
00:42:14,133 --> 00:42:18,513
You must eat your meals and cheer up
especially at times like this.

749
00:42:18,596 --> 00:42:19,722
Doctor.

750
00:42:20,223 --> 00:42:24,477
If the cancer spread to other organs,
I can't get the surgery, right?

751
00:42:26,521 --> 00:42:28,022
I heard when cancer spreads,

752
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:32,735
it spreads quickly,
so I won't be able to beat cancer.

753
00:42:32,819 --> 00:42:36,573
Dad, we haven't gotten the results yet.
Why are you worried about such things?

754
00:42:37,365 --> 00:42:40,577
Also, even if it did spread, you can get
chemotherapy and take medication.

755
00:42:41,077 --> 00:42:42,328
We can fix it.

756
00:42:42,912 --> 00:42:44,455
You seem to know better than me.

757
00:42:44,539 --> 00:42:45,540
Doctor.

758
00:42:46,416 --> 00:42:47,917
I can't seem to eat.

759
00:42:49,502 --> 00:42:53,715
All of us couldn't eat at all.

760
00:42:57,427 --> 00:42:58,845
Don't you need to go to work?

761
00:42:58,928 --> 00:43:00,763
I took some days off from work.

762
00:43:02,098 --> 00:43:03,600
It's her teacher certification exam soon.

763
00:43:03,683 --> 00:43:05,560
I told her to go and study,
but she won't listen.

764
00:43:06,853 --> 00:43:09,522
The whole family is on pause right now.

765
00:43:11,691 --> 00:43:13,067
My gosh.

766
00:43:24,996 --> 00:43:26,873
-How about this?
-Pardon?

767
00:43:26,956 --> 00:43:30,335
Why don't we move the patient we just
saw, Choe Jung-won, to a six-person room?

768
00:43:30,418 --> 00:43:31,377
Suggest that to them.

769
00:43:32,295 --> 00:43:33,504
That's a great idea.

770
00:43:38,009 --> 00:43:39,510
-Can you help me?
-Okay, I got it.

771
00:43:43,014 --> 00:43:45,099
Yes, this is Kim Jun-wan. Yes.

772
00:43:47,477 --> 00:43:48,853
My gosh. Come on.

773
00:43:50,188 --> 00:43:51,356
Okay. I'll be right upstairs.

774
00:43:52,982 --> 00:43:54,233
This has to be a déjà vu.

775
00:43:54,859 --> 00:43:56,569
Something like this happened a while ago.

776
00:43:57,987 --> 00:43:59,280
Oh, my head.

777
00:43:59,572 --> 00:44:01,449
He said the guardian
was rude on the phone.

778
00:44:01,532 --> 00:44:02,408
Unbelievable.

779
00:44:02,575 --> 00:44:04,285
He should have just cursed at her.

780
00:44:04,702 --> 00:44:06,954
I'd complain too
if I heard something like that.

781
00:44:07,538 --> 00:44:09,290
Who'd stay quiet when someone says

782
00:44:09,374 --> 00:44:11,250
your father is rude on the phone?

783
00:44:12,251 --> 00:44:14,420
Why does his daughter
have to be a lawyer though?

784
00:44:14,504 --> 00:44:16,381
And she's very well-connected.

785
00:44:16,464 --> 00:44:19,217
I barely managed to stop her
from talking to the TV station.

786
00:44:20,259 --> 00:44:22,011
So, what do they want?

787
00:44:22,387 --> 00:44:24,889
An apology and a handwritten letter?
Forget that.

788
00:44:25,223 --> 00:44:26,307
They don't even want money.

789
00:44:26,391 --> 00:44:28,101
Then what are they asking for?

790
00:44:29,644 --> 00:44:30,978
Proper punishment.

791
00:44:31,729 --> 00:44:36,442
They want us to show them
that we're taking this seriously

792
00:44:36,526 --> 00:44:40,113
and how much we want to mend the situation
by penalizing the resident.

793
00:44:41,072 --> 00:44:42,240
So? What did you say?

794
00:44:42,824 --> 00:44:44,158
A pay cut for three months.

795
00:44:45,076 --> 00:44:46,994
A pay cut over something like this?

796
00:44:47,578 --> 00:44:50,206
They're quiet now because I said that.

797
00:44:51,290 --> 00:44:53,334
They said they'd think about it,

798
00:44:53,418 --> 00:44:55,128
which means they're not unhappy with it.

799
00:44:57,130 --> 00:44:57,964
Professor Kim.

800
00:44:59,132 --> 00:45:01,384
Let's just go with this
and get the situation sorted out.

801
00:45:03,886 --> 00:45:06,472
Okay. I have an emergency patient.
Please excuse me.

802
00:45:07,056 --> 00:45:08,015
Hello?

803
00:45:08,558 --> 00:45:09,392
Yes.

804
00:45:11,102 --> 00:45:14,897
I think I'm not living my life well.

805
00:45:16,941 --> 00:45:19,110
I studied for the bar exam
for six long years,

806
00:45:19,193 --> 00:45:21,529
yet I made that ridiculous blunder
when signing my new lease.

807
00:45:24,532 --> 00:45:26,159
And what kind of chief resident

808
00:45:26,242 --> 00:45:28,453
spews such nonsense
to someone who is devastated

809
00:45:29,579 --> 00:45:30,997
because of their ill mother?

810
00:45:32,331 --> 00:45:34,417
Gosh, seriously. What is wrong with me?

811
00:45:36,669 --> 00:45:38,796
I'm bad at my job because I'm dumb.

812
00:45:39,756 --> 00:45:41,549
There's nothing I can do.

813
00:45:43,634 --> 00:45:45,094
My existence is harming others.

814
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:50,767
Hey.

815
00:45:51,684 --> 00:45:53,019
If you ever run into me

816
00:45:54,020 --> 00:45:55,229
at a hospital somewhere,

817
00:45:56,439 --> 00:45:57,940
don't pretend as if you don't know me.

818
00:45:58,775 --> 00:46:00,902
We've been through thick and thin together

819
00:46:00,985 --> 00:46:02,528
-for years, you know.
-Gosh, please.

820
00:46:02,987 --> 00:46:04,405
What the heck are you talking about?

821
00:46:04,822 --> 00:46:06,032
Have you gone mad?

822
00:46:06,115 --> 00:46:07,867
Why are you quitting? Why would you quit?

823
00:46:07,950 --> 00:46:09,285
I won't let you quit.

824
00:46:11,913 --> 00:46:13,039
You're right.

825
00:46:14,123 --> 00:46:15,500
I sure can't quit.

826
00:46:18,336 --> 00:46:20,004
I'm working the night shift today.

827
00:46:21,714 --> 00:46:24,133
Damn it. I have to go.

828
00:46:35,728 --> 00:46:37,146
Patient Do Jae-yeong isn't here yet?

829
00:46:37,230 --> 00:46:38,940
No, but she's coming up now.

830
00:46:39,357 --> 00:46:42,068
Then I'll check her in before I leave.

831
00:46:42,193 --> 00:46:43,277
Okay.

832
00:46:43,444 --> 00:46:45,363
She's my patient,

833
00:46:45,446 --> 00:46:46,906
but I have to go into the OR now.

834
00:46:46,989 --> 00:46:48,991
Could you please have
the doctor on the night shift

835
00:46:49,075 --> 00:46:51,077
take care of the patient for me?

836
00:46:51,828 --> 00:46:53,955
Oh, sure.

837
00:46:55,790 --> 00:46:56,707
What the...

838
00:47:00,795 --> 00:47:02,004
Hello.

839
00:47:02,088 --> 00:47:03,965
Oh, we're not even set up yet.

840
00:47:04,048 --> 00:47:05,508
Why did you come so early?

841
00:47:05,842 --> 00:47:07,385
The professor left just now.

842
00:47:07,468 --> 00:47:09,136
The C-section ended
just a few minutes ago.

843
00:47:09,887 --> 00:47:11,681
I wanted to help you with the preparation.

844
00:47:18,437 --> 00:47:20,231
Dr. Myeong, you're scrubbing in?

845
00:47:20,314 --> 00:47:21,858
I was expecting the chief resident.

846
00:47:22,817 --> 00:47:24,485
I want to watch and learn.

847
00:47:25,069 --> 00:47:26,571
I still have a lot to learn.

848
00:47:27,572 --> 00:47:28,656
All right, sounds good.

849
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:31,284
I'll be in my office.
Page me when everything's ready.

850
00:47:31,868 --> 00:47:32,910
Yes, Professor.

851
00:47:33,411 --> 00:47:35,329
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

852
00:47:39,834 --> 00:47:40,960
Dr. Chu.

853
00:47:41,878 --> 00:47:42,753
Yes.

854
00:47:42,837 --> 00:47:45,339
Everything seems okay
with the patient, Do Jae-yeong,

855
00:47:45,423 --> 00:47:47,675
but she doesn't feel any movement.
She wants you to check.

856
00:47:47,758 --> 00:47:50,428
Again? This is the third time,
for God's sake.

857
00:47:51,304 --> 00:47:52,430
Gosh.

858
00:47:53,514 --> 00:47:55,308
The baby is moving.

859
00:47:55,391 --> 00:47:57,977
It's probably just that
you can't really feel it.

860
00:47:58,060 --> 00:48:00,605
Everything looks good,
so we'll just wait and see.

861
00:48:00,688 --> 00:48:03,733
Doctor, did you wash your hands?

862
00:48:04,650 --> 00:48:07,737
Yes, I did. Just before I came here.
Don't worry.

863
00:48:08,321 --> 00:48:09,989
I don't want to be hooked up
to that monitor.

864
00:48:10,615 --> 00:48:12,283
It's so uncomfortable.
Can you take it off?

865
00:48:12,408 --> 00:48:13,743
I can't sleep.

866
00:48:16,037 --> 00:48:19,332
Without it, we can't really see
how the baby is doing,

867
00:48:19,415 --> 00:48:20,541
so we'll be worried.

868
00:48:21,334 --> 00:48:23,336
I know it's uncomfortable,
but we have to keep it on.

869
00:48:23,419 --> 00:48:24,921
Why don't you just get rid of it

870
00:48:25,004 --> 00:48:27,465
and check in on me more often instead?

871
00:48:38,351 --> 00:48:40,269
PEDIATRIC INTENSIVE CARE UNIT

872
00:48:48,361 --> 00:48:50,655
CHIEF DO JAE-HAK

873
00:49:02,583 --> 00:49:05,294
I'm not even the backup
for the night shift today.

874
00:49:05,378 --> 00:49:07,004
Isn't that Professor Cheon's patient?

875
00:49:07,088 --> 00:49:08,547
<i>Yes, that's right.</i>

876
00:49:08,631 --> 00:49:10,675
<i>And he's the backup
for the night shift today.</i>

877
00:49:10,758 --> 00:49:14,136
<i>But when he was leaving,
he told me not to call him.</i>

878
00:49:14,470 --> 00:49:15,680
Jeez.

879
00:49:16,055 --> 00:49:18,516
<i>He told me to just go ahead
and make my own decisions,</i>

880
00:49:18,808 --> 00:49:20,977
<i>but I'm not sure
whether I made the right decision.</i>

881
00:49:21,310 --> 00:49:22,520
How much epinephrine?

882
00:49:22,603 --> 00:49:23,604
<i>She got 0.2 micrograms.</i>

883
00:49:23,688 --> 00:49:26,524
<i>But the BP keeps dropping,
and the test results aren't looking good.</i>

884
00:49:26,607 --> 00:49:29,235
<i>We've been adjusting the setting,
but CO2 keeps filling up.</i>

885
00:49:29,318 --> 00:49:31,320
<i>And her BP is hovering around 50 to 60
at the moment.</i>

886
00:49:31,404 --> 00:49:34,782
<i>I'm wondering if we should open the chest
and do a shunt revision,</i>

887
00:49:34,865 --> 00:49:36,951
<i>but I'm not sure.
What should we do, Professor?</i>

888
00:49:37,034 --> 00:49:39,954
All right. If the BP keeps dropping,
try using vasopressin.

889
00:49:40,037 --> 00:49:41,288
I'll be there as soon as I can.

890
00:50:28,210 --> 00:50:30,004
We don't need to open the chest for this.

891
00:50:32,715 --> 00:50:33,549
You watched her well.

892
00:50:44,310 --> 00:50:45,644
Professor Kim.

893
00:50:51,692 --> 00:50:55,196
Professor Kim, I have to talk to you
about something.

894
00:50:58,657 --> 00:51:00,576
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

895
00:51:03,245 --> 00:51:05,539
This is my ex-colleague.

896
00:51:05,623 --> 00:51:07,917
He's been asking me to set him up
with a fellow doctor.

897
00:51:08,793 --> 00:51:11,295
You should meet him.
No more one-sided crush.

898
00:51:15,049 --> 00:51:16,258
It's all right.

899
00:51:18,636 --> 00:51:19,887
It's not all right.

900
00:51:21,555 --> 00:51:23,516
I've already set a time and date for it.

901
00:51:26,519 --> 00:51:29,522
Tomorrow at 7 p.m. Look for a black SUV.

902
00:51:29,605 --> 00:51:31,774
He'll be waiting for you
at the entrance by the ER.

903
00:51:32,274 --> 00:51:33,651
Just go and have dinner with him.

904
00:51:33,734 --> 00:51:35,486
I know you're busy,
but you still need to eat.

905
00:51:38,697 --> 00:51:39,615
Okay.

906
00:51:40,199 --> 00:51:41,742
Good. That's what I like to hear.

907
00:51:42,326 --> 00:51:45,246
All right, then. Let's get some sleep now.

908
00:51:54,255 --> 00:51:57,258
ELAPSED TIME

909
00:52:08,352 --> 00:52:09,854
It keeps ripping.

910
00:52:17,319 --> 00:52:19,989
Professor,
it is better than before the surgery.

911
00:52:20,573 --> 00:52:21,699
But it keeps leaking.

912
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:24,660
There's nothing more we can do.

913
00:52:24,910 --> 00:52:27,538
The annulus is small to begin with,
so we can't tighten it further.

914
00:52:27,705 --> 00:52:29,456
And the leaflet itself
isn't fully developed,

915
00:52:29,540 --> 00:52:31,083
so I keep cutting through it.

916
00:52:31,667 --> 00:52:33,085
I'm just ruining the shape here.

917
00:52:43,888 --> 00:52:45,431
BP is still low.

918
00:52:45,931 --> 00:52:47,850
Professor, this will be difficult.

919
00:52:49,351 --> 00:52:50,394
What did you give?

920
00:52:50,477 --> 00:52:52,479
Epinephrine, 0.05
and five micrograms of dobutamine.

921
00:52:52,563 --> 00:52:54,315
For epinephrine, move it up to 0.1.

922
00:52:58,110 --> 00:52:59,904
JO MUN-JEONG'S BABY, MALE, 3 WEEKS OLD

923
00:53:00,279 --> 00:53:02,072
Epinephrine can go up to 0.2.

924
00:53:02,156 --> 00:53:03,365
Got it.

925
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:22,593
I'm leaving for the day.

926
00:53:23,010 --> 00:53:24,595
You must have a date.

927
00:53:24,845 --> 00:53:26,639
No, I'm having dinner with my mom.

928
00:53:29,475 --> 00:53:32,394
Patient Lee Su-yeon lost a lot of blood
during delivery. Is she okay?

929
00:53:32,686 --> 00:53:35,022
Well, the bleeding has stopped.

930
00:53:35,105 --> 00:53:37,316
I checked her hemoglobin count.
It's around nine,

931
00:53:37,399 --> 00:53:39,735
and her pulse is around 90.
She's pretty stable now.

932
00:53:39,818 --> 00:53:42,363
Really? She'll be okay, then.
Take it easy.

933
00:53:49,954 --> 00:53:51,747
I'm the only one who's stuck here.

934
00:54:15,187 --> 00:54:16,105
Honey.

935
00:54:18,983 --> 00:54:20,067
Can we talk for a moment?

936
00:54:30,536 --> 00:54:32,621
COMMON TEMPLATE FORMS

937
00:54:35,249 --> 00:54:37,918
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

938
00:54:38,502 --> 00:54:41,755
Doctor, Do Jae-yeong is experiencing
abdominal pain. Can you check on her?

939
00:54:45,009 --> 00:54:45,843
Please?

940
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:47,594
Dr. Chu.

941
00:54:48,178 --> 00:54:51,515
This is the second time, tonight alone.

942
00:54:52,099 --> 00:54:55,602
Okay, I'll go check.

943
00:54:56,270 --> 00:54:58,439
She might be my last patient,

944
00:54:59,148 --> 00:55:01,567
so I should go check on her. Jeez.

945
00:55:01,650 --> 00:55:03,027
DO JAE-YEONG

946
00:55:09,033 --> 00:55:10,993
Hello, let me have a look.

947
00:55:19,126 --> 00:55:21,712
Ms. Do, please stay with us.

948
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:23,589
This looks like placental abruption.

949
00:55:23,672 --> 00:55:24,590
What do we do?

950
00:55:39,730 --> 00:55:41,982
I'll let the professors know.

951
00:55:49,907 --> 00:55:52,451
Professor, Do Jae-yeong needs surgery now.

952
00:55:52,534 --> 00:55:53,786
She passed a lot of blood clots,

953
00:55:53,869 --> 00:55:55,662
and the baby's pulse
is hovering around 80.

954
00:55:55,746 --> 00:55:57,498
Hurry. We need you here
as soon as possible.

955
00:55:57,581 --> 00:55:58,999
<i>Get an OR first.</i>

956
00:55:59,416 --> 00:56:00,417
<i>And call Pediatrics.</i>

957
00:56:00,501 --> 00:56:01,919
Okay, got it.

958
00:56:10,886 --> 00:56:14,098
Professor, we have a pregnant patient
in critical condition. We need an OR now.

959
00:56:14,181 --> 00:56:15,891
She might lose the baby. Please hurry.

960
00:56:15,974 --> 00:56:17,309
It's a placental abruption.

961
00:56:17,393 --> 00:56:18,435
She's bleeding a lot.

962
00:56:18,519 --> 00:56:21,021
Yes, as soon as possible. Thank you.

963
00:56:23,023 --> 00:56:24,274
Doctor, this is Chu Min-ha.

964
00:56:24,358 --> 00:56:26,819
A pregnant patient in week 30
has placental abruption.

965
00:56:26,902 --> 00:56:28,612
We'll begin the surgery right away,

966
00:56:28,695 --> 00:56:30,030
so please come to the OR.

967
00:56:30,114 --> 00:56:32,157
Yes, thank you.

968
00:56:46,505 --> 00:56:47,965
Sir, I'm sorry to ask you this,

969
00:56:48,340 --> 00:56:51,593
but my pregnant patient is
in critical condition, so I'm in a rush.

970
00:56:52,678 --> 00:56:54,847
If you get a speeding ticket,
I'll take care of it.

971
00:56:54,930 --> 00:56:57,891
I'm sorry.
Please drive as fast as you can.

972
00:56:57,975 --> 00:56:58,976
Sure.

973
00:57:09,194 --> 00:57:12,364
Min-ha, call whoever you can
get a hold of and get the baby out.

974
00:57:12,448 --> 00:57:13,657
<i>No one else is available.</i>

975
00:57:13,740 --> 00:57:15,325
<i>The fellow is doing a C-section,</i>

976
00:57:15,409 --> 00:57:17,619
<i>and the chief resident
is performing emergency surgery.</i>

977
00:57:18,203 --> 00:57:19,371
<i>What do I do, Professor?</i>

978
00:57:19,455 --> 00:57:21,373
<i>What if she dies?</i>

979
00:57:24,501 --> 00:57:25,502
I'll be there in five.

980
00:57:26,044 --> 00:57:28,505
Seven minutes, including the time
it takes to go up there.

981
00:57:28,881 --> 00:57:30,924
You may need to get the baby out
before I get there.

982
00:57:31,633 --> 00:57:32,468
You can do it, right?

983
00:57:33,635 --> 00:57:35,012
No, I can't.

984
00:57:35,095 --> 00:57:37,222
I'm only a second-year resident.

985
00:57:37,306 --> 00:57:39,433
<i>Then what? Will you let
both the mom and the baby die?</i>

986
00:57:39,975 --> 00:57:41,685
<i>Go! Get the baby out!</i>

987
00:57:45,606 --> 00:57:46,940
<i>Put me on speaker.</i>

988
00:57:47,524 --> 00:57:48,609
<i>I'll walk you through.</i>

989
00:57:48,692 --> 00:57:50,235
<i>I'll tell you exactly what to do,</i>

990
00:57:50,986 --> 00:57:52,488
<i>so don't worry and just get started.</i>

991
00:57:54,698 --> 00:57:55,991
<i>You got this, Min-ha.</i>

992
00:57:56,992 --> 00:57:58,535
<i>Stay focused.</i>

993
00:58:05,792 --> 00:58:06,919
PROFESSOR YANG SEOK-HYEONG

994
00:58:19,765 --> 00:58:21,892
Hurry, her BP will drop.

995
00:58:53,465 --> 00:58:54,883
Are her vitals okay?

996
00:58:54,967 --> 00:58:56,468
The bleeding is ongoing.

997
00:58:56,552 --> 00:58:58,428
We must get the baby out
as soon as we can.

998
00:58:58,512 --> 00:58:59,596
Professor.

999
00:59:00,347 --> 00:59:02,683
I'll take it from here.
Go to the other side.

1000
00:59:31,295 --> 00:59:32,588
The baby's coming out.

1001
01:00:17,841 --> 01:00:19,801
Thank you, sweetheart.

1002
01:00:20,636 --> 01:00:23,096
Doctor, the baby is alive.

1003
01:00:26,516 --> 01:00:28,143
First layer, please.

1004
01:00:28,226 --> 01:00:29,645
FIRST LAYER:
TOOLS FOR SUTURE

1005
01:00:32,314 --> 01:00:33,190
Well done.

1006
01:00:35,942 --> 01:00:38,236
You did well, Dr. Chu.

1007
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:41,281
Thank you, Professor.

1008
01:00:49,998 --> 01:00:53,377
If everything else was good,
a transplant would be an option.

1009
01:00:53,669 --> 01:00:57,005
But unfortunately, that is not the case.

1010
01:00:57,714 --> 01:00:59,633
I'm suspecting a genetic disorder,

1011
01:01:00,217 --> 01:01:02,219
and the brain isn't looking good either.

1012
01:01:03,303 --> 01:01:06,973
The heart too. We can't keep depending
on the ECMO machine,

1013
01:01:08,183 --> 01:01:09,059
so I'm afraid

1014
01:01:11,144 --> 01:01:12,479
there's nothing more we can do.

1015
01:01:16,024 --> 01:01:18,318
Hun must be in a lot of pain now, right?

1016
01:01:21,697 --> 01:01:23,240
We should probably let him go.

1017
01:01:24,032 --> 01:01:24,991
Right, Doctor?

1018
01:01:32,290 --> 01:01:33,125
Honey.

1019
01:01:37,295 --> 01:01:38,130
We should

1020
01:01:39,631 --> 01:01:40,757
let Hun go now.

1021
01:01:42,801 --> 01:01:44,553
That poor little thing is suffering...

1022
01:01:49,307 --> 01:01:50,767
Don't give him more inotropes.

1023
01:01:50,851 --> 01:01:51,977
INOTROPICS:
ALTERS MUSCULAR CONTRACTIONS

1024
01:01:55,605 --> 01:01:56,481
I'm sorry.

1025
01:02:12,330 --> 01:02:13,498
Who is it?

1026
01:02:13,582 --> 01:02:14,708
It's me, Min-ha.

1027
01:02:14,791 --> 01:02:15,834
Come in.

1028
01:02:22,924 --> 01:02:24,050
Have a seat.

1029
01:02:25,969 --> 01:02:27,095
This isn't my mess.

1030
01:02:27,179 --> 01:02:28,472
It's all his.

1031
01:02:29,347 --> 01:02:30,348
Oh, I see.

1032
01:02:32,058 --> 01:02:33,018
Is that a bribe?

1033
01:02:33,894 --> 01:02:34,728
Yes.

1034
01:02:38,648 --> 01:02:42,027
This is perfect. It doesn't look like
I can go home today anyway.

1035
01:02:46,990 --> 01:02:48,492
I'm sorry, Professor.

1036
01:02:49,242 --> 01:02:50,076
For what?

1037
01:02:50,660 --> 01:02:52,287
To tell you the truth,

1038
01:02:53,079 --> 01:02:56,666
I've been thinking
that you're kind of obnoxious.

1039
01:02:57,167 --> 01:02:58,251
I always thought

1040
01:02:59,127 --> 01:03:01,129
you were emotionally sensitive

1041
01:03:01,213 --> 01:03:03,882
and detail-oriented
unlike how you come across.

1042
01:03:04,716 --> 01:03:08,637
But I realized you can be
pretty slow-witted at times,

1043
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:10,514
so I've been bitching about you to myself.

1044
01:03:12,891 --> 01:03:14,017
I'm sorry.

1045
01:03:15,477 --> 01:03:19,648
I could tell what was going on,

1046
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:23,151
but residents have their own rules,
you know.

1047
01:03:23,443 --> 01:03:24,778
I knew you were stressed out,

1048
01:03:25,445 --> 01:03:28,365
but I just didn't know
how I should get involved

1049
01:03:29,324 --> 01:03:30,617
and sort out the situation.

1050
01:03:31,743 --> 01:03:32,577
Sorry.

1051
01:03:33,537 --> 01:03:35,372
For not looking out for you.

1052
01:03:35,956 --> 01:03:37,123
I've been a little...

1053
01:03:38,542 --> 01:03:39,501
I mean, a lot.

1054
01:03:41,002 --> 01:03:43,296
My feelings were really hurt, Professor.

1055
01:03:44,047 --> 01:03:45,131
Right, I'm sure.

1056
01:03:45,715 --> 01:03:47,133
I have a lot to learn.

1057
01:03:49,511 --> 01:03:50,971
If something like this happens again,

1058
01:03:51,721 --> 01:03:53,682
I'll step in and get it all sorted out.

1059
01:03:54,766 --> 01:03:56,017
I'm really sorry.

1060
01:03:57,269 --> 01:03:58,520
It's okay.

1061
01:03:59,521 --> 01:04:01,773
I said a lot of mean things about you
to myself,

1062
01:04:02,274 --> 01:04:03,483
so let's call it even.

1063
01:04:13,493 --> 01:04:14,369
Min-ha.

1064
01:04:16,496 --> 01:04:20,917
I prefer people who are responsible

1065
01:04:22,794 --> 01:04:24,254
over those who are brainy and smart.

1066
01:04:27,465 --> 01:04:28,967
On my way here,

1067
01:04:29,050 --> 01:04:30,760
the taxi had to stop at a few red lights.

1068
01:04:31,511 --> 01:04:33,597
But every time that happened,
I got so anxious thinking

1069
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:35,432
that you might quit
if we lost the patient.

1070
01:04:36,850 --> 01:04:38,059
Do you know how worried I was?

1071
01:04:42,731 --> 01:04:43,899
I know

1072
01:04:44,691 --> 01:04:46,192
that you'll be a good doctor.

1073
01:04:50,155 --> 01:04:53,325
You dealt with it responsibly.
You didn't run away,

1074
01:04:53,950 --> 01:04:55,368
and you did your very best.

1075
01:04:56,411 --> 01:04:57,495
You know what?

1076
01:04:58,371 --> 01:04:59,789
You did an excellent job today.

1077
01:05:02,959 --> 01:05:04,294
Thank you, Professor.

1078
01:05:04,669 --> 01:05:05,962
Go get some sleep.

1079
01:05:06,755 --> 01:05:09,299
I'll answer all the calls
regarding Do Jae-yeong.

1080
01:05:10,216 --> 01:05:12,177
-Professor.
-Yes?

1081
01:05:13,803 --> 01:05:15,430
Thank you for the <i>tteokbokki</i>.

1082
01:05:16,723 --> 01:05:19,017
Ms. Han told me earlier.

1083
01:05:19,100 --> 01:05:21,102
Oh, I see. No problem.

1084
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:24,397
The day when I totally lost it,

1085
01:05:25,523 --> 01:05:27,692
you went and picked up <i>tteokbokki</i> for me

1086
01:05:27,776 --> 01:05:30,362
and asked everyone
to take good care of me.

1087
01:05:30,445 --> 01:05:32,489
You were the only one who did that for me.

1088
01:05:33,949 --> 01:05:37,535
She told me not to hate
the sensitive slug too much.

1089
01:05:39,537 --> 01:05:42,040
All right. Go get some sleep now.

1090
01:05:43,083 --> 01:05:44,834
Why didn't you tell me any of that?

1091
01:05:45,335 --> 01:05:47,379
If you did,
I wouldn't have bitched about you as much.

1092
01:05:47,462 --> 01:05:50,382
I figured bitching about me
would help you de-stress.

1093
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:53,134
Anyway, go get some sleep.

1094
01:05:53,426 --> 01:05:54,886
I'm going to wash up.

1095
01:05:56,846 --> 01:05:57,806
Thanks, Dad.

1096
01:05:57,889 --> 01:06:00,392
Gosh, I said I'd take care of the bill.

1097
01:06:00,475 --> 01:06:01,518
Thanks.

1098
01:06:01,601 --> 01:06:02,644
-I'd like to pay.
-Sure.

1099
01:06:02,727 --> 01:06:04,229
-I'll pay for the to-go as well.
-Sure.

1100
01:06:10,527 --> 01:06:11,736
Enjoy.

1101
01:06:13,613 --> 01:06:14,698
Thank you for this.

1102
01:06:14,781 --> 01:06:16,032
You came back because of this?

1103
01:06:16,116 --> 01:06:18,702
Yes, I was worried about Dr. Chu.

1104
01:06:19,285 --> 01:06:21,538
Please take good care of her.
She must be stressed out now.

1105
01:06:22,122 --> 01:06:23,123
Will do.

1106
01:06:23,206 --> 01:06:25,291
Oh, don't tell her that it's from me.

1107
01:06:25,375 --> 01:06:27,002
-Okay.
-I'm off.

1108
01:06:27,085 --> 01:06:28,044
-Bye.
-Take it easy.

1109
01:06:41,725 --> 01:06:42,642
Hi, honey.

1110
01:06:43,768 --> 01:06:44,978
Did you have dinner?

1111
01:06:46,855 --> 01:06:49,274
Yes, I still have some things
to finish off.

1112
01:06:50,650 --> 01:06:52,360
We'll lose

1113
01:06:52,777 --> 01:06:55,613
a beautiful baby soon.

1114
01:06:56,614 --> 01:06:58,241
I have to say goodbye to the baby.

1115
01:06:59,993 --> 01:07:00,827
Yes.

1116
01:07:02,328 --> 01:07:03,163
Okay.

1117
01:07:06,249 --> 01:07:09,711
I'll see you on the weekend, honey.

1118
01:07:10,378 --> 01:07:11,421
Yes, thanks.

1119
01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:14,966
I love you.

1120
01:07:19,888 --> 01:07:22,766
My gosh, it sounds like you two are still
in the honeymoon phase.

1121
01:07:27,353 --> 01:07:29,105
What's going on
with your resignation letter?

1122
01:07:29,189 --> 01:07:30,398
What did Professor Kim say?

1123
01:07:32,244 --> 01:07:33,995
What's going on
with your resignation letter?

1124
01:07:34,079 --> 01:07:35,288
What did Professor Kim say?

1125
01:07:36,123 --> 01:07:37,916
Professor Kim Jun-wan

1126
01:07:38,583 --> 01:07:41,711
has no interest
in other people's personal lives.

1127
01:07:47,259 --> 01:07:48,885
Even now,

1128
01:07:49,594 --> 01:07:53,431
he went to say something very cruel
to the couple

1129
01:07:54,850 --> 01:07:56,143
who just lost their baby.

1130
01:08:18,123 --> 01:08:20,041
You must be devastated.

1131
01:08:20,709 --> 01:08:23,295
I'm sorry to have to ask you this,
knowing that.

1132
01:08:26,381 --> 01:08:27,424
May I ask you

1133
01:08:29,342 --> 01:08:31,052
to donate Hun's heart?

1134
01:08:37,017 --> 01:08:38,935
It's such a rare condition.

1135
01:08:41,521 --> 01:08:43,440
If I get another patient like Hun...

1136
01:08:45,984 --> 01:08:47,235
I want to save them.

1137
01:08:50,155 --> 01:08:51,448
I know this is a lot to ask,

1138
01:08:53,825 --> 01:08:55,368
but if you donate Hun's heart to us,

1139
01:08:56,620 --> 01:08:57,829
we'll study it

1140
01:08:59,664 --> 01:09:02,000
and make sure no other baby dies

1141
01:09:03,627 --> 01:09:04,961
from the same condition.

1142
01:09:12,510 --> 01:09:13,720
It'll be a difficult decision,

1143
01:09:14,888 --> 01:09:15,805
but please

1144
01:09:18,058 --> 01:09:18,975
kindly consider it.

1145
01:09:23,855 --> 01:09:24,731
I'm sorry again.

1146
01:10:09,734 --> 01:10:13,738
FOR MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS ONLY

1147
01:10:22,664 --> 01:10:23,915
Jo Mun-jeong's baby

1148
01:10:24,874 --> 01:10:26,126
expired

1149
01:10:28,420 --> 01:10:29,504
at 11:05 p.m.

1150
01:10:35,510 --> 01:10:36,511
Hun...

1151
01:10:39,055 --> 01:10:41,349
Daddy is so sorry.

1152
01:10:42,684 --> 01:10:43,810
I'm sorry.

1153
01:10:54,279 --> 01:10:55,155
Daddy is...

1154
01:11:02,454 --> 01:11:04,456
<i>Andrea, have you decided on the date yet?</i>

1155
01:11:04,539 --> 01:11:07,959
Father, I have operations
booked back to back until December.

1156
01:11:08,543 --> 01:11:10,587
The earliest would be
sometime at the end of December.

1157
01:11:10,837 --> 01:11:11,671
Would that be okay?

1158
01:11:11,755 --> 01:11:13,340
<i>Yes, I think so.</i>

1159
01:11:13,757 --> 01:11:15,175
<i>They know all about your situation,</i>

1160
01:11:15,258 --> 01:11:17,719
<i>so they'll be able to make it work.</i>

1161
01:11:18,053 --> 01:11:20,889
I see. I know you're a busy man.
I'm sorry to bother you with this.

1162
01:11:23,475 --> 01:11:26,519
No, I'm still trying to persuade Mom.

1163
01:11:27,937 --> 01:11:28,772
Yes.

1164
01:11:29,481 --> 01:11:31,232
Okay, thank you.

1165
01:11:38,531 --> 01:11:40,492
Dr. Do, what brings you to my office?

1166
01:11:42,327 --> 01:11:45,205
Oh, I already spoke
with Professor Kim Jun-wan.

1167
01:11:46,664 --> 01:11:49,751
But I guess he's busy.
He hasn't said anything since then.

1168
01:11:49,834 --> 01:11:51,211
Oh, that.

1169
01:11:53,213 --> 01:11:55,590
It's been sorted out. You didn't hear?

1170
01:11:56,216 --> 01:12:00,178
Oh, does that mean
my letter of resignation was accepted?

1171
01:12:00,762 --> 01:12:01,846
What are you talking about?

1172
01:12:03,306 --> 01:12:05,892
The three-month pay cut.

1173
01:12:05,975 --> 01:12:07,352
It's been all sorted out.

1174
01:12:07,435 --> 01:12:08,269
Pardon?

1175
01:12:09,145 --> 01:12:10,021
Really?

1176
01:12:10,605 --> 01:12:11,439
Yes.

1177
01:12:11,940 --> 01:12:14,776
The chief of CS turned it down.

1178
01:12:14,859 --> 01:12:18,863
By "CS," I mean Cardiothoracic Surgery.

1179
01:12:20,115 --> 01:12:24,285
Regarding residents, each division's
chief makes the final call.

1180
01:12:24,369 --> 01:12:26,830
And the chief of CS turned it down,

1181
01:12:27,997 --> 01:12:30,041
which means you don't need
to worry about it anymore.

1182
01:12:30,500 --> 01:12:31,584
You didn't know?

1183
01:12:32,752 --> 01:12:35,380
But the chief position for our division
is vacant at the moment.

1184
01:12:36,464 --> 01:12:38,466
It no longer is.
We filled the position recently.

1185
01:12:39,217 --> 01:12:40,260
Very recently.

1186
01:12:50,061 --> 01:12:50,895
Hello?

1187
01:12:52,355 --> 01:12:53,189
Who is this?

1188
01:12:55,066 --> 01:12:56,234
Hello, Professor. It's Jun-wan.

1189
01:12:56,901 --> 01:12:58,027
<i>Why are you calling so late?</i>

1190
01:13:00,029 --> 01:13:02,657
I'll do it. I'll take the chief position.

1191
01:13:02,740 --> 01:13:05,660
<i>What the heck are you talking about?</i>

1192
01:13:07,495 --> 01:13:10,915
<i>Hey, you... You just said you will do it.</i>

1193
01:13:11,332 --> 01:13:13,543
<i>You can't take this back, okay?</i>

1194
01:13:13,626 --> 01:13:15,253
All right. I'm sorry I woke you up.

1195
01:13:15,336 --> 01:13:16,754
Okay, see you at work.

1196
01:13:19,799 --> 01:13:24,095
And Jun-wan... I mean, Professor Jun-wan
spoke with the guardian on the phone.

1197
01:13:24,179 --> 01:13:26,848
They said they'd just let it go
if you apologized.

1198
01:13:28,683 --> 01:13:30,560
And he apologized on your behalf.

1199
01:13:31,269 --> 01:13:33,480
He told them you're one of the residents
he's mentoring

1200
01:13:33,563 --> 01:13:36,649
and that he will make sure
it won't happen again.

1201
01:13:38,318 --> 01:13:40,195
I think he was able
to build rapport with them.

1202
01:13:42,489 --> 01:13:44,532
Gosh, Kim Jun-wan...

1203
01:13:44,741 --> 01:13:47,076
He's so good to his students.

1204
01:13:47,494 --> 01:13:49,329
If only he were this good
to his professors.

1205
01:13:55,668 --> 01:13:57,629
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

1206
01:14:01,466 --> 01:14:04,344
KIM JUN-WAN
AHN JEONG-WON

1207
01:14:04,427 --> 01:14:05,303
Who is it?

1208
01:14:05,887 --> 01:14:07,138
It's me, Jae-hak.

1209
01:14:11,518 --> 01:14:12,769
Do you have a black suit?

1210
01:14:13,353 --> 01:14:15,104
-Yes.
-Then go get changed.

1211
01:14:15,188 --> 01:14:16,564
I'll meet you in the lobby.

1212
01:14:28,284 --> 01:14:29,410
Well...

1213
01:14:30,995 --> 01:14:32,038
In conclusion,

1214
01:14:34,457 --> 01:14:35,833
it hasn't spread.

1215
01:14:36,543 --> 01:14:38,795
-Thank God!
-My gosh!

1216
01:14:39,546 --> 01:14:40,838
Gosh...

1217
01:14:41,923 --> 01:14:43,132
My gosh.

1218
01:14:43,383 --> 01:14:45,051
-Thank you, Doctor.
-Thank you.

1219
01:14:45,552 --> 01:14:48,179
Dad, you're good.

1220
01:14:48,263 --> 01:14:49,514
You're good now.

1221
01:14:49,597 --> 01:14:52,725
This means that you can eat now.

1222
01:14:52,809 --> 01:14:54,102
Yes, let's eat.

1223
01:14:56,646 --> 01:14:59,232
No metastasis found
in your chest, brain, and bones.

1224
01:14:59,315 --> 01:15:01,067
Everything looks good,
which is amazing news.

1225
01:15:01,150 --> 01:15:04,028
Now, we can just perform the surgery
as planned.

1226
01:15:04,112 --> 01:15:07,323
It's small,
and we found it at an early stage.

1227
01:15:07,407 --> 01:15:09,993
So keep up with the treatment
after the surgery, and you'll be fine.

1228
01:15:10,076 --> 01:15:12,412
-Thank you, Doctor.
-Thank you.

1229
01:15:12,495 --> 01:15:14,831
-Thank you so much.
-My gosh.

1230
01:15:14,914 --> 01:15:17,333
-Dad, let's eat something.
-Okay, sounds good.

1231
01:15:17,750 --> 01:15:19,711
Dad, this is such great news.

1232
01:15:27,510 --> 01:15:28,761
Am I the only one who's eating?

1233
01:15:29,012 --> 01:15:30,763
-That's right.
-Gosh, congratulations.

1234
01:15:30,847 --> 01:15:33,766
-Thank you.
-I'm so happy for you.

1235
01:15:33,850 --> 01:15:36,060
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1236
01:15:37,228 --> 01:15:38,396
Congratulations.

1237
01:15:38,479 --> 01:15:40,565
My gosh, thank you.

1238
01:15:40,648 --> 01:15:43,026
Keep up with the treatment,
and you'll recover in no time.

1239
01:15:43,109 --> 01:15:46,487
Yes, thank you. Thank you so much.

1240
01:15:46,571 --> 01:15:50,450
Oh, have you called
your insurance company? I'll show you.

1241
01:15:50,533 --> 01:15:51,826
Thank you.

1242
01:15:51,909 --> 01:15:54,203
He's become much more cheerful

1243
01:15:54,287 --> 01:15:56,581
after he moved to this ward.

1244
01:15:56,664 --> 01:15:59,459
Thank you all for your help.

1245
01:16:00,251 --> 01:16:03,171
-Thank you.
-Gosh, we didn't even do anything.

1246
01:16:03,254 --> 01:16:04,714
All we did was chat with him.

1247
01:16:05,298 --> 01:16:06,466
That's not true.

1248
01:16:07,050 --> 01:16:09,927
You kept him company and cheered him up
when we were running around,

1249
01:16:10,303 --> 01:16:12,013
and you helped us stay strong.

1250
01:16:12,639 --> 01:16:15,391
Thanks to you, we were able
to get through the past few days.

1251
01:16:16,100 --> 01:16:17,602
Thank you so much, all of you.

1252
01:16:18,853 --> 01:16:20,688
-Thank you.
-Then let's have a party!

1253
01:16:20,772 --> 01:16:22,482
-Yes!
-Yes! A party sounds great!

1254
01:16:22,565 --> 01:16:25,443
-Let's do it.
-Let's party!

1255
01:16:25,526 --> 01:16:26,694
-Let's do it!
-Yes!

1256
01:16:29,906 --> 01:16:32,241
My gosh, it's such great news.

1257
01:16:32,742 --> 01:16:34,035
-Honey.
-Yes.

1258
01:16:34,118 --> 01:16:36,454
Give the doctors something to drink.

1259
01:16:36,537 --> 01:16:37,914
Oh, okay.

1260
01:16:37,997 --> 01:16:40,625
It's all right. No need.
We're not thirsty.

1261
01:16:42,043 --> 01:16:44,754
You must've been in a lot of pain
yesterday. How are you feeling now?

1262
01:16:45,338 --> 01:16:46,381
I feel fine.

1263
01:16:47,340 --> 01:16:48,800
Much better than yesterday, for sure.

1264
01:16:50,843 --> 01:16:53,346
Doctor, thank you.

1265
01:16:54,472 --> 01:16:56,057
For saving me and my baby.

1266
01:16:57,392 --> 01:16:59,352
Don't thank me.

1267
01:16:59,602 --> 01:17:01,729
You should thank Dr. Chu Min-ha here.

1268
01:17:06,609 --> 01:17:07,777
Dr. Chu.

1269
01:17:09,278 --> 01:17:10,238
Thank you.

1270
01:17:12,532 --> 01:17:14,659
I was such a handful, wasn't I?

1271
01:17:16,035 --> 01:17:18,037
I'm sorry. I'm usually not like that.

1272
01:17:20,623 --> 01:17:21,666
I'm really sorry.

1273
01:17:22,166 --> 01:17:23,251
No, it's okay.

1274
01:17:25,128 --> 01:17:26,921
I completely understand.

1275
01:17:28,840 --> 01:17:30,550
I would've been the same way.

1276
01:17:38,433 --> 01:17:43,813
I'm so glad that both you
and your baby are okay.

1277
01:17:46,315 --> 01:17:47,817
I'm very grateful.

1278
01:17:54,115 --> 01:17:55,032
Thank you.

1279
01:17:58,119 --> 01:18:00,163
Don't cry.

1280
01:18:39,118 --> 01:18:40,369
Hello.

1281
01:18:40,745 --> 01:18:42,330
Yes, hello.

1282
01:18:50,505 --> 01:18:52,507
You're going home early today.

1283
01:18:53,216 --> 01:18:55,635
Yes, I have plans this evening.

1284
01:18:57,261 --> 01:18:58,596
With Dr. Chu Min-ha?

1285
01:18:59,430 --> 01:19:00,306
No.

1286
01:19:09,315 --> 01:19:10,316
I'll be off, then.

1287
01:19:32,255 --> 01:19:33,381
-Hi, Andrea.
-Hi, Andrea.

1288
01:19:35,091 --> 01:19:36,551
Did you see an angel or something?

1289
01:19:37,343 --> 01:19:39,679
Gosh, why are you all spaced out?

1290
01:19:40,012 --> 01:19:41,222
It's cold. Get in.

1291
01:19:41,889 --> 01:19:42,723
Okay.

1292
01:19:46,853 --> 01:19:48,062
<i>"He has cancer."</i>

1293
01:19:48,729 --> 01:19:51,190
As soon as I said that,
his whole family just froze.

1294
01:19:52,608 --> 01:19:55,027
His family must've felt like
their whole world was collapsing.

1295
01:19:55,570 --> 01:19:57,530
It's something you think
you'd only hear in dramas.

1296
01:19:58,489 --> 01:20:01,617
But it didn't spread,
so his family is having a party tonight.

1297
01:20:01,701 --> 01:20:02,618
My gosh, really?

1298
01:20:02,702 --> 01:20:04,871
Yes, with other patients in the ward
and their families.

1299
01:20:05,162 --> 01:20:06,330
Before his surgery?

1300
01:20:06,414 --> 01:20:07,248
Yes.

1301
01:20:07,957 --> 01:20:10,418
What a happy family. I envy them.

1302
01:20:10,501 --> 01:20:12,253
Yes, they're such a happy family.

1303
01:20:12,336 --> 01:20:15,089
He has two daughters.
But since he checked into the hospital,

1304
01:20:15,172 --> 01:20:18,009
they haven't been going to work
or to the library. My gosh.

1305
01:20:18,092 --> 01:20:21,053
His whole family stopped
doing everything else to look after him.

1306
01:20:21,137 --> 01:20:23,556
Gosh. I mean,
it's unfortunate that he's ill.

1307
01:20:23,639 --> 01:20:25,391
But it's so lovely to see.

1308
01:20:25,474 --> 01:20:27,059
That's how a family should be.

1309
01:20:27,727 --> 01:20:29,896
I rarely call my dad,
but they inspired me to call him.

1310
01:20:29,979 --> 01:20:33,524
I went to see a patient
who's recovering from her C-section,

1311
01:20:33,608 --> 01:20:35,902
and I could just see
how much her husband loves her.

1312
01:20:36,819 --> 01:20:39,780
From the way he was looking at her,
I could tell that he loves her very much.

1313
01:20:40,781 --> 01:20:43,784
Even I felt the warm fuzzies.

1314
01:20:43,868 --> 01:20:45,995
-Get remarried, then.
-Right back at you.

1315
01:20:47,330 --> 01:20:48,456
What about Jun-wan?

1316
01:20:48,539 --> 01:20:50,875
He has plans.
He said we should just do it without him.

1317
01:20:50,958 --> 01:20:54,587
Gosh, he's going crazy about this girl.

1318
01:20:54,670 --> 01:20:56,672
Who is he dating?

1319
01:20:56,756 --> 01:20:58,382
I'd love to meet her.

1320
01:20:58,466 --> 01:21:00,760
With Ik-jun's hand like that

1321
01:21:00,843 --> 01:21:02,136
and Jun-wan bailing on us,

1322
01:21:02,219 --> 01:21:03,930
why don't we just practice another time?

1323
01:21:04,013 --> 01:21:05,723
What are you talking about?

1324
01:21:05,806 --> 01:21:07,058
Hey, my fingers are fine.

1325
01:21:07,683 --> 01:21:11,437
Had you not tied them so tight,
it wouldn't have taken this long.

1326
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:13,564
Doctors who go overboard
are always the problem.

1327
01:21:13,648 --> 01:21:14,815
What the hell?

1328
01:21:14,899 --> 01:21:17,109
I got to the wedding 30 minutes late
because of you.

1329
01:21:17,193 --> 01:21:19,362
Why go to a stranger's wedding
to begin with?

1330
01:21:19,445 --> 01:21:20,613
I was late because of you.

1331
01:21:20,696 --> 01:21:22,156
My hand is like this because of you.

1332
01:21:22,239 --> 01:21:24,492
<i>I shouldn't have helped you.
You're banned from my office.</i>

1333
01:21:24,575 --> 01:21:26,619
<i>Jeez, then you're banned
from my office too.</i>

1334
01:21:26,702 --> 01:21:28,287
<i>-Oh, gosh!
-What? What is it?</i>

1335
01:21:28,371 --> 01:21:29,747
<i>-Nothing.
-You little...</i>

1336
01:21:29,830 --> 01:21:31,040
<i>Jeez.</i>

1337
01:21:50,643 --> 01:21:55,022
<i>Around the time
When the stars outside my window</i>

1338
01:21:55,564 --> 01:21:59,694
<i>Start to fade away one by one</i>

1339
01:22:00,653 --> 01:22:03,948
<i>I write a letter to the sky</i>

1340
01:22:04,532 --> 01:22:10,204
<i>You left me for another man</i>

1341
01:22:10,287 --> 01:22:13,958
<i>But I still can't forget you</i>

1342
01:22:14,041 --> 01:22:17,586
<i>So I gather my tears</i>

1343
01:22:19,338 --> 01:22:22,091
<i>And send them to the sky</i>

1344
01:22:22,717 --> 01:22:26,971
<i>Even if you don't love me</i>

1345
01:22:27,555 --> 01:22:30,975
<i>I will lie down by your side</i>

1346
01:22:31,058 --> 01:22:37,523
<i>Whenever you need me</i>

1347
01:22:37,606 --> 01:22:42,111
<i>Because I can't forget you</i>

1348
01:22:42,194 --> 01:22:45,906
<i>I will just keep on loving you</i>

1349
01:22:45,990 --> 01:22:51,328
<i>My darling, I will wait for you</i>

1350
01:22:51,412 --> 01:22:57,960
<i>When my tear-filled letter reaches the sky</i>

1351
01:23:00,713 --> 01:23:06,385
<i>You will come back to me someday</i>

1352
01:23:06,469 --> 01:23:11,307
<i>Back to me</i>

1353
01:23:14,685 --> 01:23:21,484
<i>I believe that you will, with all my tears</i>

1354
01:23:21,567 --> 01:23:22,568
"WITH ALL MY TEARS"

1355
01:23:33,120 --> 01:23:37,500
<i>Even if you don't love me</i>

1356
01:23:37,583 --> 01:23:41,253
<i>I will lie down by your side</i>

1357
01:23:41,337 --> 01:23:47,676
<i>Whenever you need me</i>

1358
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:52,348
<i>Because I can't forget you</i>

1359
01:23:52,431 --> 01:23:56,018
<i>I will just keep on loving you</i>

1360
01:23:56,102 --> 01:24:01,732
<i>My darling, I will wait for you</i>

1361
01:24:01,816 --> 01:24:08,823
<i>When my tear-filled letter reaches the sky</i>

1362
01:24:10,825 --> 01:24:16,455
<i>You will come back to me someday</i>

1363
01:24:16,539 --> 01:24:21,335
<i>Back to me</i>

1364
01:24:23,379 --> 01:24:24,505
Doctor...

1365
01:24:25,673 --> 01:24:31,470
<i>My darling, I will wait for you</i>

1366
01:24:31,554 --> 01:24:38,310
<i>When my tear-filled letter reaches the sky</i>

1367
01:24:40,396 --> 01:24:46,110
<i>You will come back to me someday</i>

1368
01:24:46,193 --> 01:24:50,948
<i>Back to me</i>

1369
01:24:54,618 --> 01:24:58,247
<i>I believe that you will</i>

1370
01:25:00,499 --> 01:25:03,252
<i>With all my tears</i>

1371
01:25:20,978 --> 01:25:23,022
What is your name?

1372
01:25:24,440 --> 01:25:26,650
<i>Have you been experiencing
dizziness or vomiting?</i>

1373
01:25:27,735 --> 01:25:29,778
<i>How's your vision?</i>

1374
01:25:35,451 --> 01:25:36,827
-Let's move the patient.
-Okay.

1375
01:25:40,164 --> 01:25:42,291
How are you feeling?

1376
01:25:42,625 --> 01:25:43,626
Stay with us.

1377
01:26:31,671 --> 01:26:37,933
Subtitle translation by Liya Choi

1378
01:26:53,946 --> 01:26:56,573
<i>I practically begged her on my knees,
in tears.</i>

1379
01:26:56,657 --> 01:26:58,993
<i>I said we should be happy
even if we just had one day left to live.</i>

1380
01:26:59,076 --> 01:27:01,370
<i>The situation was critical,</i>

1381
01:27:01,453 --> 01:27:03,872
so it's still too early to tell.

1382
01:27:04,039 --> 01:27:05,624
<i>Let's wait and see.</i>

1383
01:27:06,125 --> 01:27:07,376
<i>I'm so worried.</i>

1384
01:27:08,168 --> 01:27:10,796
<i>Mr. Ju has been diagnosed
with early-stage depression.</i>

1385
01:27:10,879 --> 01:27:12,047
What?

1386
01:27:12,131 --> 01:27:14,633
<i>I think he collapsed
due to ICH in the cerebellum.</i>

1387
01:27:14,717 --> 01:27:16,218
Hey, are you all right?

1388
01:27:18,053 --> 01:27:19,263
What's the matter?

1389
01:27:19,763 --> 01:27:22,599
<i>-What?
-The situation isn't looking good at all.</i>

1390
01:27:22,683 --> 01:27:24,101
<i>What do we do? We don't have time.</i>

1391
01:27:24,184 --> 01:27:25,102
<i>It's my fault.</i>

1392
01:27:25,185 --> 01:27:28,147
I'll take care of it, no matter what.

1393
01:27:29,023 --> 01:27:30,858
<i>It's raining. Shall we go for a drive?</i>

1394
01:27:30,941 --> 01:27:32,985
<i>You said you have plans this evening.</i>

1395
01:27:33,068 --> 01:27:34,695
I guess you have no interest
in getting married.

1396
01:27:34,778 --> 01:27:36,947
The guy kept asking her to marry him,

1397
01:27:37,031 --> 01:27:39,867
and Ik-sun liked him enough
to change her mind about it.

1398
01:27:39,950 --> 01:27:42,828
You know that talking about this
is pointless, right?

1399
01:27:42,911 --> 01:27:44,163
What will happen to us?

1400
01:27:45,164 --> 01:27:46,373
Oh, Gyeo-ul is here.

1401
01:27:47,124 --> 01:27:48,292
<i>He lied to you,</i>

1402
01:27:48,375 --> 01:27:50,961
<i>and he's always so cold to you.
You still like him?</i>

1403
01:27:51,045 --> 01:27:53,589
<i>Just one month. In a month,</i>

1404
01:27:53,672 --> 01:27:55,049
<i>it'll be all over for good.</i>
