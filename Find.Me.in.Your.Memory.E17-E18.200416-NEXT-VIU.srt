<b>(Episode 17)</b>

2
00:00:21,586 --> 00:00:23,656
<b>- Hello?
- It's me.</b>

3
00:00:26,397 --> 00:00:27,766
<b>You know me, don't you?</b>

4
00:00:28,937 --> 00:00:30,037
<b>How did you find...</b>

5
00:00:32,607 --> 00:00:33,807
<b>Where are you right now?</b>

6
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:37,476
<b>Where else would I be?</b>

7
00:00:37,577 --> 00:00:39,747
<b>I'm locked up.</b>

8
00:00:41,577 --> 00:00:44,476
<b>Do you know how much I had to spend
to make one phone call?</b>

9
00:00:44,777 --> 00:00:46,016
<b>Why are you suddenly calling me?</b>

10
00:00:47,546 --> 00:00:49,616
<b>Are you with her right now?</b>

11
00:00:50,586 --> 00:00:51,887
<b>Yeo Ha Jin.</b>

12
00:00:53,957 --> 00:00:54,957
<b>What?</b>

13
00:00:57,897 --> 00:00:58,967
<b>Make sure you protect her...</b>

14
00:01:00,166 --> 00:01:01,527
<b>if you don't want to lose her.</b>

15
00:01:09,306 --> 00:01:13,006
<b>That idiot...
He's quite the character.</b>

16
00:01:16,846 --> 00:01:18,376
<b>What are you talking about?</b>

17
00:01:18,986 --> 00:01:20,387
<b>What do you mean,
"he's quite the character"?</b>

18
00:01:21,117 --> 00:01:23,057
<b>How much do you know?</b>

19
00:01:23,357 --> 00:01:25,316
<b>You have too many questions.</b>

20
00:01:25,656 --> 00:01:28,126
<b>You can come and see me
if you're that curious.</b>

21
00:01:28,626 --> 00:01:30,796
<b>You didn't stay long
the last time you came.</b>

22
00:01:31,396 --> 00:01:33,566
<b>Stop talking nonsense
and tell me right now.</b>

23
00:01:33,827 --> 00:01:35,096
<b>Who is he?</b>

24
00:01:35,096 --> 00:01:36,736
<b>Hey, hang up already.</b>

25
00:01:38,066 --> 00:01:39,906
<b>I have to go now.</b>

26
00:01:40,506 --> 00:01:41,607
<b>See you soon.</b>

27
00:01:44,906 --> 00:01:45,906
<b>Thank you.</b>

28
00:01:46,376 --> 00:01:47,376
<b>Hello?</b>

29
00:01:47,906 --> 00:01:48,917
<b>Hello?</b>

30
00:01:58,417 --> 00:02:01,256
<b>(Find Me in Your Memory)</b>

31
00:02:31,187 --> 00:02:32,326
<b>Anchor Lee.</b>

32
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:35,527
<b>Hey.</b>

33
00:02:35,726 --> 00:02:37,856
<b>Why are you out here?
I was going to be there soon.</b>

34
00:02:38,057 --> 00:02:40,066
<b>It's way past a minute.</b>

35
00:02:40,696 --> 00:02:42,397
<b>Who were you on the phone with?</b>

36
00:02:43,267 --> 00:02:44,636
<b>It was for work.</b>

37
00:02:46,106 --> 00:02:48,106
<b>I'm making some honey tea.
Is that all right?</b>

38
00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:49,677
<b>Yes.</b>

39
00:02:50,076 --> 00:02:52,446
<b>Grab a seat. This time,
it'll really take a minute.</b>

40
00:03:02,886 --> 00:03:03,886
<b>Here.</b>

41
00:03:06,326 --> 00:03:07,427
<b>Thank you.</b>

42
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:16,696
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

43
00:03:17,696 --> 00:03:20,066
<b>I talked big
and said you don't have to worry,</b>

44
00:03:20,066 --> 00:03:21,267
<b>but this is all I can do.</b>

45
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:23,506
<b>You don't have to be sorry.</b>

46
00:03:24,136 --> 00:03:26,807
<b>This is what I needed the most
at this moment.</b>

47
00:03:27,677 --> 00:03:28,846
<b>It's perfect.</b>

48
00:03:29,017 --> 00:03:31,376
<b>Warm and sweet.</b>

49
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:35,087
<b>Drink up and lie down again.</b>

50
00:03:35,617 --> 00:03:37,957
<b>You won't be able to fall asleep
if you wake up completely.</b>

51
00:03:44,297 --> 00:03:45,656
<b>Are you leaving?</b>

52
00:03:46,797 --> 00:03:48,126
<b>I'll stay here,</b>

53
00:03:48,367 --> 00:03:50,666
<b>then I'll drop you off at
Ha Kyung's hospital room tomorrow.</b>

54
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:56,036
<b>I told you that I won't go anywhere.</b>

55
00:04:19,196 --> 00:04:20,666
<b>Who was that jerk?</b>

56
00:04:21,597 --> 00:04:23,766
<b>So he knew exactly where we'd be?</b>

57
00:05:06,307 --> 00:05:07,876
<b>What's wrong with you?</b>

58
00:05:08,376 --> 00:05:09,576
<b>Reporter Jo?</b>

59
00:05:12,076 --> 00:05:13,146
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

60
00:05:28,396 --> 00:05:30,766
<b>Why are you still awake?
Are you having trouble sleeping?</b>

61
00:05:32,066 --> 00:05:33,066
<b>Yes.</b>

62
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:39,407
<b>If it's because of me,
I'll close the door.</b>

63
00:05:43,146 --> 00:05:46,086
<b>No, don't.
I think I'll be even more scared.</b>

64
00:05:50,417 --> 00:05:51,516
<b>Could you just...</b>

65
00:05:52,357 --> 00:05:54,326
<b>chat with me for a bit?</b>

66
00:05:54,787 --> 00:05:56,557
<b>I think that'll help me go to bed.</b>

67
00:06:00,167 --> 00:06:01,227
<b>Sure.</b>

68
00:06:09,807 --> 00:06:11,006
<b>What should we talk about?</b>

69
00:06:12,336 --> 00:06:15,047
<b>It would be nice to chat
about simple things...</b>

70
00:06:15,307 --> 00:06:18,776
<b>such as your interests and hobbies.</b>

71
00:06:19,646 --> 00:06:21,446
<b>But you have neither.</b>

72
00:06:26,826 --> 00:06:30,256
<b>Did you always want to become
a news anchor?</b>

73
00:06:31,896 --> 00:06:33,266
<b>When I was little,</b>

74
00:06:35,526 --> 00:06:38,097
<b>I wanted to become a writer
like my mother.</b>

75
00:06:41,566 --> 00:06:43,836
<b>But I had no talent
and had to give up.</b>

76
00:06:45,407 --> 00:06:48,576
<b>After I matured,
I wanted to become a reporter.</b>

77
00:06:49,716 --> 00:06:51,247
<b>Your dream came true.</b>

78
00:06:52,847 --> 00:06:54,716
<b>Did you become a reporter...</b>

79
00:06:55,417 --> 00:06:57,316
<b>to make a righteous society?</b>

80
00:06:58,016 --> 00:07:00,157
<b>No, I didn't have
such a grand dream.</b>

81
00:07:01,687 --> 00:07:02,756
<b>I was upset.</b>

82
00:07:03,526 --> 00:07:06,196
<b>People would go back
on their words...</b>

83
00:07:06,196 --> 00:07:07,566
<b>and lie.</b>

84
00:07:08,566 --> 00:07:11,537
<b>I was upset that they didn't
even feel guilty.</b>

85
00:07:14,737 --> 00:07:17,776
<b>Don't get me wrong. I didn't become
a reporter to vent on them.</b>

86
00:07:18,977 --> 00:07:21,747
<b>I just wanted the public
to know the truth.</b>

87
00:07:23,816 --> 00:07:25,816
<b>I bet you can easily see...</b>

88
00:07:26,716 --> 00:07:30,487
<b>how selfish and full of lies
people can be.</b>

89
00:07:31,586 --> 00:07:33,086
<b>That must be painful.</b>

90
00:07:35,287 --> 00:07:37,026
<b>What do you like?</b>

91
00:07:37,956 --> 00:07:39,227
<b>Me?</b>

92
00:07:41,826 --> 00:07:44,696
<b>I already told you that
I enjoyed taking pictures.</b>

93
00:07:45,696 --> 00:07:49,437
<b>I like working out and shopping.</b>

94
00:07:49,776 --> 00:07:54,146
<b>I also like listening to music
and watching movies.</b>

95
00:07:54,776 --> 00:07:58,446
<b>I enjoy reading as well,
but I like eating the most.</b>

96
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:01,847
<b>Why are you laughing?</b>

97
00:08:01,847 --> 00:08:04,917
<b>I think I asked you
the wrong question.</b>

98
00:08:06,687 --> 00:08:08,357
<b>There might be no end to this.</b>

99
00:08:09,456 --> 00:08:11,896
<b>You could be right.
I do like many things.</b>

100
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:19,367
<b>I like seeing you smile.</b>

101
00:08:24,276 --> 00:08:27,807
<b>I know I shouldn't feel this way
in this given situation.</b>

102
00:08:29,276 --> 00:08:30,617
<b>But I like this moment.</b>

103
00:08:32,146 --> 00:08:34,886
<b>I like that it's just you and me.</b>

104
00:08:52,236 --> 00:08:54,437
<b>I thought you were injured,
but you look just fine.</b>

105
00:08:54,537 --> 00:08:57,407
<b>By the way, why did you
open the door so suddenly?</b>

106
00:08:58,507 --> 00:09:00,677
<b>I was going to kill you
if you were the stalker.</b>

107
00:09:02,507 --> 00:09:03,917
<b>What brings you here?</b>

108
00:09:04,047 --> 00:09:05,116
<b>I just wanted to visit you.</b>

109
00:09:05,816 --> 00:09:07,187
<b>I thought you'd be bored.</b>

110
00:09:07,616 --> 00:09:09,716
<b>I was hospitalized once
when I was young.</b>

111
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:12,387
<b>I was bored to death.
That's why I came.</b>

112
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:14,627
<b>Your presence alone
won't be entertaining.</b>

113
00:09:14,627 --> 00:09:16,996
<b>That's exactly why
I've prepared some stuff.</b>

114
00:09:20,397 --> 00:09:21,527
<b>What is all this?</b>

115
00:09:22,267 --> 00:09:23,297
<b>Ta-da.</b>

116
00:09:23,297 --> 00:09:25,096
<b>Are we going to play games
while having snacks?</b>

117
00:09:25,437 --> 00:09:27,937
<b>Come on. Just wait there.</b>

118
00:09:32,877 --> 00:09:35,106
<b>Watching movies is the best way
to kill time.</b>

119
00:09:36,677 --> 00:09:38,816
<b>You pretty much have the VVIP seat.</b>

120
00:09:39,446 --> 00:09:40,517
<b>Sit down.</b>

121
00:09:51,096 --> 00:09:54,297
<b>This one looks interesting.
It'll help relieve stress.</b>

122
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:55,527
<b>What movie is it?</b>

123
00:09:58,267 --> 00:10:02,836
<b>I'm not sure. I don't think
this is suitable for a patient.</b>

124
00:10:03,206 --> 00:10:06,346
<b>Let's watch a comedy
so that we can laugh...</b>

125
00:10:06,346 --> 00:10:09,307
<b>No, this looks really fun.
Let me raise the volume.</b>

126
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:12,677
<b>Don't tell me you can't watch
scary movies.</b>

127
00:10:13,147 --> 00:10:15,346
<b>I love horror movies.</b>

128
00:10:15,346 --> 00:10:17,887
<b>I enjoy getting scared.</b>

129
00:10:43,446 --> 00:10:45,116
<b>Gosh, my hair's a mess.</b>

130
00:10:51,287 --> 00:10:52,456
<b>Hey.</b>

131
00:10:53,757 --> 00:10:58,096
<b>Where are you going?
You should play with me.</b>

132
00:11:03,736 --> 00:11:05,236
<b>What is it?</b>

133
00:11:05,937 --> 00:11:07,736
<b>What are you doing down there?</b>

134
00:11:07,836 --> 00:11:11,336
<b>I was picking up the remote control.
Why did you throw it?</b>

135
00:11:12,706 --> 00:11:14,076
<b>You startled me.</b>

136
00:11:14,076 --> 00:11:15,746
<b>You startled me even more.</b>

137
00:11:15,846 --> 00:11:17,177
<b>Your hair's a mess.</b>

138
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,446
<b>My hair tie got loose.</b>

139
00:11:19,746 --> 00:11:23,287
<b>I think this is the first time
I saw you with your hair down.</b>

140
00:11:23,917 --> 00:11:25,787
<b>You're right. I always had it up.</b>

141
00:11:27,356 --> 00:11:29,226
<b>Don't stare at me.
It's uncomfortable.</b>

142
00:11:29,226 --> 00:11:32,527
<b>I mean, you look like a ghost.</b>

143
00:11:33,466 --> 00:11:34,826
<b>But you also look like
you live in the wild.</b>

144
00:11:36,096 --> 00:11:38,137
<b>Anyway, you look better
with your hair up.</b>

145
00:11:38,137 --> 00:11:39,366
<b>You should always tie it.</b>

146
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:43,236
<b>I want to tie it as well,
but my shoulder hurts too much.</b>

147
00:11:45,206 --> 00:11:46,706
<b>Then give that to me.</b>

148
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:47,907
<b>Why?</b>

149
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:49,106
<b>I'll tie it for you.</b>

150
00:11:49,106 --> 00:11:50,677
<b>Forget it.</b>

151
00:11:50,677 --> 00:11:52,846
<b>Why would you tie my hair?</b>

152
00:11:52,846 --> 00:11:54,287
<b>Forget it.</b>

153
00:11:54,517 --> 00:11:57,586
<b>You look too frightening.
I'm good at this.</b>

154
00:11:57,757 --> 00:12:00,387
<b>I used to tie
my younger sister's hair.</b>

155
00:12:14,167 --> 00:12:15,307
<b>Done.</b>

156
00:12:18,407 --> 00:12:20,606
<b>You look so much better.</b>

157
00:12:22,917 --> 00:12:24,277
<b>Don't go.</b>

158
00:12:32,116 --> 00:12:33,157
<b>How did you...</b>

159
00:12:34,586 --> 00:12:36,527
<b>end up here?</b>

160
00:13:05,787 --> 00:13:07,287
<b>Did you sleep well last night?</b>

161
00:13:07,657 --> 00:13:10,027
<b>I didn't even know I fell asleep.</b>

162
00:13:10,027 --> 00:13:12,226
<b>You didn't snore, so don't worry.</b>

163
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:15,326
<b>Did you not have nightmares?</b>

164
00:13:15,996 --> 00:13:16,996
<b>No.</b>

165
00:13:17,767 --> 00:13:20,407
<b>I think the honey water
did the trick. I slept like a baby.</b>

166
00:13:22,037 --> 00:13:23,137
<b>I'm glad.</b>

167
00:13:24,236 --> 00:13:26,946
<b>Are you sure you slept well?</b>

168
00:13:27,246 --> 00:13:29,007
<b>I hope you didn't stay up all night
because of me.</b>

169
00:13:31,047 --> 00:13:32,777
<b>I didn't. I slept well.</b>

170
00:13:33,816 --> 00:13:35,216
<b>I'm glad.</b>

171
00:13:44,456 --> 00:13:46,466
<b>- Hello?
- Are you up?</b>

172
00:13:46,466 --> 00:13:47,596
<b>Yes.</b>

173
00:13:47,596 --> 00:13:49,767
<b>I'm on my way there.
Did you sleep well?</b>

174
00:14:00,106 --> 00:14:01,177
<b>It's freezing.</b>

175
00:14:10,456 --> 00:14:13,157
<b>What? Come on.</b>

176
00:14:13,856 --> 00:14:14,986
<b>Hey.</b>

177
00:14:15,726 --> 00:14:16,757
<b>Hey.</b>

178
00:14:21,797 --> 00:14:24,937
<b>Why is he sleeping here?
He's so weird.</b>

179
00:14:25,397 --> 00:14:28,267
<b>Gosh, it's freezing.</b>

180
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:29,836
<b>It's so cold.</b>

181
00:14:33,177 --> 00:14:37,316
<b>Yes. I slept well. I did.</b>

182
00:14:38,346 --> 00:14:40,616
<b>Yes. Yes.</b>

183
00:14:40,647 --> 00:14:42,316
<b>- Do you need anything?
- What's wrong with you?</b>

184
00:14:42,316 --> 00:14:43,787
<b>No, I don't.</b>

185
00:14:43,816 --> 00:14:45,287
<b>- So where are you?
- I'm almost there.</b>

186
00:14:45,287 --> 00:14:47,057
<b>You're almost here?</b>

187
00:14:47,157 --> 00:14:48,627
<b>I missed my sister.</b>

188
00:14:48,627 --> 00:14:50,657
<b>Yes. Me too.</b>

189
00:14:51,456 --> 00:14:54,196
<b>Hurry. I missed you too. Gosh.</b>

190
00:15:00,307 --> 00:15:01,407
<b>Where are my shoes?</b>

191
00:15:03,206 --> 00:15:04,206
<b>Oh, my gosh.</b>

192
00:15:08,946 --> 00:15:10,446
<b>Ha Kyung, I'm here.</b>

193
00:15:11,216 --> 00:15:12,216
<b>You're here.</b>

194
00:15:12,716 --> 00:15:13,787
<b>Hi.</b>

195
00:15:13,946 --> 00:15:15,216
<b>Mr. Jo?</b>

196
00:15:16,517 --> 00:15:18,216
<b>What brings you here at this hour?</b>

197
00:15:18,557 --> 00:15:20,586
<b>I came to see how she is.
I just got here.</b>

198
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:21,887
<b>He just got here.</b>

199
00:15:23,356 --> 00:15:24,456
<b>I see.</b>

200
00:15:27,996 --> 00:15:29,127
<b>Ms. Yeo Ha Kyung.</b>

201
00:15:29,366 --> 00:15:31,037
<b>The doctor is ready
to tell you the test result.</b>

202
00:15:31,037 --> 00:15:32,236
<b>Okay.</b>

203
00:15:32,437 --> 00:15:34,267
<b>Let me come with you. I'll join her.</b>

204
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:35,267
<b>Okay.</b>

205
00:15:42,277 --> 00:15:43,517
<b>You're not busy today, right?</b>

206
00:15:43,517 --> 00:15:45,147
<b>What? No.</b>

207
00:15:45,147 --> 00:15:48,316
<b>Then, can you drive them
to your place later? Do this for me.</b>

208
00:15:48,316 --> 00:15:50,287
<b>Me? What about you?</b>

209
00:15:50,456 --> 00:15:51,887
<b>I have an important meeting.</b>

210
00:15:52,586 --> 00:15:53,586
<b>Okay.</b>

211
00:15:58,427 --> 00:16:00,527
<b>Are you with her right now?</b>

212
00:16:02,427 --> 00:16:03,537
<b>Yeo Ha Jin.</b>

213
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:08,137
<b>Make sure you protect her...</b>

214
00:16:09,877 --> 00:16:11,307
<b>if you don't want to lose her.</b>

215

<b>(Warden Kim Byung Yoon)</b>

216
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:23,047
<b>Hello, this is Lee Jeong Hoon.</b>

217
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:26,726
<b>I know I'm asking a lot,
but I have a favor to ask you.</b>

218
00:16:29,627 --> 00:16:31,157
<b>My gosh, we're home.</b>

219
00:16:32,057 --> 00:16:33,866
<b>Thank you for driving us here.</b>

220
00:16:33,866 --> 00:16:35,496
<b>Do you want some tea?</b>

221
00:16:35,496 --> 00:16:37,037
<b>What's wrong with them?</b>

222
00:16:37,267 --> 00:16:38,437
<b>They are all shriveled up.</b>

223
00:16:38,437 --> 00:16:41,167
<b>Right. This was your place.</b>

224
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:42,167
<b>Yes.</b>

225
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:44,177
<b>We're treating
the owner like a guest.</b>

226
00:16:44,677 --> 00:16:45,937
<b>I thought they were fake.</b>

227
00:16:45,937 --> 00:16:47,346
<b>They are real plants.</b>

228
00:16:47,346 --> 00:16:49,576
<b>You have to make sure
they get enough sunlight.</b>

229
00:16:50,777 --> 00:16:52,746
<b>Thank you for helping us out.</b>

230
00:16:52,746 --> 00:16:54,486
<b>- No problem.
- Oh, right.</b>

231
00:16:54,486 --> 00:16:57,187
<b>Let's postpone our training
for about a week.</b>

232
00:16:57,187 --> 00:16:58,716
<b>Will that be enough time for you?</b>

233
00:16:58,716 --> 00:17:00,856
<b>I think you should rest up
for a whole month.</b>

234
00:17:00,856 --> 00:17:02,557
<b>A week will be enough.</b>

235
00:17:02,887 --> 00:17:05,527
<b>You should still be careful.
You might not have fully recovered.</b>

236
00:17:05,527 --> 00:17:06,596
<b>Okay.</b>

237
00:17:06,596 --> 00:17:07,866
<b>But what training?</b>

238
00:17:09,167 --> 00:17:13,536
<b>I promised to be
a physical trainer for Mr. Jo.</b>

239
00:17:16,367 --> 00:17:17,437
<b>Why all of a sudden?</b>

240
00:17:17,577 --> 00:17:19,437
<b>That sort of happened.</b>

241
00:17:20,276 --> 00:17:21,347
<b>What is this?</b>

242
00:17:22,577 --> 00:17:25,147
<b>There's something going on
between you two. What is it?</b>

243
00:17:25,147 --> 00:17:26,847
<b>- What is?
- What do you mean?</b>

244
00:17:28,317 --> 00:17:29,786
<b>There's nothing weird about this.</b>

245
00:17:32,687 --> 00:17:35,387
<b>By the way, where did
Anchor Lee go so urgently?</b>

246
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:38,427
<b>My gosh, I don't know.
He doesn't tell me these things.</b>

247
00:17:38,427 --> 00:17:40,397
<b>Is that so?</b>

248
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:55,006
<b>You're here.</b>

249
00:17:55,206 --> 00:17:56,617
<b>You should've hurried.</b>

250
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:58,377
<b>I've been waiting for you
since morning.</b>

251
00:17:59,677 --> 00:18:00,946
<b>Talk now.</b>

252
00:18:01,986 --> 00:18:04,556
<b>- About what?
- Everything you know.</b>

253
00:18:05,157 --> 00:18:06,786
<b>How much do you know?</b>

254
00:18:07,327 --> 00:18:08,556
<b>Who is that jerk?</b>

255
00:18:09,627 --> 00:18:12,696
<b>Oh, you mean Yeo Ha Jin's stalker?</b>

256
00:18:14,466 --> 00:18:15,597
<b>I don't know.</b>

257
00:18:16,097 --> 00:18:18,466
<b>We just exchanged a few letters.
That's all.</b>

258
00:18:19,736 --> 00:18:21,206
<b>- Letters?
- Yes.</b>

259
00:18:21,506 --> 00:18:23,577
<b>He sent me the letters first,</b>

260
00:18:23,677 --> 00:18:25,706
<b>so I just answered
some questions he asked me.</b>

261
00:18:25,706 --> 00:18:27,147
<b>And I asked him some questions too.</b>

262
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:28,177
<b>Right.</b>

263
00:18:28,446 --> 00:18:29,746
<b>And I got some photos as well.</b>

264
00:18:30,917 --> 00:18:31,917
<b>So...</b>

265
00:18:33,617 --> 00:18:34,887
<b>what did you talk about?</b>

266
00:18:37,887 --> 00:18:39,357
<b>Answer me right now.</b>

267
00:18:42,756 --> 00:18:44,857
<b>What kind of reaction is this?</b>

268
00:18:45,427 --> 00:18:47,726
<b>By the way,
are you serious about her?</b>

269
00:18:48,567 --> 00:18:52,536
<b>Do you really like
that woman, Yeo Ha Jin?</b>

270
00:18:52,567 --> 00:18:53,766
<b>Do you?</b>

271
00:18:54,806 --> 00:18:57,437
<b>My gosh, you're one crazy guy.</b>

272
00:18:57,437 --> 00:18:59,407
<b>You're completely out of your mind.</b>

273
00:18:59,407 --> 00:19:00,407
<b>Mr. Lee.</b>

274
00:19:00,907 --> 00:19:02,706
<b>Wake up.</b>

275
00:19:02,976 --> 00:19:06,177
<b>You're the one who should
be locked up here, not me.</b>

276
00:19:06,177 --> 00:19:07,917
<b>Come inside. Let's switch places.</b>

277
00:19:08,417 --> 00:19:09,986
<b>Just answer my question.</b>

278
00:19:12,617 --> 00:19:13,857
<b>You answer mine.</b>

279
00:19:15,486 --> 00:19:17,196
<b>Don't you feel bad for Seo Yeon?</b>

280
00:19:20,026 --> 00:19:21,327
<b>Why can't you answer me?</b>

281
00:19:22,927 --> 00:19:25,167
<b>Don't you feel bad for Seo Yeon?</b>

282
00:19:26,966 --> 00:19:29,567
<b>We could have been happy together
if you didn't get involved.</b>

283
00:19:30,506 --> 00:19:32,637
<b>But you killed Seo Yeon.</b>

284
00:19:33,407 --> 00:19:34,976
<b>And now, what do you think...</b>

285
00:19:36,306 --> 00:19:38,347
<b>you're doing with her friend?</b>

286
00:19:43,456 --> 00:19:45,187
<b>If she sees you like this,</b>

287
00:19:47,026 --> 00:19:49,256
<b>I wonder how Seo Yeon must feel.</b>

288
00:19:54,667 --> 00:19:56,296
<b>Poor Seo Yeon.</b>

289
00:19:59,296 --> 00:20:00,306
<b>Darn it.</b>

290
00:20:11,077 --> 00:20:13,077
<b>Ha Jin. Ha Kyung.</b>

291
00:20:13,216 --> 00:20:14,786
<b>My gosh, what is this about?</b>

292
00:20:14,786 --> 00:20:17,286
<b>It must have hurt so much.</b>

293
00:20:17,286 --> 00:20:18,956
<b>Are you sure it's okay
to get discharged already?</b>

294
00:20:19,117 --> 00:20:22,157
<b>You should get all the treatment
you can at the hospital.</b>

295
00:20:22,157 --> 00:20:24,256
<b>There's nothing to treat here.</b>

296
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:25,597
<b>I'm all better now.</b>

297
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:30,167
<b>After hearing the news,</b>

298
00:20:30,167 --> 00:20:31,637
<b>my hands were shaking.</b>

299
00:20:31,637 --> 00:20:34,167
<b>I don't even know how I drove here.</b>

300
00:20:34,607 --> 00:20:36,206
<b>Ms. Park, let's sit down.</b>

301
00:20:37,337 --> 00:20:39,407
<b>At this rate,
you might faint before we do.</b>

302
00:20:39,407 --> 00:20:41,776
<b>Sit down and calm down.</b>

303
00:20:45,647 --> 00:20:47,687
<b>Ha Jin. Ha Kyung.</b>

304
00:20:47,687 --> 00:20:51,187
<b>Let's officially request the police
to investigate the stalker.</b>

305
00:20:51,456 --> 00:20:53,786
<b>It's not the time to worry
about your image right now.</b>

306
00:20:53,786 --> 00:20:56,087
<b>Who knows
what that jerk would try next?</b>

307
00:20:56,087 --> 00:20:57,927
<b>I agree with you.</b>

308
00:20:57,927 --> 00:21:00,367
<b>On my way here,
I talked to our lawyer.</b>

309
00:21:00,367 --> 00:21:02,266
<b>The lawyer says it's better...</b>

310
00:21:02,266 --> 00:21:05,637
<b>to report the break-in incident
at home and this attack together.</b>

311
00:21:05,637 --> 00:21:07,907
<b>Then, what about the letters
Anchor Lee received?</b>

312
00:21:07,907 --> 00:21:11,337
<b>Those letters will be hard to be

- Look over here too.</b>

463
00:31:15,466 --> 00:31:17,296
<b>- I want to take one too.
- I don't think I'm in the picture.</b>

464
00:31:17,296 --> 00:31:19,106
<b>- I think I'm cut out.
- Exactly.</b>

465
00:31:19,106 --> 00:31:20,766
<b>- I want to be in it too.
- She's so pretty.</b>

466
00:31:21,236 --> 00:31:22,335
<b>She has such a tiny face.</b>

467
00:31:22,335 --> 00:31:24,106
<b>- This is amazing.
- It's awesome.</b>

468
00:31:24,106 --> 00:31:25,106
<b>Good.</b>

469
00:31:25,106 --> 00:31:26,376
<b>Did she get all of us?</b>

470
00:31:27,746 --> 00:31:28,915
<b>Looks great.</b>

471
00:31:28,915 --> 00:31:31,115
<b>- I love you.
- Ha Jin.</b>

472
00:31:31,115 --> 00:31:33,016
<b>- Take another one!
- You're the best.</b>

473
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:34,886
<b>- It looks so great!
- What about me?</b>

474
00:31:34,886 --> 00:31:36,186
<b>Look, doesn't it look great?</b>

475
00:31:36,186 --> 00:31:39,085
<b>- It looks great.
- We look great.</b>

476
00:31:39,085 --> 00:31:41,256
<b>- My gosh, that's so good.
- You look so pretty.</b>

477
00:31:41,256 --> 00:31:42,895
<b>- That's Ha Jin.
- Hey.</b>

478
00:31:42,895 --> 00:31:44,895
<b>- What is this?
- Who is this guy?</b>

479
00:31:44,895 --> 00:31:46,066
<b>- Go away, man.
- You're so pretty.</b>

480
00:31:46,066 --> 00:31:48,726
<b>- Excuse me, everyone. Move aside.
- You have our support.</b>

481
00:31:49,435 --> 00:31:51,835
<b>I'm a huge fan.
May I take a picture with you?</b>

482
00:31:51,835 --> 00:31:53,465
<b>Haven't we met before?</b>

483
00:31:53,465 --> 00:31:55,106
<b>Goodness, you remember me.</b>

484
00:31:55,106 --> 00:31:57,206
<b>I'm the audio director
for "Lee Jeong Hoon's News Live".</b>

485
00:31:57,206 --> 00:31:59,305
<b>- Oh, we've met before. Hello.
- Hello.</b>

486
00:31:59,305 --> 00:32:01,405
<b>Yes, hello. May we take a picture?</b>

487
00:32:01,405 --> 00:32:03,245
<b>- Of course.
- Hey, man. Go away.</b>

488
00:32:03,245 --> 00:32:05,845
<b>Chul Woong, come on over.
Let's take one together.</b>

489
00:32:06,145 --> 00:32:08,215
<b>No, I'm all right.</b>

490
00:32:08,215 --> 00:32:11,786
<b>I don't like taking pictures,
but if you insist...</b>

491
00:32:11,786 --> 00:32:13,226
<b>Excuse me.</b>

492
00:32:13,226 --> 00:32:15,326
<b>- Come, Chul Woong.
- We're acquainted.</b>

493
00:32:15,726 --> 00:32:18,196
<b>It's an honor
to take a picture with you, Mr. Kim.</b>

494
00:32:18,196 --> 00:32:19,425
<b>- Okay.
- Yes, sure.</b>

495
00:32:19,425 --> 00:32:20,666
<b>Okay, let's take it.</b>

496
00:32:20,666 --> 00:32:22,266
<b>- In 1, 2, 3.
- In 1, 2, 3.</b>

497
00:32:31,206 --> 00:32:33,845
<b>Hey, hey. We need to talk.</b>

498
00:32:33,845 --> 00:32:35,175
<b>About what?</b>

499
00:32:35,175 --> 00:32:37,275
<b>There's something.
Come up to the rooftop with me.</b>

500
00:32:37,275 --> 00:32:41,115
<b>Wait, no. You can tell me here.
Why do we need to go up there?</b>

501
00:32:44,516 --> 00:32:47,585
<b>Mr. Kim, why are you here?</b>

502
00:32:47,585 --> 00:32:50,756
<b>You never know.
I set them up like this.</b>

503
00:32:50,756 --> 00:32:52,766
<b>I can't let anything happen.</b>

504
00:32:53,425 --> 00:32:55,766
<b>You won't have to worry about that.</b>

505
00:32:55,766 --> 00:32:56,965
<b>We can handle this.</b>

506
00:32:56,965 --> 00:33:00,006
<b>Come on.
I used to be a good athlete.</b>

507
00:33:00,465 --> 00:33:02,036
<b>Oh, sure.</b>

508
00:33:02,036 --> 00:33:05,236
<b>It seemed like
Ha Jin has a lot of fans.</b>

509
00:33:06,576 --> 00:33:08,275
<b>I'm one of them.</b>

510
00:33:08,576 --> 00:33:09,946
<b>Sure, thanks.</b>

511
00:33:11,875 --> 00:33:14,715
<b>I just received a call
from the police.</b>

512
00:33:15,145 --> 00:33:17,286
<b>They said Reporter Park Soo Chang
turned himself in.</b>

513
00:33:18,155 --> 00:33:20,625
<b>He gave the stalker my photos
in return for money.</b>

514
00:33:22,185 --> 00:33:23,196
<b>Right.</b>

515
00:33:24,155 --> 00:33:26,296
<b>You helped out, didn't you?</b>

516
00:33:27,266 --> 00:33:29,536
<b>You were investigating it.</b>

517
00:33:30,036 --> 00:33:32,835
<b>Reporter Park isn't the type
to turn himself in like that.</b>

518
00:33:33,066 --> 00:33:34,636
<b>I'm sorry I couldn't tell you
in advance.</b>

519
00:33:35,365 --> 00:33:37,206
<b>I had to sort some stuff out.</b>

520
00:33:39,145 --> 00:33:40,805
<b>You've become strange these days.</b>

521
00:33:41,546 --> 00:33:44,316
<b>You're helping me out a lot
these days,</b>

522
00:33:44,316 --> 00:33:46,645
<b>but you keep apologizing.</b>

523
00:33:47,145 --> 00:33:50,585
<b>There's nothing to be sorry about,
so don't say that ever again.</b>

524
00:33:50,756 --> 00:33:52,985
<b>I should charge you 50 dollars
every time you apologize.</b>

525
00:33:54,225 --> 00:33:57,025
<b>Better yet, you should grant me
a wish.</b>

526
00:33:57,295 --> 00:33:59,965
<b>Whoever apologizes first will grant
the other person's wish.</b>

527
00:34:00,996 --> 00:34:03,266
<b>Fine, I won't apologize ever again.</b>

528
00:34:03,436 --> 00:34:07,465
<b>Darn it. What a disappointment.
I already thought of a wish.</b>

529
00:34:12,136 --> 00:34:14,345
<b>- Here.
- Thank you.</b>

530
00:34:15,345 --> 00:34:16,475
<b>Oh, right.</b>

531
00:34:17,715 --> 00:34:19,746
<b>- Here you go.
- Thanks.</b>

532
00:34:20,845 --> 00:34:23,056
<b>Jeong Hoon's not up to anything,
is he?</b>

533
00:34:23,056 --> 00:34:27,985
<b>No. The last time they met,
he had asked Tae Eun for help.</b>

534
00:34:28,725 --> 00:34:30,056
<b>He's still incarcerated, right?</b>

535
00:34:30,855 --> 00:34:32,366
<b>How's Moon Seong Ho doing?</b>

536
00:34:34,595 --> 00:34:37,136
<b>It's a bit strange.</b>

537
00:34:37,136 --> 00:34:38,965
<b>What do you mean?</b>

538
00:34:39,066 --> 00:34:41,735
<b>Last time, when he met
with Anchor Lee,</b>

539
00:34:41,866 --> 00:34:43,775
<b>he became very agitated.</b>

540
00:34:44,636 --> 00:34:47,345
<b>But we had expected that.</b>

541
00:34:47,545 --> 00:34:49,545
<b>But this time,</b>

542
00:34:50,076 --> 00:34:52,845
<b>he looks even calmer than usual.</b>

543
00:34:53,446 --> 00:34:55,045
<b>"Calmer"?</b>

544
00:34:55,045 --> 00:34:59,626
<b>Yes. So we're keeping an eye on him.</b>

545
00:34:59,785 --> 00:35:02,525
<b>But we haven't spotted
anything unusual.</b>

546
00:35:02,525 --> 00:35:03,525
<b>I see.</b>

547
00:35:03,826 --> 00:35:07,095
<b>Can you please tell me
what this is regarding?</b>

548
00:35:07,895 --> 00:35:08,926
<b>Later.</b>

549
00:35:09,965 --> 00:35:11,835
<b>I'll tell you
once it's all finished.</b>

550
00:35:20,706 --> 00:35:21,706
<b>(Records)</b>

551
00:35:28,645 --> 00:35:32,085
<b>(Voice Record
of Inmate Moon Seong Ho)</b>

552
00:35:33,926 --> 00:35:35,126
<b>Tell me.</b>

553
00:35:36,725 --> 00:35:37,725
<b>About what?</b>

554
00:35:37,725 --> 00:35:39,326
<b>About everything you know.</b>

555
00:35:42,665 --> 00:35:46,206
<b>(Inmate Moon Seong Ho, Visitation,
Tell me.)</b>

556
00:35:46,206 --> 00:35:47,806
<b>(What?)</b>

557
00:35:48,735 --> 00:35:51,235
<b>- Hello.
- Hello.</b>

558
00:35:51,405 --> 00:35:52,775
<b>- Hi.
- Hello.</b>

559
00:35:52,775 --> 00:35:54,105
<b>The flowers are pretty.</b>

560
00:35:54,405 --> 00:35:55,405
<b>Father.</b>

561
00:35:56,475 --> 00:35:57,475
<b>Hey.</b>

562
00:35:58,246 --> 00:35:59,645
<b>How was the conference?</b>

563
00:35:59,645 --> 00:36:02,456
<b>It went well. Prof. Park said hi.</b>

564
00:36:02,456 --> 00:36:05,285
<b>I heard you haven't been
showing up to the gatherings.</b>

565
00:36:05,285 --> 00:36:09,256
<b>I have many lectures
and some stuff I need to do.</b>

566
00:36:09,355 --> 00:36:11,655
<b>I see.
Don't overwork yourself, though.</b>

567
00:36:11,655 --> 00:36:13,566
<b>I wanted to ask you something.</b>

568
00:36:14,326 --> 00:36:15,936
<b>It's about Jeong Hoon.</b>

569
00:36:16,535 --> 00:36:17,566
<b>Okay.</b>

570
00:36:17,566 --> 00:36:20,206
<b>Is he visiting
the National Forensic Hospital...</b>

571
00:36:20,206 --> 00:36:23,235
<b>because of that woman, Yeo Ha Jin?</b>

572
00:36:23,436 --> 00:36:24,706
<b>I read the articles.</b>

573
00:36:25,335 --> 00:36:27,845
<b>I heard the stalker
has been threatening her.</b>

574
00:36:28,405 --> 00:36:30,215
<b>Moon Seong Ho is incarcerated.</b>

575
00:36:30,215 --> 00:36:32,485
<b>There's no way he's involved
in what's been happening.</b>

576
00:36:32,485 --> 00:36:33,886
<b>If that's the case,</b>

577
00:36:33,886 --> 00:36:36,256
<b>it's even stranger
for him to go there.</b>

578
00:36:36,256 --> 00:36:38,585
<b>I heard he begged you for help.</b>

579
00:36:38,585 --> 00:36:39,926
<b>I don't know anything about this.</b>

580
00:36:40,556 --> 00:36:42,826
<b>And even if I did,
I wouldn't be able to tell you.</b>

581
00:36:42,926 --> 00:36:44,326
<b>Why not?</b>

582
00:36:44,326 --> 00:36:46,126
<b>This is his privacy.</b>

583
00:36:46,866 --> 00:36:50,535
<b>You don't need to know everything
that's going on with him.</b>

584
00:36:50,535 --> 00:36:52,506
<b>I'm his doctor in charge.</b>

585
00:36:53,605 --> 00:36:55,436
<b>No matter how trivial,</b>

586
00:36:55,436 --> 00:36:57,436
<b>I must know about it
if it's related to his illness.</b>

587
00:36:57,436 --> 00:37:00,145
<b>Jeong Hoon has been doing well.</b>

588
00:37:00,145 --> 00:37:01,446
<b>Why are you being...</b>

589
00:37:04,415 --> 00:37:07,985
<b>Is this regarding something else...</b>

590
00:37:08,345 --> 00:37:10,355
<b>other than his treatment?</b>

591
00:37:11,956 --> 00:37:14,655
<b>Cut that nonsense and let's go eat.</b>

592
00:37:21,126 --> 00:37:23,266
<b>Are you saying it's impossible
to catch the stalker...</b>

593
00:37:23,266 --> 00:37:24,636
<b>with the evidence Reporter Park has?</b>

594
00:37:25,395 --> 00:37:27,535
<b>There is a way.</b>

595
00:37:27,636 --> 00:37:29,576
<b>First, we'll ask the head office...</b>

596
00:37:29,576 --> 00:37:31,936
<b>of the messenger app he used
for the stalker's IP address.</b>

597
00:37:32,235 --> 00:37:34,506
<b>We'll have to track
his cryptocurrency as well. But...</b>

598
00:37:34,506 --> 00:37:36,045
<b>It'll take some time...</b>

599
00:37:36,215 --> 00:37:37,876
<b>since both of the servers
are overseas.</b>

600
00:37:37,876 --> 00:37:39,246
<b>You're correct.</b>

601
00:37:39,246 --> 00:37:40,946
<b>Please hurry.</b>

602
00:37:40,946 --> 00:37:44,016
<b>We're suffocating here.</b>

603
00:37:44,016 --> 00:37:45,186
<b>We will.</b>

604
00:37:45,585 --> 00:37:47,186
<b>Oh, right.</b>

605
00:37:47,655 --> 00:37:49,725
<b>There's something else we found out.</b>

606
00:37:49,895 --> 00:37:51,855
<b>Did anything about him
stand out in particular...</b>

607
00:37:51,926 --> 00:37:53,566
<b>when you talked with him?</b>

608
00:37:54,465 --> 00:37:57,035
<b>Not really. He was always brief.</b>

609
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:00,936
<b>Right.</b>

610
00:38:01,235 --> 00:38:02,605
<b>He did say one thing.</b>

611
00:38:02,936 --> 00:38:04,635
<b>He was looking at the photos
I took of her at a cafe...</b>

612
00:38:04,635 --> 00:38:06,206
<b>and said she looked similar
to when they first met.</b>

613
00:38:06,446 --> 00:38:07,646
<b>"When they first met"?</b>

614
00:38:08,475 --> 00:38:09,646
<b>And when was that?</b>

615
00:38:10,046 --> 00:38:11,615
<b>He didn't go into detail.</b>

616
00:38:12,885 --> 00:38:15,215
<b>Right. He was boasting.</b>

617
00:38:15,215 --> 00:38:18,715
<b>He said he knew her
even before her debut.</b>

618
00:38:18,715 --> 00:38:20,656
<b>That's why she was
even more special to him.</b>

619
00:38:21,286 --> 00:38:24,426
<b>He said he knew me for a long time?</b>

620
00:38:24,625 --> 00:38:27,965
<b>Yes. Can you think of anyone...</b>

621
00:38:28,166 --> 00:38:29,595
<b>in particular?</b>

622
00:38:29,796 --> 00:38:31,296
<b>If he knew her before her debut...</b>

623
00:38:32,735 --> 00:38:34,505
<b>Chul first joined the agency...</b>

624
00:38:34,505 --> 00:38:36,475
<b>when Ha Jin was about to debut.</b>

625
00:38:47,916 --> 00:38:49,186
<b>How may I help you?</b>

626
00:38:49,316 --> 00:38:50,615
<b>Police.</b>

627
00:38:50,615 --> 00:38:53,225
<b>I have a few questions
regarding Ms. Yeo Ha Jin.</b>

628
00:38:53,526 --> 00:38:54,585
<b>Why me?</b>

629
00:38:54,585 --> 00:38:57,026
<b>I heard you were in charge of her
up until not too long ago.</b>

630
00:38:57,755 --> 00:39:00,465
<b>Were there ever times
when you suspected something?</b>

631
00:39:00,465 --> 00:39:01,495
<b>I don't think so.</b>

632
00:39:01,696 --> 00:39:03,566
<b>Nothing really stood out
during my time with her.</b>

633
00:39:04,296 --> 00:39:05,536
<b>I see.</b>

634
00:39:05,536 --> 00:39:09,806
<b>Right, I heard you left work early
last Saturday.</b>

635
00:39:10,406 --> 00:39:11,536
<b>What did you do after work?</b>

636
00:39:12,076 --> 00:39:13,105
<b>Why do you ask?</b>

637
00:39:13,375 --> 00:39:15,745
<b>I'm just following the procedure.</b>

638
00:39:16,515 --> 00:39:19,916
<b>I was stressed out about something,
so I had a drink at my friend's.</b>

639
00:39:20,416 --> 00:39:22,186
<b>I was totally wasted
and blacked out.</b>

640
00:39:22,186 --> 00:39:23,186
<b>I see.</b>

641
00:39:24,385 --> 00:39:28,326
<b>The stalker's motorcycle falls into
one of the higher power classes,</b>

642
00:39:28,326 --> 00:39:31,426
<b>so he needed a type two license
for small vehicles.</b>

643
00:39:32,796 --> 00:39:34,965
<b>Do you have a type two license
for small vehicles?</b>

644
00:39:36,635 --> 00:39:39,635
<b>Yes, I do.
But I rarely ride my bike.</b>

645
00:39:40,735 --> 00:39:44,806
<b>Ever since Ha Jin's debut,
Director Ji Hyun Geun would talk...</b>

646
00:39:44,806 --> 00:39:46,676
<b>about wanting to cast her
for his works.</b>

647
00:39:46,676 --> 00:39:47,706
<b>Didn't the photo turn out great?</b>

648
00:39:47,706 --> 00:39:49,776
<b>Yes, you're right.</b>

649
00:39:50,975 --> 00:39:54,046
<b>Are you and Ms. Yeo close?</b>

650
00:39:54,286 --> 00:39:55,956
<b>Of course. We were practically
stuck to each other...</b>

651
00:39:55,956 --> 00:39:57,485
<b>throughout the movie's filming.</b>

652
00:39:57,585 --> 00:39:59,456
<b>I heard you visited her house...</b>

653
00:39:59,456 --> 00:40:02,385
<b>last Saturday.</b>

654
00:40:02,656 --> 00:40:05,456
<b>May I ask why?</b>

655
00:40:05,456 --> 00:40:06,896
<b>I had a gift for her.</b>

656
00:40:07,926 --> 00:40:09,026
<b>It was that photo.</b>

657
00:40:09,796 --> 00:40:12,095
<b>But I couldn't meet her.</b>

658
00:40:12,706 --> 00:40:13,706
<b>And after that?</b>

659
00:40:14,706 --> 00:40:16,436
<b>I came back here and worked.</b>

660
00:40:16,576 --> 00:40:19,076
<b>I wrote my scenario
and edited some photos.</b>

661
00:40:19,946 --> 00:40:22,505
<b>Was there anyone who saw you?</b>

662
00:40:23,816 --> 00:40:26,385
<b>I like to work alone.</b>

663
00:40:28,215 --> 00:40:31,816
<b>Does this mean
I don't have an alibi?</b>

664
00:40:32,725 --> 00:40:35,585
<b>Not at all. I'm just following
the procedure.</b>

665
00:40:36,896 --> 00:40:39,666
<b>Please call me if you remember
anything in particular.</b>

666
00:40:39,666 --> 00:40:41,396
<b>- Sure.
- Thank you for the coffee.</b>

667
00:40:43,436 --> 00:40:45,265
<b>What was this coffee called?</b>

668
00:40:45,265 --> 00:40:46,536
<b>Chanchamayo.</b>

669
00:40:48,865 --> 00:40:50,975
<b>By the way,
you must enjoy traveling.</b>

670
00:40:51,036 --> 00:40:53,046
<b>You even bought that coffee
while overseas.</b>

671
00:40:54,206 --> 00:40:57,576
<b>It's a lovely place.
You should also visit if you can.</b>

672
00:40:57,715 --> 00:41:01,715
<b>Then you must enjoy
riding motorcycles.</b>

673
00:41:01,916 --> 00:41:04,956
<b>People who enjoy traveling
tend to bike a lot.</b>

674
00:41:04,985 --> 00:41:06,585
<b>I used to bike a long time ago.</b>

675
00:41:06,585 --> 00:41:09,085
<b>But I sold it after finding
another hobby.</b>

676
00:41:09,156 --> 00:41:10,855
<b>Oh, I see.</b>

677
00:41:11,495 --> 00:41:13,625
<b>Thank you for your time.</b>

678
00:41:13,625 --> 00:41:14,965
<b>Not at all.</b>

679
00:41:14,965 --> 00:41:19,095
<b>Sir, please catch the stalker.</b>

680
00:41:19,806 --> 00:41:21,005
<b>I beg you.</b>

681
00:41:22,135 --> 00:41:25,176
<b>Don't you worry about that.
I'll see myself out.</b>

682
00:41:25,176 --> 00:41:27,345
<b>- Okay. Goodbye.
- Goodbye.</b>

683
00:41:42,926 --> 00:41:46,595
<b>I'm really fine.
Don't worry about me.</b>

684
00:41:47,666 --> 00:41:48,765
<b>All right.</b>

685
00:41:48,765 --> 00:41:52,036
<b>They said the stalker
is 1 of those 2.</b>

686
00:41:52,036 --> 00:41:55,036
<b>We'll catch him soon.
Right, Ha Kyung?</b>

687
00:41:55,036 --> 00:41:56,335
<b>Of course.</b>

688
00:41:56,335 --> 00:41:59,306
<b>The detectives said
they'd catch him. Let's trust them.</b>

689
00:41:59,335 --> 00:42:01,446
<b>Let's not worry about it. Let's go.</b>

690
00:42:03,875 --> 00:42:07,245
<b>By the way, what was all that stuff
in the supply room?</b>

691
00:42:07,345 --> 00:42:10,985
<b>Right. You should take them.</b>

692
00:42:11,556 --> 00:42:12,786
<b>- We should?
- Yes.</b>

693
00:42:12,786 --> 00:42:15,456
<b>They're all Ha Jin's birthday gifts.</b>

694
00:42:16,656 --> 00:42:18,625
<b>It's your birthday in two days.
I forgot.</b>

695
00:42:18,625 --> 00:42:19,926
<b>You're right. I forgot as well.</b>

696
00:42:19,926 --> 00:42:23,365
<b>We've been receiving so many gifts.</b>

697
00:42:23,365 --> 00:42:26,066
<b>Gosh, I guess she really made it.</b>

698
00:42:26,066 --> 00:42:27,465
<b>You're right.</b>

699
00:42:28,036 --> 00:42:30,406
<b>What will you do on your birthday?</b>

700
00:42:32,335 --> 00:42:34,206
<b>I should start thinking about that.</b>

701
00:42:44,956 --> 00:42:46,125
<b>Hey, Tae Eun.</b>

702
00:42:47,656 --> 00:42:48,755
<b>Now?</b>

703
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:52,156
<b>What in the world happened
to Ha Jin?</b>

704
00:42:53,796 --> 00:42:54,995
<b>Well...</b>

705
00:42:56,936 --> 00:43:01,105
<b>I had no clue about any of this.</b>

706
00:43:01,865 --> 00:43:03,776
<b>I was too busy to tell you.</b>

707
00:43:04,335 --> 00:43:06,105
<b>Things kept happening.</b>

708
00:43:06,105 --> 00:43:08,546
<b>Is she okay?</b>

709
00:43:09,105 --> 00:43:12,276
<b>You know that she's cheerful
and strong.</b>

710
00:43:13,186 --> 00:43:14,585
<b>She's dealing with it well.</b>

711
00:43:15,485 --> 00:43:16,556
<b>That's a relief.</b>

712
00:43:17,556 --> 00:43:18,615
<b>What about you?</b>

713
00:43:19,456 --> 00:43:20,556
<b>Are you okay?</b>

714
00:43:22,786 --> 00:43:23,956
<b>I'm okay.</b>

715
00:43:25,396 --> 00:43:26,595
<b>Don't worry.</b>

716
00:43:36,835 --> 00:43:39,135
<b>You got so many presents.</b>

717
00:43:39,576 --> 00:43:41,706
<b>My gosh.
We still have more in the car.</b>

718
00:43:42,105 --> 00:43:44,316
<b>How could I forget
about your birthday?</b>

719
00:43:44,446 --> 00:43:46,215
<b>Things are so hectic these days.</b>

720
00:43:46,215 --> 00:43:47,245
<b>Right.</b>

721
00:43:49,046 --> 00:43:51,316
<b>Anchor Lee knows
it's my birthday soon, right?</b>

722
00:43:51,316 --> 00:43:53,156
<b>How would he know your birthday?</b>

723
00:43:53,156 --> 00:43:54,885
<b>He can find my information online.</b>

724
00:43:54,885 --> 00:43:56,225
<b>He must have looked me up
at least once.</b>

725
00:43:56,225 --> 00:43:58,755
<b>Who would look you up online
and memorize your birthday?</b>

726
00:43:58,755 --> 00:44:00,265
<b>Besides, even if he did,
he probably forgot it.</b>

727
00:44:00,265 --> 00:44:01,995
<b>No way. He wouldn't.</b>

728
00:44:01,995 --> 00:44:03,495
<b>Yes, he would.</b>

729
00:44:06,735 --> 00:44:09,436
<b>Don't be disappointed
after your birthday.</b>

730
00:44:09,436 --> 00:44:11,335
<b>You should just
bring that up casually.</b>

731
00:44:20,046 --> 00:44:22,046
<b>You're making me nervous again.</b>

732
00:44:24,456 --> 00:44:27,485
<b>I'm worried you'll say goodbye again
like last time.</b>

733
00:44:28,755 --> 00:44:32,196
<b>That time, you were nice to me
at first and then said...</b>

734
00:44:32,196 --> 00:44:33,896
<b>you didn't want to see me again.</b>

735
00:44:34,566 --> 00:44:37,436
<b>But I'm not going
to listen to you anymore.</b>

736
00:44:38,135 --> 00:44:40,906
<b>You see, I want you to be happy.</b>

737
00:44:41,635 --> 00:44:43,735
<b>That's why I'm not going
to say goodbye.</b>

738
00:45:01,326 --> 00:45:03,196
<b>I enjoyed the news today as always.</b>

739
00:45:03,426 --> 00:45:05,156
<b>Did you get home safely?</b>

740
00:45:05,926 --> 00:45:09,326
<b>Actually, this Wednesday
is my birthday.</b>

741
00:45:09,835 --> 00:45:12,296
<b>Do you have some time to spare
before the news?</b>

742
00:45:12,735 --> 00:45:15,465
<b>I don't need a present.
Just have a meal with me.</b>

743
00:45:27,546 --> 00:45:29,416
<b>You look so pretty
when you're not talking.</b>

744
00:45:29,446 --> 00:45:30,456
<b>Really?</b>

745
00:45:30,656 --> 00:45:32,916
<b>Be quiet. You look so beautiful.</b>

746
00:45:33,456 --> 00:45:34,656
<b>I'll take one for you. Give me that.</b>

747
00:45:34,855 --> 00:45:35,855
<b>Sit down.</b>

748
00:45:37,495 --> 00:45:39,125
<b>Smile.</b>

749
00:45:40,265 --> 00:45:41,926
<b>Nice.</b>

750
00:45:46,365 --> 00:45:47,765
<b>I'll take a photo of them too.</b>

751
00:45:49,676 --> 00:45:51,406
<b>Anchor Lee didn't text back yet?</b>

752
00:45:54,706 --> 00:45:56,345
<b>Why isn't he texting me back?</b>

753
00:45:57,276 --> 00:45:58,475
<b>Is he already sleeping?</b>

754
00:46:30,276 --> 00:46:31,276
<b>Look at this.</b>

755
00:46:32,816 --> 00:46:34,515
<b>Instead of counting
millions of things,</b>

756
00:46:34,515 --> 00:46:36,215
<b>you should only count 5 or 6 things.</b>

757
00:46:37,086 --> 00:46:38,315
<b>What does that mean?</b>

758
00:46:38,315 --> 00:46:40,126
<b>It's saying
we should lead simple lives.</b>

759
00:46:40,285 --> 00:46:43,856
<b>So we can finish calculating things
only by using our two thumbs.</b>

760
00:46:45,555 --> 00:46:46,765
<b>That's cool.</b>

761
00:47:08,586 --> 00:47:09,686
<b>Yeong!</b>

762
00:47:17,656 --> 00:47:18,656
<b>(Courier Service)</b>

763
00:47:23,866 --> 00:47:26,735
<b>Ha Na. Are you all right, Ha Na?</b>

764
00:47:26,735 --> 00:47:29,535
<b>Ha Na. Are you all right?
Are you okay?</b>

765
00:47:29,535 --> 00:47:30,606
<b>Oh, no.</b>

766
00:47:30,606 --> 00:47:31,975

<b>I can't get a hold of her.</b>

921
01:01:35,785 --> 01:01:36,886
<b>She...</b>

922
01:01:37,815 --> 01:01:39,356
<b>She just got abducted.</b>

923
01:01:41,926 --> 01:01:43,025
<b>What?</b>

924
01:02:05,846 --> 01:02:07,715
<b>(We thank Yangpa
for her guest appearance.)</b>

925
01:02:22,465 --> 01:02:24,866
<b>(Find Me in Your Memory)</b>

926
01:02:25,166 --> 01:02:26,495
<b>Did you track her location?</b>

927
01:02:26,495 --> 01:02:27,505
<b>We can't track her.</b>

928
01:02:27,505 --> 01:02:29,636
<b>Do we still have no idea
who did this?</b>

929
01:02:29,636 --> 01:02:31,775
<b>Moon Chul lied about
having a drink with a friend...</b>

930
01:02:31,775 --> 01:02:33,606
<b>on the day
of the motorcycle accident.</b>

931
01:02:33,606 --> 01:02:35,005
<b>Then is he the culprit?</b>

932
01:02:35,005 --> 01:02:36,946
<b>I still have a bad feeling
about Director Ji.</b>

933
01:02:36,946 --> 01:02:39,176
<b>What happened?
Did you track his location?</b>

934
01:02:39,176 --> 01:02:41,285
<b>So you're trying to
work things out with Ha Jin?</b>

935
01:02:41,285 --> 01:02:42,485
<b>I can't let that happen.</b>

936
01:02:42,485 --> 01:02:43,846
<b>Is anybody there?</b>

937
01:02:43,846 --> 01:02:45,785
<b>Ha Jin, wait a little.</b>

938
01:02:46,785 --> 01:02:48,156
<b>Don't come near me!</b>

939
01:02:48,156 --> 01:02:49,926
<b>Who are you, you jerk?</b>

940
01:02:49,926 --> 01:02:52,225
<b>No matter what you do
and how much you try,</b>

941
01:02:52,225 --> 01:02:54,096
<b>you will never lay a finger on her.</b>
