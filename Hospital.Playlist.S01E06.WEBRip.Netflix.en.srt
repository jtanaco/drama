1
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:35,390
Hey, Parking Master!

2
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:41,610
Well... Can you park my bike for me?

3
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,650
Me? "Parking Master"?

4
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:46,910
Why did you turn around, then?
Come on. Take this.

5
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:48,820
Hey, get me some coffee!

6
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:50,990
I'll meet you in the lobby!

7
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,680
Hello, Professor. I'm sorry.

8
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:18,900
Don't be. I'm sorry for waking you up.

9
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:21,270
You have some time before the rounds.

10
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,150
-Get some more sleep.
-No, it's okay.

11
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:32,490
There you are.

12
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:34,410
Is this mine?

13
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,500
When did you get changed?

14
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:41,750
Hey, I can't come out to the lobby
dressed like that.

15
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,460
I also have to do my rounds,
so I went and took care of business

16
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,880
and got changed as fast as I could.

17
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:48,800
Is that so?

18
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:51,140
What you're thinking did not happen.

19
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:53,850
My anal sphincter is still strong.
Goodness.

20
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:55,350
What's this guy doing?

21
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:57,640
He's fast asleep.

22
00:01:57,730 --> 00:02:00,100
Right, I'm exhausted every morning too.

23
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,190
Jeez, you scared me.

24
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:14,450
It's time you said goodbye to this world.

25
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:18,960
Leave everything you have behind

26
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,000
and come with me.

27
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,000
Now?

28
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,460
But I still have a lot to do.

29
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,260
Hey, wake up.

30
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,300
Dr. Yong, you're still alive.

31
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:33,180
-Hey, stop it.
-Seriously?

32
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,010
What the...

33
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:38,270
Dr. Yong, you must be really tired.

34
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:40,980
Have you taken a vacation yet?
You need some rest.

35
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,230
No, not yet.

36
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:47,030
-But I'm taking some time off next month.
-Good.

37
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:52,160
Professor Chae said we should all
take a vacation for a week,

38
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:55,700
so all the residents will take turns
and go on vacation.

39
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:59,200
If I could,
I'd love to take a week off as well.

40
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:03,420
If you had to take a year off
and not work, what would you do?

41
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:06,300
-Me?
-She'll probably want to study.

42
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:07,630
No.

43
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:12,010
I'd move to a place like Gangneung,
Sokcho, or Tongyeong.

44
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:14,600
I'd love to live somewhere like that
just for a year.

45
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:19,470
I want to live in a place that's not
too big or too small just for a year.

46
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,770
I'll work at a hospital there.

47
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:23,100
The question was,
"What would you do if you didn't work?"

48
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:24,860
It'd be more boring
if I don't work at all.

49
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:28,730
No, it wouldn't be boring.
There are so many things you can do.

50
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,780
-Okay, you can play all you want.
-I will!

51
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,410
Anyway, I'd prefer to work
at a small hospital

52
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:35,700
over a big hospital like this,

53
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:37,910
so I can give each patient
undivided attention.

54
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:41,960
There was an MBC documentary
called Success Tale.

55
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:43,330
Gosh, stop it.

56
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:46,080
If that show was still running,

57
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:48,210
they'd produce
a three-episode special feature on her.

58
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:53,430
In my free time, I'll go hiking,
go to the beach, and do fun things.

59
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:56,680
Hospitals in small towns are even busier.
"Free time"? Gosh, I doubt it.

60
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,010
What about you, Professor Lee?
What would you do?

61
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,180
Me?

62
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,140
I've never thought about it.

63
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:06,480
Should I assume I have a kid?

64
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,110
No, let’s say you’re single.

65
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:11,240
Clubbing! I'd go clubbing, of course.

66
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:14,820
I'll go to a club and dance all night.

67
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:19,330
I'll make sure my feet don't touch
the ground for over a second at a time.

68
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:21,120
-Like this.
-What about during the day?

69
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:23,580
I'll go shopping.

70
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:28,420
You see, I'm a city guy.
I love Seoul so much.

71
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,630
Seeing the stars and the moon
in the countryside isn't my thing.

72
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:34,930
The flashing neon signs in the city

73
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:38,970
Those things... How should I put this?
They heal my mind.

74
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:40,720
Aren't you taking flower photos recently?

75
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:42,520
There are flowers at shopping malls.

76
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:45,690
The apartment complexes
are surrounded by flowers.

77
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:50,820
I'd go to the flower shop
by the food court at the department store

78
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:54,320
and take pictures
of the neatly arranged flowers there.

79
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,990
Let's go. It's time for our rounds.

80
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:58,570
Come on. I have to do my rounds too.

81
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:01,870
The glamorous city

82
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:03,080
Gosh, be quiet.

83
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:23,180
I'll give you my answer
within the next 72 hours.

84
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:31,060
Is this some kind of a military
operation? You can take your time.

85
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:37,530
Then give me about a week.

86
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,660
All right. Don't skip meals.

87
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:47,210
Of course!
I eat two bowls of rice for every meal.

88
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:50,630
I'm sorry, Mom.
The baby's condition suddenly worsened.

89
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,540
I have to go to the PICU now.

90
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:55,760
You can go and get
the health checkup done by yourself.

91
00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:01,300
Mom, the gastroscopy
will be done last anyway.

92
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:04,260
I should be able to make it there by then.

93
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:09,350
Of course, I can get it done by myself.
Am I a kid?

94
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,560
But I was told to bring a guardian
for the conscious sedation endoscope.

95
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:14,610
Gosh, what a nuisance.

96
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:16,360
So people who are single
and have no friends

97
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,360
can't even get it done or what?

98
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:22,740
I know that too. That's why I left the car
and took a taxi here. Anyway...

99
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,040
-Excuse me.
-Yes.

100
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:27,700
Where do I go for a health checkup?

101
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:30,420
Go to B1 of the next building.

102
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,630
You can either go outside
and find that building

103
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:35,090
or just head down to B1 from here.
It's all connected.

104
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:37,170
My gosh, you're so kind.

105
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,050
-Thank you.
-No problem.

106
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,760
Whatever. I don't need you.

107
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,720
I'll figure out what to do with
this damn endoscopy, so just do your work.

108
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:46,890
I have to go.

109
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,310
Hey, Jun-wan. Are you seeing someone?

110
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:58,570
You are. Talk to you later.

111
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,740
That prick, is he a psychic?

112
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:13,670
This morning, his temperature went up
to 37.8°C, so we gave him a fever reducer.

113
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,130
The fever has gone down.

114
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:19,670
I saw the chest X-ray you took
this morning.

115
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:23,550
Your lungs are still tight.
That's probably why you had a fever.

116
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,930
It's not easy, but you have
to keep doing the ball exercise.

117
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:32,310
I feel so weak
because all I eat is porridge.

118
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:34,520
You'll get rice starting tomorrow.

119
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,940
We'll give him normal meals
starting tomorrow.

120
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:38,020
Okay.

121
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:40,110
Can I eat meat?

122
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:42,780
I have a huge craving for bulgogi.

123
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,160
Gosh, even now...

124
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:50,250
I feel like I can smell bulgogi right now.

125
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:54,170
The Seoul-style bulgogi, right?

126
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:56,380
With the sweet marinade.

127
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:59,550
With a ton of green onions.

128
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:02,800
Two tablespoons of minced garlic.

129
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:06,930
A little bit of corn syrup and plenty of
enoki and shiitake mushrooms, right?

130
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:09,390
I can smell...

131
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:18,480
Ma'am! You can't give him that.
He's supposed to be fasting now.

132
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:21,780
Gosh, please. My goodness.

133
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:25,070
Your surgery is tomorrow.
You really shouldn't be eating this, sir.

134
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,160
Gosh, Doctor.

135
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,290
It's major surgery
where his abdomen will be split open.

136
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:34,330
He can't go in for the surgery
on an empty stomach.

137
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:38,420
He needs to eat at least one proper meal

138
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,840
for the surgery to go well. Right, Doctor?

139
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:45,050
No. That's not how it works, ma'am. Gosh.

140
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:49,930
Sir, you can eat as much as you want
after the surgery.

141
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:53,230
If you eat this now,
you'll have to fast one more day.

142
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:55,190
Just restrain yourself for today,

143
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:58,650
and you can eat all sorts of yummy foods
until you turn 100. I promise, okay?

144
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:02,230
-Great. I'll put this in the fridge.
-Gosh, all right.

145
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,650
Thank goodness you caught that,
Professor Lee.

146
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:07,610
He's getting his surgery tomorrow.

147
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,870
Doctor, wait! Doctor.

148
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,290
Take this.

149
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,710
My grandson bought it.

150
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:21,250
My gosh, it's sweet and tasty.
It's so good.

151
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:25,800
Ma'am, we can't accept things like this.

152
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,380
This could get us in trouble.

153
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:30,760
Gosh, it's just coffee though.
You really can't accept it?

154
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:33,600
You see, I just...

155
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:37,020
I feel bad
for causing such a nuisance today.

156
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:40,560
That's very sweet of you.
The gesture is more than enough.

157
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:41,860
I'll take it.

158
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:43,690
Thank you.

159
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:47,860
My gosh, it looks delicious.

160
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:51,740
Ma'am, I'll accept it this time,
but don't give me anything from now on.

161
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:55,080
Sure thing. You won't get anything from me
from now on.

162
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:58,080
Enjoy the coffee.

163
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,040
-Thank you for this.
-My pleasure.

164
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:04,380
Ms. Song! Let's go to the VIP ward.

165
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:08,970
Ms. Song and I will go check up
on Mr. Go Yeong-min in the VIP ward.

166
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:11,010
Wait.

167
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:12,760
What?

168
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,390
You can come too.

169
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:21,190
Let's go.

170
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:25,780
-Your kid dropped out of school?
-Yes.

171
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:28,070
The kid really can't stand school.

172
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,990
If the kid doesn't want to go,
you can't really do anything.

173
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:32,160
I mean, what can you do?

174
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:34,030
-Eighth grade, right?
-Yes.

175
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,200
Gosh.

176
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:38,410
I said, "You have
to at least finish middle school."

177
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:40,540
-But the kid wants to take the GED test.
-What?

178
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:43,420
The kid will work part-time
and buy a camera and a computer.

179
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,170
And the kid told me
to mind my own business.

180
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,220
Sometimes I feel like my kid is an alien.

181
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,350
Hello. My gosh.

182
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:58,480
I guess you came here
right after your shoot.

183
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,980
Yes, hello.

184
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:03,440
I was up all night because of the shoot.
I got here a few hours ago.

185
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:07,320
I didn't have a chance
to remove my makeup though.

186
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:10,490
Is your father asleep?

187
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,570
Yes, he just fell asleep.

188
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,580
-Hello.
-Yes, hello.

189
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:17,370
My gosh.

190
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:21,500
Even for simple surgery,
the next day is always the hardest.

191
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:23,670
After today, it'll be much easier,

192
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,750
so please tell him to hang in there.

193
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:28,300
He actually watched TV with me
until he fell asleep.

194
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:30,720
He doesn't feel any pain or discomfort.
He feels great.

195
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:37,390
Well, I should buy you a meal sometime.

196
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:38,720
Sure.

197
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,270
Then how about lunch today?

198
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:43,810
Sounds good.

199
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,820
How are the total bilirubin
and LFT levels?

200
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:55,320
The total bilirubin level is 25,
and LFT is 700 over 400,

201
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:56,950
but it keeps going up.

202
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,870
-Still no word from the KONOS?
-No.

203
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:07,040
I don't think she can hold out
for more than a week.

204
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,300
Gosh.

205
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:14,180
Ji-a's mother is outside, right?

206
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:17,550
Yes, she is. But she's devastated.

207
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:23,560
I explained everything to her.
Often, and in detail.

208
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:26,980
Not like the last time. I wasn't blunt.

209
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,570
Thanks.

210
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:32,360
I'll tell her

211
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:35,280
that Ji-a might have a hard time.

212
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:16,650
You're a big eater now.

213
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:22,120
Back then,
I only ate one meal every two days.

214
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:24,410
-It must've been tough for you.
-Yes.

215
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:26,620
Sorry.

216
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:33,250
Well, is that why you broke up with me?

217
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,630
Me? I didn't say I want
to break up with you.

218
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,300
-Did I say it first?
-Yes.

219
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:42,220
You said you were stressed and tired.
You wanted a break.

220
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:43,930
Then you were off the grid.

221
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:48,600
I did. But when I called you
after a little while,

222
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,610
you ignored my calls.

223
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:53,690
-I called you about 30 times.
-No, you called 29 times.

224
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,740
Good for you. You have a good memory.

225
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,070
I totally made that up.

226
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,450
-Hello, I'm a fan of yours.
-Oh...

227
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:07,040
-Hello, enjoy your lunch.
-Thank you.

228
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:14,380
Are you uncomfortable here?
We should've eaten out.

229
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:17,590
Yes, I said I'd take you
to a nice restaurant.

230
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:20,760
Gosh, don't you know about
the Improper Solicitation and Graft Act?

231
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:23,390
-Hello, Professor Lee.
-Hello, Professor Lee.

232
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:29,980
Aren't you...

233
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:32,860
Yes. She's the person who you think
she is, but she's eating right now.

234
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,070
Go away, guys.

235
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,230
-Enjoy your lunch.
-Thank you.

236
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,740
-Enjoy your lunch.
-Thank you.

237
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:46,620
Would you like anything else?
This kongguksu is good too.

238
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:50,290
My, look who's here. I'm a fan of yours.

239
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,790
Gosh, these pricks.
Can you please let her eat--

240
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:56,460
My gosh.

241
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:58,130
Hello, sir.

242
00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:00,430
Is everything fine, my good sir?

243
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:03,390
-He's the chairman of the hospital board.
-Oh, hello.

244
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:05,810
My gosh, you don't need to get up. Please.

245
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:08,140
You look much prettier in person.

246
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:10,060
My goodness.

247
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:11,480
Are you a doll?

248
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:13,100
Gosh, no.

249
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:16,570
What brings you by?

250
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:18,070
-Are you not feeling well?
-I'm fine.

251
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,110
I came for a checkup.

252
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:22,200
-Is she your patient?
-Well...

253
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:25,410
I performed surgery
on her father yesterday.

254
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,370
Can I take a picture with you?

255
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:30,620
-Sure.
-Let's take a selfie together.

256
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:32,960
Sure, I can take it.

257
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:36,380
Hey, I want to be in the picture too.

258
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:38,590
All right.

259
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:40,920
Here we go.

260
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:49,430
Oh, I was recording a video.
Sorry about that.

261
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:53,440
-Shall I take a picture of all of you?
-No, it's okay. I got this.

262
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:56,480
All right, let's try it again.
Look at the camera.

263
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:03,490
-What are you doing?
-Here. Let's do this.

264
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,330
-Hey.
-This is...

265
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:12,040
Hey, you take it. Goodness.

266
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:13,670
-All right, then.
-Okay, guys.

267
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:19,210
I'll take it now. One, two, three.

268
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:25,390
You're too stubborn.

269
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:28,220
That was embarrassing,
in front of all those people.

270
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,310
What was I supposed to do?
I can't see very well.

271
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:32,730
Hand me your car keys.
I'll drive you home.

272
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:34,730
People become more stubborn as they age.

273
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:36,980
-No wonder youngsters don't like you.
-Come on now.

274
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:39,860
I'm still young at heart.

275
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:41,690
Age is nothing but a number.

276
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:45,110
You need to be youthful physically.
How you feel doesn't matter at all.

277
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,660
Jeez, give me that.

278
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,580
Maybe the battery is dead.

279
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:54,000
Are you sure it's on this floor?

280
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,830
I always park here...

281
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:09,550
I told you.
How you feel doesn't matter at all.

282
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:14,640
Let's move into a nursing home, Jong-su.

283
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:17,100
Do you know of a good one?
Frankly, I'd like that.

284
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:19,400
But first, let's find your car.
Give me that.

285
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:22,030
I took a taxi here today.

286
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:34,250
-Goodness.
-I took a taxi.

287
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,920
-Oh, dear.
-You think it's funny?

288
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,050
Yes, I have to laugh.

289
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:45,420
Goodness. You're too much.

290
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:48,800
Gosh. I get that you were
all over the place today, but how...

291
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:51,430
-Oh, boy.
-I took a taxi here.

292
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,650
MOM

293
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:15,500
Hi, Son. Did you have lunch?

294
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:18,210
No, not yet. I'm going to have lunch now.

295
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:21,880
What's with your voice, Mom?
Do you have a cold?

296
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:25,050
They say even dogs don't catch a cold
in the middle of summer,

297
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:28,170
yet I caught a cold. Poor me.

298
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:31,090
I'm okay though. I took some medicine.

299
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,180
What is it? Did something happen?

300
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:35,010
Oh... No.

301
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:38,100
I'll go to Aunt's place after work.

302
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,730
Yes.

303
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:43,060
I'll head over there now
and eat something.

304
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:44,650
I'll see you later.

305
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:52,910
When did you get here?

306
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:59,290
What's wrong?
Is your patient not doing well?

307
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:01,790
It's a six-month-old baby.

308
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:05,040
We performed the Kasai procedure
three months ago for her biliary atresia.

309
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:06,670
And?

310
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,920
Her condition seemed to be improving
after the surgery,

311
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:12,260
but her hepatocirrhosis
is quite serious now.

312
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:15,930
A liver transplant
would be the only solution.

313
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:19,560
But her mom's blood type isn't compatible,
and her dad has hepatitis B.

314
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,810
Have you registered her yet?

315
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:25,110
It won't be easy to find a donor
as she's a baby.

316
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:28,440
Yes, I already did.
But I haven't heard from them yet.

317
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:32,860
She's an infant, so a brain-dead donor
must be under the age of 40.

318
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:34,660
And the liver can't be too large.

319
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:37,490
It's honestly so difficult.

320
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:43,540
Her parents seem exhausted.

321
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:45,460
I think they've almost given up.

322
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,630
I can't give up though.

323
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:50,970
Oh, boy.

324
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,890
But you should try everything you can do.

325
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,310
Let's go.

326
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:01,350
-Let's go eat something.
-I don't have an appetite.

327
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:11,190
What? A hinoki bathtub?
Why do you need it?

328
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:15,410
Seong-beom who lives next door
got one for his mom?

329
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:17,870
What? Thirty million won?

330
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:23,120
Mom, your son is not rich.
I live paycheck to paycheck.

331
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:24,750
Gosh, seriously!

332
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:27,920
I already spoke to my friend
who's an ENT doctor.

333
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:30,300
Come to the hospital next week.
I'll go with you.

334
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:34,260
You need to get good-quality hearing aids
that fit well.

335
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:38,100
Gosh, I chose a cheap one.

336
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,640
Yes, seriously. It was very cheap.

337
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:44,600
Okay.

338
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,600
Jeong-yeon changed what?

339
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,150
She changed her name? To what?

340
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:52,530
Mom.

341
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:55,530
If she's still only getting minor roles
after 15 years,

342
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:57,070
it means she doesn't have talent.

343
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:00,620
Tell her to quit and learn
a practical skill or prepare for an exam.

344
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:03,160
I'll talk to her.

345
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,330
Okay, I'll call her.

346
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:07,960
-Jeong-yeon changed her name?
-Yes.

347
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:10,500
She's Yeon-jeong now.

348
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,260
-That's a pretty name.
-Pretty, my ass.

349
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:16,180
What a joke.
It sounds like a Chinese restaurant.

350
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:17,090
My gosh.

351
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:20,050
-She's so immature.
-You ordered eggs, right?

352
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:25,140
Your eggs are here. They're fresh and big.

353
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:27,560
You haven't eaten yet, right? I knew it.

354
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:29,360
Here, the lady at the cafeteria
gave me this.

355
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,320
-They're boiled eggs, right?
-Obviously.

356
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:34,900
Professor Chae, the flash drive. Hello.

357
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:37,070
-Yes, I'll take it.
-Here you go.

358
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:39,660
My brother, good to see you.

359
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:41,410
A younger sister's husband
is a brother-in-law.

360
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:43,120
Gosh, no.

361
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,160
Brother-in-law, have a seat here.

362
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:47,000
Are you busy? Sit down for a minute.

363
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:49,670
-I can't. I have to do something.
-Song-hwa.

364
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,670
Is he that busy?
Are you making him work like a dog?

365
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:56,010
Join us and have some food.

366
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:00,930
Yes, have a seat.
I have something to tell you.

367
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:01,930
Okay.

368
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:08,230
Well...

369
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:10,770
You know that you're the first, right?

370
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:13,730
-What do you mean?
-I'm talking about Ik-sun.

371
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:16,650
She's actually quite popular.

372
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,410
When you meet her,

373
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:21,530
you realize that she's funnier
than you thought.

374
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:24,620
Yes, you're right. She's really funny.

375
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,330
I know that very well.

376
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,830
Especially, the pigeon...

377
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:30,960
Right, the pigeon.

378
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:34,340
You must've seen it many times.
I taught her that.

379
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:36,050
You see, I...

380
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:38,510
This is what I do. The pigeon...

381
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:41,760
It flies like this.

382
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,730
Then it comes back like this.

383
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:49,850
I've been seeing that for 20 years.

384
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:52,060
-Gosh, I'm sick of it.
-I've seen his and his sister's.

385
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:54,900
That's why she's had so many guys
confess their feelings to her.

386
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:57,150
I'm telling you. Ik-sun has had

387
00:22:57,230 --> 00:23:00,150
countless guys chase her.

388
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:03,820
Yes, Ik-sun is popular
in the unit as well.

389
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:04,740
Right?

390
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:07,750
She's used to having guys
confess their feelings to her.

391
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:11,500
This is my first time seeing her
being so obvious about liking a guy.

392
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:13,580
Me?

393
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:16,800
Gosh, it's not me.
We don't have that kind of relationship.

394
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:20,050
Seriously, we're just close friends.
She's my best friend.

395
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:22,640
-Really.
-That's how it begins, you know.

396
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,890
Soon, you guys will call each other
"babe" or "honey."

397
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:28,560
Professor Lee, we're really just friends.

398
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:30,060
You see, my sister...

399
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:35,110
She's so used to receiving love.

400
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,650
She's never liked a guy first.

401
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:40,360
Even if she had a crush on someone,
she never showed it.

402
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:42,030
But I think

403
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:45,490
my sister likes you.

404
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:48,990
Dr. Ahn.

405
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,370
I hope

406
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:56,210
you'll accept my sister's love.

407
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:06,050
Are you all right? That must've hurt.

408
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:11,640
-Why did you hit me? What the hell?
-Hey.

409
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:13,100
-Why--
-You prick.

410
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:14,230
-Hey, guys.
-What? Why?

411
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:15,440
-I didn't do anything.
-Stop.

412
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,270
-Who do you think you are?
-How embarrassing.

413
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,610
-What's your problem?
-Guys, enough!

414
00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:21,530
Hey, what the hell?

415
00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:23,280
I brought those eggs.

416
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,910
-How dare you smack my head--
-Seriously!

417
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:39,840
I thought
you guys were seven-year-old boys.

418
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:42,670
Why did you use his head to crack the egg?

419
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,550
Because Ik-jun kept talking nonsense.

420
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:46,300
Why is that nonsense?

421
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:49,760
I've never seen a guy
who knows so much about his sister.

422
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:52,430
He was talking about himself,
not his sister.

423
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:54,390
That's how he's always been.

424
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,270
Have you ever seen Ik-jun
fall for a girl first?

425
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:59,940
He married Hye-jeong
because she chased him for months.

426
00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:03,070
He and his sister
are driving me nuts these days.

427
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:05,700
I'm leaving.

428
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,370
You won't stay for coffee?

429
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:10,370
I have to go see Mr. Instinct.

430
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:13,790
I have a gift for him.

431
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:16,540
Bye.

432
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:23,880
Have you seen Mr. Instinct?

433
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,380
"Mr. Instinct"?

434
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:27,930
Dr. Do stepped out to get coffee.

435
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:29,430
-Should I call him?
-No, no need.

436
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:32,770
He's never around
when I'm trying to be nice.

437
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:34,230
Why, Professor?

438
00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:37,310
I was going to ask him
to take care of an ASD next week.

439
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:40,150
-Shall I call him?
-No, I can call him.

440
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,780
I was going to tell him nonchalantly
and surprise him.

441
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:46,070
I heard he comes here often,
so I came to find him.

442
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:49,320
Too bad. I suppose this is his fate.

443
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,620
Take it easy, guys.

444
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:03,340
What brings you here?

445
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:05,760
Is this Dr. Bong's salon,
where I can find out

446
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,130
everything about the professors
from their first love

447
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:10,180
to their health problems?

448
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:12,430
That's correct.
About Professor Kim Jun-wan?

449
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:13,390
Correct.

450
00:26:13,810 --> 00:26:16,230
I love Professor Kim very much.

451
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:18,190
I want to know more about him.
What should I do?

452
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:20,230
Gosh, I'm so curious.

453
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:24,780
Dr. Ahn, I'm really jealous.

454
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:27,360
Professor Chae is like Mother Teresa.

455
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,450
Yes, she's great.

456
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:31,910
Dr. Ahn, you really don't look like
a military guy.

457
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:33,740
Are you sure
you're from the Military Academy?

458
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:35,830
Yes, I did pretty well in the military.

459
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:37,330
Then why did you leave?

460
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:39,920
You got into Korea Military Academy
and became a captain.

461
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,080
Why did you quit?

462
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:43,590
Rumor has it
that it was because of a woman.

463
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:45,840
I heard he quit because
he lacks the aptitude for it.

464
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:49,130
There was a big accident in his unit.
He quit because of his PTSD.

465
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:51,550
-I'm sure a woman was involved.
-He lacks the aptitude.

466
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,760
He obviously didn't follow
the MBTI test results.

467
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:55,890
It was because
of his post-traumatic stress disorder.

468
00:26:55,970 --> 00:26:57,430
It can be very stressful.

469
00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:01,600
Wouldn't it be more comfortable for you
to talk about this when I'm not around?

470
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:05,520
No, we never talk behind anyone's back.
We say it in front of them.

471
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:09,950
Dr. Ahn, you won't tell us anyway. Right?

472
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,370
Forget it. It's not like we're curious.

473
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:16,580
-All right.
-Also, the past isn't important.

474
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:18,250
The future is what matters.

475
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:19,620
Professor.

476
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:22,830
What does Professor Kim Jun-wan
like the most?

477
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:26,500
I've been observing him
for half a year and...

478
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,050
And?

479
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:30,260
I think he likes everyone but me.

480
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:32,590
He doesn't open up easily.

481
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:36,220
He has no interest in other people.
He's a selfish guy.

482
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:40,390
Oh, there is this one thing.
Golf. He loves golf.

483
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,520
He'd even go golfing
with his parents' worst enemy.

484
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:08,840
As for Jeong-won, he's from a rich family,

485
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:11,300
so he's dabbled in all sorts of things.

486
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:13,300
He has a different hobby for each season.

487
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:14,680
-In spring--
-He runs a marathon.

488
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:17,050
That's right.
He runs a marathon in spring.

489
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,810
In summer, he goes surfing.

490
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:23,270
In autumn, he goes hiking.
Then in winter, he goes skiing.

491
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,270
But he can't do any of that these days
because he's busy.

492
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,440
What about Professor Yang?

493
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:30,940
Seok-hyeong? Does he have a hobby?

494
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:33,320
I think he's always home.

495
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:37,570
Rumor has it that he has a 300-inch TV.

496
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:39,160
Jeez.

497
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:41,910
Song-hwa's only hobby is going camping.

498
00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:08,310
As for Ik-jun...

499
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,150
That prick is...

500
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:13,570
He does everything.

501
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:18,910
He bikes, golfs,
and also likes video games.

502
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:21,660
He can play the guitar
as well as the bass guitar.

503
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:25,620
He even wrote a cheer song
for a baseball team. Also, he can cook.

504
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:30,000
Anyway, he does everything.
And he's good at all of them.

505
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:33,010
-He can cook?
-He sure can.

506
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:36,130
You know
he's been a single father for a few years.

507
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:40,180
He's adamant about giving U-ju
only organic, home-cooked meals at home,

508
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:43,720
so he always cooks and eats
with his son on weekends.

509
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:10,250
Does it need more vinegar?

510
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:39,820
Hands up.

511
00:30:40,910 --> 00:30:43,490
Are Ma-ne and her dad the only ones
coming this evening?

512
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:46,080
-It's Mo-ne.
-Right, Mo-ne.

513
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:49,750
Does Mo-ne not have a sister?

514
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:51,500
I'm sure she does. One called Ma-ne.

515
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:54,420
She has an older sister, Jang Ma-ne.
They're twins.

516
00:30:56,210 --> 00:30:57,260
See? I knew it.

517
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:00,300
Ma-ne and Mo-ne always go as a set.

518
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,140
Is Ma-ne not coming today?

519
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,970
I don't know. I like Mo-ne.

520
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:07,270
Here you go.

521
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,060
When it comes to love, you never know.

522
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:13,400
I made meatballs.

523
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:16,440
-I even made ketchup from scratch.
-I want jajangmyeon!

524
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:19,400
Hey, come on.

525
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:32,790
What's your name?

526
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:35,090
"Brachyscome angustifolia."

527
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:38,050
It blooms all year round?

528
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:41,970
Your life must be exhausting.

529
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,730
"Geranium"?

530
00:31:53,810 --> 00:31:54,860
I've heard of "plutonium"

531
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:58,940
and "uranium,"
but I've never heard of "geranium."

532
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:01,400
Anyway, nice to meet you.

533
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:04,200
Shouldn't you go to the hospital?

534
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:08,120
Gosh, I'm sick of that place.

535
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:13,000
If I fall ill, I'll just quietly move
into a temple somewhere.

536
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:18,380
Oh, another flower I've never seen before.

537
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:21,010
Hold on. What is your name?

538
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:23,090
Jong-su, try taking a picture of me.

539
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:27,300
Come on.

540
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:40,730
-What does it say?
-What?

541
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,950
Oh, it found a name.

542
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:45,360
-Really?
-Yes.

543
00:32:46,370 --> 00:32:47,740
The name is...

544
00:32:48,370 --> 00:32:50,540
"Your Youth Is Gone."

545
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:51,790
What?

546
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:55,120
It says your youth is gone.

547
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:58,040
For real? Let me see.

548
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,090
Show me.

549
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:02,920
Come on. Show me!

550
00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:04,630
Gosh, no need. What's there to see?

551
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,260
-Hey!
-Goodness.

552
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:09,180
-Gosh, seriously.
-Ouch. Let's go inside.

553
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:11,810
-It's cold. Come on!
-What are you talking about? It's summer.

554
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:14,890
-Gosh, it's so cold.
-Hey, show me. Does it really say that?

555
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:16,020
Hey!

556
00:33:19,150 --> 00:33:21,070
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

557
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:35,330
You look good.
You're young, so you always look pretty.

558
00:33:36,370 --> 00:33:38,880
Oh, you look a little tired today.

559
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:42,210
-Menstrual cramps. I get it every month.
-Oh, no.

560
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:46,430
-I have a question.
-Fire away.

561
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:50,140
Is that the only outfit you have?

562
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:52,140
Yes, this is my summer outfit.

563
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:59,400
What? What are you doing?

564
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:02,320
I can see my reflection on your face.

565
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,980
This is called dewy makeup.

566
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:05,320
It's too much.

567
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:11,240
My mom said fashion that others
don't recognize can't be called fashion.

568
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:15,250
My mom said I should tell my friends
right away when they go the wrong way.

569
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
What the heck?

570
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:33,060
We'll begin the ASD closure
for patient Jeong Jin-ho.

571
00:34:33,890 --> 00:34:37,520
Lead surgeon Do Jae-hak.
First assistant Kim Jun-wan.

572
00:34:37,890 --> 00:34:40,230
Please begin, Dr. Do.

573
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:42,190
Okay.

574
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,170
Don't cut that part.

575
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,970
Be very precise,
or you'll damage other parts.

576
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:11,220
Got it.

577
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:25,150
Again, be precise.
Go down to the endocardium.

578
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:29,570
If you only stitch up the outer layers
that are on sight, it'll bleed later.

579
00:35:29,650 --> 00:35:30,650
Understood, Doctor.

580
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,820
For that part, don't go too deep.

581
00:35:33,570 --> 00:35:36,910
Don't fool your eyes. Look and be precise.

582
00:35:37,490 --> 00:35:38,750
Okay.

583
00:35:41,870 --> 00:35:43,250
Dr. Do.

584
00:35:43,330 --> 00:35:46,460
I got a call from the ICU,
so I can't finish this up.

585
00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:49,420
Can I go?

586
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:51,590
Yes, get going. Thanks for your help.

587
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:54,390
All right, thank you.

588
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:58,180
Professor.

589
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:04,060
Thank you for this opportunity.

590
00:36:04,690 --> 00:36:06,480
I'll do better next time.

591
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:08,230
Okay, do better next time.

592
00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:14,320
Hey.

593
00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:18,580
You actually did better than I thought.
What's gotten into you?

594
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:35,470
-Hello.
-Hello.

595
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:36,970
Pass me my phone.

596
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,470
-Are you guys med students?
-Yes.

597
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:43,520
Where do you live?

598
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,730
I live pretty far.
It takes 50 minutes by subway.

599
00:36:45,810 --> 00:36:48,060
My gosh, that must be tiring.

600
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:51,440
-All right, take it easy.
-Have a nice day, sir.

601
00:37:01,490 --> 00:37:02,540
-Hello.
-Hello.

602
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:04,000
Dr. Jang Gyeo-ul.

603
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:06,210
She's in the OR.

604
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:08,460
Oh, really? Thanks.

605
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:10,840
Med students, right?

606
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,260
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

607
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:13,670
What does your father do?

608
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:16,260
-He's a farmer.
-I see.

609
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,350
Have a good day, sir.

610
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:27,310
Professor.

611
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:30,900
Ji-a's hourly urine output
is less than 3cc.

612
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:33,360
-What about her vitals?
-Her BP is okay,

613
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,820
but her heart rate is around 150bpm.
She has tachycardia.

614
00:37:39,370 --> 00:37:41,410
Professor, we're ready.

615
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:42,790
Okay, I'm coming.

616
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:45,830
It's an imperforate anus surgery,
so I'll finish in two hours.

617
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:48,330
Give her more fluid
and keep me updated, please.

618
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:53,090
Call Professor Lee Ji-yeong
if she gets worse. I'll let her know.

619
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:54,460
Okay.

620
00:38:06,850 --> 00:38:09,560
-Hello.
-Hi, who are you?

621
00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:10,730
I'm a med student.

622
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:13,900
Why did you choose to go to med school?
It's a hard path.

623
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:15,860
-Is there a doctor in your family?
-No.

624
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:19,280
-What does your father do?
-He's a farmer.

625
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,530
I see. Farming is great.

626
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,620
No, the surgery wasn't that hard.

627
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,840
It was for a condition called "ASD,"
an atrial septal defect.

628
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,670
I do it all the time.

629
00:38:36,090 --> 00:38:38,430
Yes, I got it done in no time.

630
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:41,470
Why would I get yelled at?

631
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:48,850
Professor Kim doesn't lose his temper
for no reason.

632
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:52,110
Honey, I'll call you back.

633
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:55,780
-Where are you going?
-Not telling you. Was that your wife?

634
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:57,860
Yes, I bragged about my first surgery.

635
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:59,700
I'm envious that you have a wife.

636
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:01,700
Professor, I signed a long-term lease.

637
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:04,200
No more monthly rent!
The deposit is 200 million won.

638
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,950
I'll invite you to our housewarming party.

639
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:08,750
Did you check everything thoroughly?
There are a lot of rental scams.

640
00:39:08,830 --> 00:39:11,880
It's me who took the college entry exam
four times, and the bar exam six times.

641
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:14,630
Long-term leases are rare these days,

642
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:17,010
so I was wondering if I should
just extend my monthly lease.

643
00:39:17,130 --> 00:39:20,010
But it was one of my realtor's listings,
so I signed it right away.

644
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,590
In other words,
my realtor will be my landlord.

645
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,890
So everything was very easy.
I signed it immediately.

646
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:30,310
Hey, realtors can be scammers too.

647
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:34,190
I checked a certified copy of the register
as well as his ID.

648
00:39:34,310 --> 00:39:36,110
-You should be careful.
-Of what?

649
00:39:36,730 --> 00:39:38,360
Professor Cheon Myeong-tae.

650
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:42,030
I've heard bad rumors about him.
Stay away from him.

651
00:39:42,110 --> 00:39:43,280
"Bad rumors"? Like what?

652
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:46,580
-It's kind of gross.
-Gosh, enough. I don't want to hear it.

653
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:49,620
Be it cheating, gambling, or stealing.
I don't care what he does.

654
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:51,500
Get back to work.
Stop following me around.

655
00:39:52,330 --> 00:39:55,040
-Oh, Professor.
-What? What now?

656
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:57,750
You're seeing someone, right?

657
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,680
You're literally glued to your phone.

658
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:07,640
And if she takes this long
to get back to you,

659
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:10,270
it's safe to assume that she dumped you.

660
00:40:27,490 --> 00:40:28,620
-Hello.
-Hello.

661
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:32,250
Hi, guys. Are you two
the famous Hong-do and Yun-bok?

662
00:40:32,330 --> 00:40:35,540
-Yes, I'm Jang Yun-bok.
-I'm Jang Hong-do.

663
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:38,630
We've met before. I gave you a lot of
sausages at the cafeteria that day.

664
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:41,090
No way. That was him?

665
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:42,720
The chatty cafeteria guy?

666
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:43,880
Be quiet.

667
00:40:43,970 --> 00:40:45,090
Hey.

668
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:46,590
Yes?

669
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:49,930
What songs do kids listen to these days?

670
00:40:50,890 --> 00:40:52,850
-Pardon?
-I'm talking about music.

671
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,730
Tell me the kind of songs
you listen to these days.

672
00:40:56,310 --> 00:40:57,610
IU's songs.

673
00:40:57,980 --> 00:41:00,650
Well, I listen to...

674
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:03,490
Zoo's songs.

675
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:08,990
Hold on. Are you talking
about the band that I like?

676
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,910
How do you know that band?

677
00:41:10,990 --> 00:41:13,290
She always listens to old songs.

678
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:14,290
She's so lame.

679
00:41:14,370 --> 00:41:16,250
No, she's not.
What's lame about old songs?

680
00:41:16,330 --> 00:41:18,290
-You're lamer.
-No, they are lame.

681
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:19,750
He doesn't get romance.

682
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:22,130
I can see that.
Hey, don't hang out with him.

683
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,010
You know nothing...

684
00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:26,760
Yes, I'm on my way now. Okay.

685
00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:29,470
I'm leaving for my rounds.

686
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:31,560
I'll buy you a nice meal
when I see you again. Okay?

687
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,680
Oh, right. Don't stay here.

688
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:34,890
Go to the cafe in the lobby.

689
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:36,100
If you stay here,

690
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:38,730
whoever walks in will try to give you
advice and meddle. Okay?

691
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:40,690
Gosh, I'm out of breath.

692
00:41:40,770 --> 00:41:42,030
Bye.

693
00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:48,320
-Is he a comedian?
-No.

694
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:50,620
He's Dr. Romantic.

695
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:01,630
What's wrong with you? Are you all right?

696
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:04,130
What do you mean? I want Coke.

697
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:06,720
Your face is very swollen.

698
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:07,970
You should...

699
00:42:08,430 --> 00:42:09,760
Oh, this. I have menstrual cramps.

700
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:11,180
I took some medicine.

701
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:13,180
I think the medication
caused the swelling.

702
00:42:14,850 --> 00:42:16,600
Hello, Professor Lee.

703
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:18,390
What happened?

704
00:42:19,650 --> 00:42:21,900
-Go to the ER now.
-What?

705
00:42:22,270 --> 00:42:23,860
I'm all right. I'm just

706
00:42:24,530 --> 00:42:26,530
feeling under the weather today.

707
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:27,820
No, you're not okay.

708
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:30,200
It looks like an allergic reaction.
What did you have today?

709
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:31,950
Nothing really.

710
00:42:34,490 --> 00:42:35,580
What?

711
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:38,000
-Hey.
-Oh, no.

712
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,540
We ran a blood test,

713
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,300
and you have
the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome.

714
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:46,300
To maintain a healthy pregnancy,

715
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:48,130
your blood has to flow well.

716
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:50,430
But with this syndrome,

717
00:42:50,510 --> 00:42:53,140
it's hard for your blood to circulate.

718
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:56,680
Forming a placenta and maintaining
your pregnancy can be difficult.

719
00:42:57,270 --> 00:43:01,560
Then, is this similar to
having recurrent pregnancy loss?

720
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:03,150
Yes.

721
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:07,280
So, this is your third pregnancy.

722
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:09,360
And you had two previous miscarriages.

723
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:13,700
Let's see. You're seven weeks pregnant.

724
00:43:14,830 --> 00:43:15,910
Yes.

725
00:43:18,710 --> 00:43:19,870
Here.

726
00:43:20,370 --> 00:43:23,290
I'd like to prescribe some medication.

727
00:43:23,590 --> 00:43:26,380
You should get heparin shots.

728
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:30,430
This shot will prevent
the blood from clotting.

729
00:43:30,510 --> 00:43:33,180
You can easily get these shots.

730
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:36,600
This is similar to the insulin shots
diabetes patients get.

731
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:38,600
And the needle is very thin,

732
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:40,770
so it won't hurt as much.

733
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:43,440
And our nurse will thoroughly explain

734
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:46,020
how to inject the shots
and take the medication.

735
00:43:46,110 --> 00:43:49,440
Come back after two weeks,
and I'll check on your condition, then.

736
00:43:54,530 --> 00:43:55,780
Professor,

737
00:43:56,780 --> 00:43:59,660
you must have seen a lot of mothers
with this kind of disease.

738
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:02,670
So you must think
this is nothing serious, right?

739
00:44:04,670 --> 00:44:06,670
Why is miscarriage a disease?

740
00:44:12,430 --> 00:44:14,180
Miscarriage isn't a disease.

741
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:18,010
Of course, you did nothing wrong here.

742
00:44:19,930 --> 00:44:22,440
A lot of patients
that had miscarriages ask me

743
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:25,770
if they did something wrong
or if they must be careful in the future.

744
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:26,810
That's not true.

745
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:30,530
This can happen to anyone.

746
00:44:32,530 --> 00:44:34,910
And besides, you know the cause this time.

747
00:44:34,990 --> 00:44:36,780
We can prepare for it
and help you get treated.

748
00:44:36,870 --> 00:44:39,120
Then you may be able to
have a healthy baby.

749
00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:41,660
So make sure you get your heparin shots.

750
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:44,040
And take it easy for the time being.

751
00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:46,460
Okay.

752
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:48,210
Thank you.

753
00:44:52,010 --> 00:44:53,470
-Are we done?
-Yes.

754
00:44:53,550 --> 00:44:54,430
We're done for today.

755
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:55,680
Lunch?

756
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:58,390
It's on me. Let's go!

757
00:44:58,930 --> 00:44:59,930
Okay.

758
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:06,230
Two pieces of chocolate cake,
to-go, please.

759
00:45:06,730 --> 00:45:09,650
-How many forks do you need?
-One. Both of them are for me.

760
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:13,150
Cardiothoracic Surgery, Code Blue.

761
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:15,320
To the hallway in front of Room 6210.

762
00:45:15,410 --> 00:45:17,780
-Emergency for CS, right?
-Cardiothoracic Surgery, Code Blue.

763
00:45:17,870 --> 00:45:20,160
To the hallway in front of Room 6210.

764
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:42,850
-Is it Professor Park Jin-u's patient?
-Yes.

765
00:45:42,930 --> 00:45:45,440
The patient had endocarditis,
so they performed an AVR.

766
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:47,400
I'll check the rhythm.

767
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:51,980
-His heart is beating.
-Mr. Lee Jong-hyeon.

768
00:45:52,530 --> 00:45:54,360
Mr. Lee Jong-hyeon, are you all right?

769
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:02,120
What a relief.

770
00:46:03,450 --> 00:46:04,910
-Bye.
-Bye.

771
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,580
Check if it's flowing right. Well done.

772
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:12,170
Professor Kim.

773
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:14,880
Hello.

774
00:46:15,670 --> 00:46:16,720
I'm Cheon Myeong-tae.

775
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:19,260
Hi. I'm Kim Jun-wan.

776
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:22,050
So you're the big shot at CS.

777
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:23,890
I am?

778
00:46:23,970 --> 00:46:26,980
You're in charge of the VIP Ward,
so I say you are.

779
00:46:28,810 --> 00:46:30,730
One's talent makes
all the difference to doctors.

780
00:46:34,650 --> 00:46:36,400
What are you doing this weekend?

781
00:46:37,490 --> 00:46:38,700
Do you like golf?

782
00:46:41,780 --> 00:46:43,780
Over there. There are two empty seats.

783
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:46,080
Professor Yang, over there.

784
00:46:46,620 --> 00:46:48,210
Go ahead. It's all right.

785
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:50,540
Seon-jin, take the seat over there.

786
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:52,840
Professor Yang, let's sit here.

787
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:53,920
Okay.

788
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:04,470
I have a question.

789
00:47:05,060 --> 00:47:07,100
-Can I?
-Yes.

790
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:11,440
Well,

791
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:14,820
you met a woman in a navy lace dress

792
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:17,900
at the outdoor garden last week.
Who is she?

793
00:47:20,450 --> 00:47:21,280
You two

794
00:47:22,110 --> 00:47:24,370
looked cozy together
when you were talking to each other.

795
00:47:24,450 --> 00:47:25,740
Who is she?

796
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:33,710
Oh, her.

797
00:47:34,590 --> 00:47:37,050
The mistress of Taegeon Apparel's
Chairman Yang Tae-yang.

798
00:47:37,130 --> 00:47:38,210
What?

799
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:40,550
She's the mistress
of Chairman Yang Tae-yang.

800
00:47:41,510 --> 00:47:42,340
I see.

801
00:47:42,430 --> 00:47:44,100
It was in the news, so you know, right?

802
00:47:44,180 --> 00:47:46,350
I think the whole hospital knows.

803
00:47:46,930 --> 00:47:49,520
I'm all right. I've been used to it
since I was in school.

804
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:59,150
I see empty seats over there.
Jeong-won, look.

805
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:00,070
Okay.

806
00:48:02,030 --> 00:48:05,580
Oh, right. Hey, do we have
band practice tomorrow?

807
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:09,410
Don't make any plans tomorrow night.
Okay, Jeong-won?

808
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:10,370
Okay.

809
00:48:13,170 --> 00:48:14,960
You finished.
You didn't pick at your food.

810
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:16,750
I was never picky with my food.

811
00:48:17,550 --> 00:48:19,840
Don't be picky with people, you prick.

812
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:23,340
My resident is here.

813
00:48:26,550 --> 00:48:28,430
You're best friends with Dr. Jang, right?

814
00:48:28,850 --> 00:48:30,680
Yes, I am. How do you know that?

815
00:48:31,310 --> 00:48:32,690
I see you together all the time.

816
00:48:32,770 --> 00:48:34,770
Right. Gyeo-ul is in the ER now.

817
00:48:34,850 --> 00:48:35,940
My gosh, why?

818
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:38,360
It's gotten better after she got the shot.

819
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:40,480
I think she had anaphylaxis from NSAIDs.

820
00:48:40,570 --> 00:48:41,610
SUDDEN REACTION TO THE BODY

821
00:48:41,690 --> 00:48:44,280
Her face swelled 30 minutes
after taking the pill for cramps.

822
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:45,450
Then, she couldn't breathe.

823
00:48:45,530 --> 00:48:47,700
She passed out like a scene in the movie.

824
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:50,240
-Oh, no. Please excuse me.
-Okay.

825
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:52,660
She's much better now.

826
00:48:52,750 --> 00:48:54,080
She's probably asleep.

827
00:48:55,540 --> 00:48:57,960
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

828
00:49:11,890 --> 00:49:13,230
Gosh. Are you okay?

829
00:49:13,430 --> 00:49:15,480
Are you in pain? Should I call Hui-su?

830
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:18,060
No. I'm not in pain anymore.

831
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:20,360
Did you sleep here?

832
00:49:20,690 --> 00:49:21,980
Is it dawn now?

833
00:49:22,740 --> 00:49:24,200
Yes, it's night.

834
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:27,620
But you've been getting
a lot of text messages.

835
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:29,490
A lot of professors came to check on you.

836
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:35,460
I should have chosen GS too.

837
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:37,920
They don't treat you like a resident.

838
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,880
You're treated like a princess.

839
00:49:46,930 --> 00:49:48,300
I heard you were sick.

840
00:49:48,430 --> 00:49:50,050
Are you feeling better now?

841
00:49:50,140 --> 00:49:51,930
Get a lot of rest and feel better.

842
00:49:52,430 --> 00:49:53,890
He sent me a smiley face, right?

843
00:49:56,190 --> 00:49:57,850
Yes. A smiley face.

844
00:49:57,940 --> 00:50:00,310
That's not a tilde. It's a smiley face.

845
00:50:01,610 --> 00:50:03,440
Yes, it is. It's a smiley face.

846
00:50:03,530 --> 00:50:04,740
What about it?

847
00:50:07,530 --> 00:50:09,530
Could he have feelings for me?

848
00:50:09,620 --> 00:50:11,080
What?

849
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:13,450
Professor Ahn likes me, right?

850
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:16,410
No.

851
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,250
Why not?

852
00:50:18,330 --> 00:50:20,040
If he likes you,

853
00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:22,170
he would have come here.

854
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:29,510
You like him, don't you?

855
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:33,890
Dr. Jang,

856
00:50:33,970 --> 00:50:37,230
you like Professor Ahn, right?

857
00:50:42,270 --> 00:50:43,150
Yes.

858
00:50:52,830 --> 00:50:53,870
Yes, Song-hwa.

859
00:50:54,830 --> 00:50:57,120
Okay. Hold on.

860
00:50:57,870 --> 00:51:00,330
Jun-wan, Song-hwa needs to talk to us.
She wants to grab dinner.

861
00:51:00,420 --> 00:51:02,920
-You're free, right?
-Of course.

862
00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:04,500
Yes, he can.

863
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,550
Okay. We're on our way out, too.

864
00:51:08,170 --> 00:51:09,510
Okay. See you soon.

865
00:51:12,140 --> 00:51:14,930
Something sounded off about her.
Did something happen?

866
00:51:17,270 --> 00:51:19,190
Why? How did she sound?

867
00:51:20,230 --> 00:51:22,190
She acts as if everything is fine,

868
00:51:22,270 --> 00:51:24,610
but I think something is up with her.

869
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:30,150
Why are you telling us that now?

870
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:31,950
When did you get tested?

871
00:51:34,030 --> 00:51:35,530
It's been a week.

872
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:37,370
I got a biopsy.

873
00:51:37,830 --> 00:51:39,120
I'll get the result tomorrow.

874
00:51:41,290 --> 00:51:42,670
The core biopsy.

875
00:51:42,750 --> 00:51:43,960
Yes, that.

876
00:51:47,130 --> 00:51:48,340
The shape doesn't look good.

877
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:52,760
When the doctor told me that,
it did scare me a bit.

878
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:54,760
Hey, how could you joke about that?

879
00:51:54,850 --> 00:51:57,600
Why did you go to Jae-an Medical Center?
If you had asked me or Ik-jun,

880
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:59,230
we would've taken care of it right away.

881
00:51:59,310 --> 00:52:00,680
When does the result come out?

882
00:52:00,770 --> 00:52:03,190
My cousin works there. I'll ask him now.

883
00:52:03,270 --> 00:52:05,610
My gosh, stop it.

884
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:08,780
I didn't tell you
because I knew you'd make a fuss.

885
00:52:10,110 --> 00:52:13,160
If it's bad,
people in the hospital will talk about it.

886
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:14,660
I hate that.

887
00:52:14,740 --> 00:52:16,080
What are you talking about?

888
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:17,660
It's not going to be bad.

889
00:52:18,330 --> 00:52:20,120
The result must be out already.
I'll call them.

890
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:22,120
Stop it. Don't. Seriously, stop it.

891
00:52:22,210 --> 00:52:24,380
I'll find out tomorrow morning.
What's the point?

892
00:52:24,460 --> 00:52:26,750
I really don't want you to do it,
so don't.

893
00:52:28,210 --> 00:52:31,130
This is why I had it done
at another hospital.

894
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:34,510
Please don't do anything. Please?

895
00:52:34,590 --> 00:52:36,100
What time tomorrow?

896
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:38,220
-Seven.
-That early?

897
00:52:38,310 --> 00:52:41,230
Yes. My schedule is full this week.

898
00:52:41,310 --> 00:52:43,640
When I said I couldn't make it,
they bumped me up by an hour.

899
00:52:43,730 --> 00:52:46,190
They start seeing outpatients at eight
like we do.

900
00:52:46,270 --> 00:52:47,610
I'm very grateful for it.

901
00:52:47,690 --> 00:52:51,030
Did you say you couldn't get the result
because of your outpatients?

902
00:52:52,030 --> 00:52:53,900
Unbelievable.
You could've talked to the hospital

903
00:52:53,990 --> 00:52:55,700
and rescheduled the appointments.

904
00:52:55,780 --> 00:52:57,030
Are you that inflexible?

905
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:59,950
How could I do that? Some patients
made appointments months ago.

906
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:02,120
Many are coming to Seoul
from the countryside.

907
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:05,330
I'll be fine.
I'll go and get the result myself.

908
00:53:06,250 --> 00:53:08,540
My gosh, you and your nagging.

909
00:53:08,630 --> 00:53:10,500
But that's an excellent doctor.

910
00:53:11,010 --> 00:53:12,970
Your doctor is coming to work
early for you.

911
00:53:13,050 --> 00:53:15,760
Right? It's so early. I can never do that.

912
00:53:16,340 --> 00:53:18,140
Let me know as soon as you get the result.

913
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:19,720
Okay.

914
00:53:19,810 --> 00:53:23,100
-Should I go with you?
-Don't you dare! I'm serious.

915
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:25,640
I'm sure it's nothing.

916
00:53:25,730 --> 00:53:27,980
Hey, let's eat. Dig in.

917
00:53:33,490 --> 00:53:34,820
It's not mine.

918
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:36,410
Not mine.

919
00:53:41,450 --> 00:53:42,450
Yes?

920
00:53:46,370 --> 00:53:47,750
Are the vitals stable?

921
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:49,880
Is there free air?

922
00:53:50,750 --> 00:53:52,000
Yes, I'm nearby.

923
00:53:53,670 --> 00:53:55,840
If there are a liver laceration
and a perforated bowel,

924
00:53:55,930 --> 00:53:57,470
I should explore that.

925
00:53:57,760 --> 00:53:59,970
Okay. I'll be there soon.

926
00:54:01,010 --> 00:54:03,390
Darn it. I'm leaving.

927
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:04,850
Good luck.

928
00:54:08,690 --> 00:54:11,020
I got off work,
but I'm at the hospital again.

929
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:13,400
Do you have an emergency patient?

930
00:54:14,150 --> 00:54:15,780
Yes, the patient was in a car accident.

931
00:54:15,860 --> 00:54:18,490
I think the patient's liver
and bowel need surgery.

932
00:54:18,570 --> 00:54:22,080
Oh, no. You'll probably
have to pull an all-nighter.

933
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:24,120
Yes, I'll probably be done in the morning.

934
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:25,410
And that's if I'm fast.

935
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:28,620
Then, you should come to my shoot
when you're done in the morning.

936
00:54:28,710 --> 00:54:29,790
It's nearby.

937
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:32,040
I must be on standby
early in the morning tomorrow, too.

938
00:54:32,130 --> 00:54:35,380
I'll buy you coffee. There are a lot
of convenience stores nearby.

939
00:54:35,460 --> 00:54:38,180
I should buy you coffee.
You treated me last time.

940
00:54:39,890 --> 00:54:42,510
If I finish early in the morning,

941
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:45,140
I'll try to visit you.
I might not be able to make it, though.

942
00:54:45,220 --> 00:54:47,390
Okay. Good luck with the surgery.

943
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:49,730
I hope I can see you tomorrow morning.

944
00:54:49,980 --> 00:54:51,150
Okay.

945
00:54:52,730 --> 00:54:54,820
ELAPSED TIME

946
00:55:00,570 --> 00:55:02,120
I think the repair is holding well.

947
00:55:31,850 --> 00:55:33,360
I'll take these.

948
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:56,440
COMPREHENSIVE MEDICAL EXAMINATION CENTER

949
00:57:08,370 --> 00:57:11,200
Seriously? Why are you here?

950
00:57:12,450 --> 00:57:15,080
Why do you think?
I came because I'm worried.

951
00:57:23,340 --> 00:57:25,470
Look at that big yawn. Goodness.

952
00:57:25,550 --> 00:57:27,890
You should just get some sleep at home.

953
00:57:27,970 --> 00:57:30,680
-Why did you come?
-How could I sleep?

954
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:34,140
Hello.

955
00:57:34,230 --> 00:57:35,560
Hello.

956
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:37,230
Thank you for seeing us this early.

957
00:57:37,310 --> 00:57:39,440
Gosh, don't mention it.
This happens a few times.

958
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:42,400
-Please wait.
-Hold on. Have some of this.

959
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:44,240
It's really cheap. It's nothing big.

960
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:45,400
No, it's all right.

961
00:57:45,490 --> 00:57:47,360
I bought way too many. That's why.

962
00:57:47,450 --> 00:57:49,120
Please take some. I'm begging you.

963
00:57:49,910 --> 00:57:51,830
Thank you. Please give us ten minutes.

964
00:57:51,910 --> 00:57:52,910
Okay. We can wait.

965
00:58:06,260 --> 00:58:10,550
Hey, what if I have cancer?

966
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:13,600
You can get it fixed.

967
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:18,400
I'll fix it no matter what.

968
00:58:23,820 --> 00:58:26,280
-It's nice.
-What?

969
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:28,320
Getting a confident answer
from the doctor.

970
00:58:30,490 --> 00:58:35,290
Now, I understand why doctors
shouldn't give out such answers.

971
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,210
It's so nice to hear that.

972
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:43,340
It makes me think
you'll fix whatever is wrong with me.

973
00:58:45,380 --> 00:58:49,090
That's why I should never say things
like that to my patients.

974
00:58:50,090 --> 00:58:51,760
What if something goes wrong?

975
00:58:54,060 --> 00:58:55,680
If the result comes out badly,

976
00:58:59,650 --> 00:59:02,270
I think they would be in utter despair.

977
00:59:13,490 --> 00:59:14,740
Yes, Seok-hyeong.

978
00:59:16,620 --> 00:59:18,080
I'm about to go in.

979
00:59:19,460 --> 00:59:22,040
Okay. I'll tell you right away.

980
00:59:23,460 --> 00:59:24,840
Okay.

981
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:31,220
-Can Seok-hyeong make calls?
-Yes. Why?

982
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:33,680
I thought he only texted.

983
00:59:34,050 --> 00:59:35,760
He calls me often.

984
00:59:41,900 --> 00:59:43,400
A long time ago,

985
00:59:43,900 --> 00:59:45,860
Seok-hyeong liked you a lot.

986
00:59:46,110 --> 00:59:47,150
Hey.

987
00:59:48,150 --> 00:59:49,740
That's ancient history.

988
00:59:50,610 --> 00:59:54,910
You know the day when
Seok-hyeong told you that he liked you?

989
00:59:55,830 --> 00:59:57,660
Did you know that he slept on the street?

990
00:59:58,910 --> 01:00:00,660
-Really?
-Yes.

991
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:04,130
He and I had drinks that night.

992
01:00:04,330 --> 01:00:07,090
He told me that he confessed his feelings
and you turned him down.

993
01:00:08,420 --> 01:00:10,090
We had drinks and went home.

994
01:00:10,170 --> 01:00:12,340
But late at night,
I got a call from the police station.

995
01:00:12,430 --> 01:00:13,840
They told me to take my friend home.

996
01:00:14,090 --> 01:00:16,510
They called me
because I was the last person he called.

997
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:18,520
I was confused and went to the station.

998
01:00:19,020 --> 01:00:22,770
My gosh. He was sleeping on the street,
and the officers brought him there

999
01:00:22,850 --> 01:00:24,770
so he didn't freeze to death.

1000
01:00:26,820 --> 01:00:29,030
Seriously.
That brings back so many memories.

1001
01:00:29,110 --> 01:00:30,570
So many memories.

1002
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:36,660
Wait, so you knew.

1003
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:39,490
Why did you pretend you didn't?

1004
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:42,410
I only knew that Seok-hyeong liked you.

1005
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:43,710
I didn't know it in detail.

1006
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:46,290
Ms. Chae Song-hwa, please come in.

1007
01:00:46,790 --> 01:00:47,630
Okay.

1008
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:09,480
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

1009
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:21,660
We have ten more minutes, right?

1010
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,040
Yes.

1011
01:01:24,540 --> 01:01:25,960
Should I go and get you some coffee?

1012
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:29,000
No. I'm good. I was just checking.

1013
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:31,920
Wait. Now that you ask me,

1014
01:01:32,010 --> 01:01:33,920
I kind of want coffee.

1015
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:36,640
What is it?

1016
01:01:37,340 --> 01:01:40,560
-I'm fine. It's benign.
-Okay. Great.

1017
01:01:46,980 --> 01:01:48,440
What's the result?

1018
01:01:49,360 --> 01:01:52,320
It's a fibroadenoma.
We'll test it again in six months.

1019
01:01:52,980 --> 01:01:54,570
I knew it.

1020
01:01:54,650 --> 01:01:56,990
-You did well. See you later, then.
-Okay.

1021
01:02:00,950 --> 01:02:03,870
It's benign. Are we good now?

1022
01:02:09,250 --> 01:02:10,460
Did everyone come?

1023
01:02:10,540 --> 01:02:12,210
There's one more.

1024
01:02:13,380 --> 01:02:14,970
Did you call the guys today?

1025
01:02:15,050 --> 01:02:16,840
I saw them visit you one at a time.

1026
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:19,510
You know we have
band practice today, right?

1027
01:02:19,590 --> 01:02:20,680
See you later.

1028
01:02:22,430 --> 01:02:24,980
My brother-in-law, have a great day.

1029
01:02:49,460 --> 01:02:51,040
You can't finish it, right? Pour me some.

1030
01:02:52,250 --> 01:02:54,300
What if we get addicted to Coke?

1031
01:02:54,380 --> 01:02:57,340
I can't drink because I'm worried
that the hospital will call me.

1032
01:02:57,840 --> 01:03:00,640
Jun-wan, do you want Coke or Sprite?

1033
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:02,800
He's busy.
His mom's about to build a hinoki tub.

1034
01:03:02,890 --> 01:03:05,470
What? You want to switch to cypress?

1035
01:03:06,140 --> 01:03:10,020
Mom, hinoki is cypress.
They are the same thing.

1036
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:13,400
Heopa also means lung. Kongpat, kidney.

1037
01:03:13,480 --> 01:03:15,480
Jjijimi, pancake. Jeonguji, chives.

1038
01:03:15,570 --> 01:03:17,400
-Jeonguji means chives?
-Yes.

1039
01:03:18,150 --> 01:03:19,400
I'm with my friends.

1040
01:03:21,160 --> 01:03:23,370
Okay. I'll call you later.

1041
01:03:24,410 --> 01:03:25,240
Okay.

1042
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:27,410
We're playing Zoo's song, right?

1043
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:28,910
Did you bring your guitar?

1044
01:03:29,960 --> 01:03:33,460
You can switch back to standard Korean
right away. That's impressive.

1045
01:03:33,540 --> 01:03:35,300
What? I don't speak with a dialect.

1046
01:03:35,380 --> 01:03:37,210
Buddy, eat it with jeonguji.

1047
01:03:37,300 --> 01:03:38,970
All right.

1048
01:03:39,050 --> 01:03:40,300
Did you know

1049
01:03:41,180 --> 01:03:42,800
you two had a huge transformation?

1050
01:03:45,100 --> 01:03:46,850
-Us two?
-Yes.

1051
01:03:46,930 --> 01:03:48,390
What on earth are you talking about?

1052
01:03:49,140 --> 01:03:51,100
These guys looked worse back then.
Especially, you.

1053
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:54,940
What about me?

1054
01:03:55,020 --> 01:03:57,690
You wanted to copy Leslie Cheung.
You parted your hair and got a perm.

1055
01:03:58,320 --> 01:04:00,400
Don't distort the truth, Ik-jun.

1056
01:04:00,950 --> 01:04:02,740
You two were worse.

1057
01:04:02,820 --> 01:04:03,910
How did we look back then?

1058
01:04:19,590 --> 01:04:21,170
Like this.

1059
01:04:21,260 --> 01:04:22,590
You prick.

1060
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:24,760
-You prick.
-That was Jun-wan.

1061
01:04:25,640 --> 01:04:26,970
You prick.

1062
01:04:27,100 --> 01:04:29,520
No, they weren't that bad.
They looked like this.

1063
01:04:30,020 --> 01:04:31,100
-You prick.
-No.

1064
01:04:31,180 --> 01:04:33,100
-He looked like this.
-My gosh. Hey.

1065
01:04:33,190 --> 01:04:36,480
LINE 2, EXIT 3

1066
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:38,480
Is this the way?

1067
01:04:43,910 --> 01:04:46,070
Where's the school? Why can't I see it?

1068
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:48,740
We have to take a bus here. Bus 289-1.

1069
01:04:48,830 --> 01:04:50,660
It's the school entrance. Why take a bus?

1070
01:04:52,790 --> 01:04:54,290
If I knew the answer to that,

1071
01:04:54,370 --> 01:04:57,130
why would I be standing here with you,
holding this paper like a fool?

1072
01:04:57,210 --> 01:05:00,050
-It's freezing cold today.
-You said you'd been to Seoul. You forgot?

1073
01:05:00,130 --> 01:05:03,260
You've been here too, man. We went to
the National Assembly on our school trip.

1074
01:05:04,340 --> 01:05:05,840
-Did we?
-Yes.

1075
01:05:09,510 --> 01:05:11,390
Do you have any change? A 1,000-won bill?

1076
01:05:13,060 --> 01:05:15,310
I only have 10,000-won bills.

1077
01:05:15,810 --> 01:05:17,440
Same here.

1078
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:18,520
How much is the bus fare?

1079
01:05:19,020 --> 01:05:20,900
-It's 340 won. Seriously?
-What?

1080
01:05:20,980 --> 01:05:23,570
Things in Seoul are so expensive.
It's no place to live!

1081
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:25,950
But I'm still going to live in Seoul.

1082
01:05:26,030 --> 01:05:28,620
-Wait here. I'll go and break the bill.
-At where?

1083
01:05:28,700 --> 01:05:31,580
I'll buy something at the cart over there
and get smaller bills.

1084
01:05:35,170 --> 01:05:36,040
Sir.

1085
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,500
How much is it?

1086
01:05:38,590 --> 01:05:41,670
Where are you from? Busan? Masan?

1087
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:44,170
That's 700 won.

1088
01:05:51,600 --> 01:05:53,430
-What about this?
-3,000 won.

1089
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:54,430
Here.

1090
01:05:55,600 --> 01:05:56,560
Here.

1091
01:05:57,440 --> 01:05:58,560
Good luck with the interview.

1092
01:05:58,650 --> 01:06:00,610
Thank you. Have a good day.

1093
01:06:01,150 --> 01:06:02,820
MEDICAL SCHOOL INTERVIEW
WAITING AREA

1094
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:05,530
EXAM SCHEDULE

1095
01:06:15,580 --> 01:06:18,920
Ik-jun, I don't think I did well
on my essay exam.

1096
01:06:19,170 --> 01:06:22,130
You should cut
your side-swept bangs first.

1097
01:06:22,210 --> 01:06:24,840
-What do you mean?
-I had to take a dump in the bathroom.

1098
01:06:24,920 --> 01:06:26,880
But it was packed with people,

1099
01:06:26,970 --> 01:06:29,010
so I used the staff bathroom downstairs.

1100
01:06:29,090 --> 01:06:30,890
Guess what I heard there.

1101
01:06:31,050 --> 01:06:34,890
Do you know what the most important factor
they are considering this year is?

1102
01:06:35,310 --> 01:06:36,350
What is it?

1103
01:06:37,230 --> 01:06:38,350
Jeonggal.

1104
01:06:39,230 --> 01:06:40,310
Jeongal?

1105
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:44,030
No, I said, Jeonggal. Not scorpion.

1106
01:06:44,110 --> 01:06:47,610
Jeonggam? You mean, "warmhearted"?
Gosh, that's my weak point.

1107
01:06:48,740 --> 01:06:50,870
Go and clean your ears first, you prick.

1108
01:06:50,950 --> 01:06:52,160
I saw a shovel over there.

1109
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:54,160
-What the heck?
-Neatness.

1110
01:06:54,700 --> 01:06:56,960
They're going to pick neat students.

1111
01:06:57,040 --> 01:06:58,120
Go cut your hair now.

1112
01:06:58,210 --> 01:06:59,290
Really? Darn it.

1113
01:07:12,010 --> 01:07:13,970
-Thank you.
-Don't mention it.

1114
01:08:05,360 --> 01:08:09,490
I saw you again in front

1115
01:08:09,570 --> 01:08:13,160
Of the subway station at the city hall

1116
01:08:13,570 --> 01:08:17,790
When I turned around to buy newspapers

1117
01:08:17,870 --> 01:08:21,040
I saw your figure

1118
01:08:21,620 --> 01:08:26,670
At the crowded newsstand

1119
01:08:26,750 --> 01:08:30,470
When I called out your name

1120
01:08:31,510 --> 01:08:34,890
You looked surprised

1121
01:08:46,270 --> 01:08:50,610
When I was about to go to you

1122
01:08:50,690 --> 01:08:54,910
I stepped on someone's foot

1123
01:08:54,990 --> 01:08:59,580
I had to say I was sorry

1124
01:08:59,660 --> 01:09:02,290
With a big smile

1125
01:09:02,790 --> 01:09:08,130
We talked about our lives
And how we changed

1126
01:09:08,210 --> 01:09:12,420
We even talked about the weather
Which was boring

1127
01:09:12,510 --> 01:09:15,640
The flooding memories

1128
01:09:15,720 --> 01:09:19,470
Quickly exhausted us

1129
01:09:19,850 --> 01:09:23,730
That time which seemed so slow

1130
01:09:23,810 --> 01:09:27,650
Passed us by

1131
01:09:28,150 --> 01:09:32,190
You told me that you were a mother of two

1132
01:09:32,280 --> 01:09:35,450
With a gentle smile on your face

1133
01:09:36,160 --> 01:09:41,410
When you asked me how I am doing

1134
01:09:41,490 --> 01:09:45,500
I just shrugged my shoulders
In disappointment

1135
01:09:45,580 --> 01:09:48,750
And told you that I was still looking for

1136
01:09:48,840 --> 01:09:52,590
The love of my life somewhere
In this world

1137
01:09:54,300 --> 01:10:00,760
-If we run into each other again someday
-If we run into each other again someday

1138
01:10:02,220 --> 01:10:08,270
-You said you'd show me your children
-You said you'd show me your children

1139
01:10:10,770 --> 01:10:16,860
-But the song engraved in our hearts
-But the song engraved in our hearts

1140
01:10:17,320 --> 01:10:20,370
-From that day
-From that day

1141
01:10:20,450 --> 01:10:25,000
-Is still fresh like it was yesterday
-Is still fresh like it was yesterday

1142
01:11:23,890 --> 01:11:28,180
You told me that
Things were getting tough between us

1143
01:11:28,690 --> 01:11:32,110
That could have been
The reason you left me

1144
01:11:33,110 --> 01:11:36,360
But I can't know for sure

1145
01:11:36,440 --> 01:11:38,860
Sing it, everyone.

1146
01:11:41,570 --> 01:11:45,870
I remember the night when you left me

1147
01:11:51,080 --> 01:11:54,880
You in my memory

1148
01:11:57,510 --> 01:11:58,670
All right.

1149
01:11:58,760 --> 01:12:01,930
Hey, I'm sorry. No, I mean... Never mind.

1150
01:12:02,010 --> 01:12:03,140
I'm okay.

1151
01:12:03,970 --> 01:12:07,520
Song-hwa, I'm sorry for bringing up
such nonsense.

1152
01:12:38,460 --> 01:12:39,880
Did you want to meet up?

1153
01:12:40,470 --> 01:12:42,470
Okay. Where should we meet?

1154
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:47,010
I'm sorry. Something just came up.

1155
01:12:47,510 --> 01:12:48,600
Let's meet some other time.

1156
01:13:07,160 --> 01:13:10,410
DRINKS AND MEALS,
CUSTOMERS FOR A CENTURY

1157
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:12,330
No. Bye.

1158
01:14:21,270 --> 01:14:22,190
Hello?

1159
01:14:23,860 --> 01:14:25,700
Where? Who is this?

1160
01:14:46,670 --> 01:14:52,050
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, CHAE SONG-HWA

1161
01:14:52,140 --> 01:14:55,060
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

1162
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:02,860
Thank you. Thank you for the coffee.

1163
01:15:03,980 --> 01:15:06,070
You're even diligent. My gosh.

1164
01:15:09,240 --> 01:15:12,330
If you have questions, ask Song-hwa.
She really likes that.

1165
01:15:12,410 --> 01:15:13,700
Okay.

1166
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:16,580
Professor Chae is a good person.

1167
01:15:17,210 --> 01:15:18,460
She is.

1168
01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:22,790
I respect her very much and like her.

1169
01:15:24,670 --> 01:15:26,380
Okay.

1170
01:15:29,010 --> 01:15:30,760
Have you been talking to Ik-sun lately?

1171
01:15:30,840 --> 01:15:32,050
Yes.

1172
01:15:32,470 --> 01:15:34,390
We talk on the phone at least once a week.

1173
01:15:34,470 --> 01:15:36,140
She's a really close friend of mine.

1174
01:15:36,890 --> 01:15:38,350
Just like you and Professor Chae.

1175
01:15:38,430 --> 01:15:42,060
Right. There are times when I realize
she's a woman, not just a friend.

1176
01:15:42,150 --> 01:15:43,400
My gosh, no.

1177
01:15:43,480 --> 01:15:46,280
We're really not involved romantically.

1178
01:15:47,070 --> 01:15:51,360
Besides, Ik-sun is still hurt
by what happened in the past.

1179
01:15:53,410 --> 01:15:55,990
She said she's not ready to date

1180
01:15:56,910 --> 01:15:58,290
someone yet.

1181
01:15:59,790 --> 01:16:01,080
She said she can't trust anyone.

1182
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:05,000
I think it will take her some time.

1183
01:16:05,750 --> 01:16:07,050
Really?

1184
01:16:09,380 --> 01:16:10,550
Probably.

1185
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:33,030
I'm paying this month's utility bill.

1186
01:16:33,110 --> 01:16:35,030
Jeong-won said he already paid.

1187
01:16:35,120 --> 01:16:37,830
My gosh, I guess
he's doing better financially.

1188
01:16:37,910 --> 01:16:39,410
That moocher paid the utility bill.

1189
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:42,330
Did something happen?

1190
01:16:42,420 --> 01:16:44,330
You look down today.

1191
01:16:45,460 --> 01:16:46,960
It's nothing really. But...

1192
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:49,840
My gosh, I had no idea,

1193
01:16:52,010 --> 01:16:53,340
but Ik-sun...

1194
01:16:57,560 --> 01:16:59,060
A NEW MESSAGE FROM IK-SUN

1195
01:16:59,640 --> 01:17:00,850
Bye.

1196
01:17:13,240 --> 01:17:14,610
Yes for what?

1197
01:17:22,870 --> 01:17:24,620
Today is our first day as a couple.

1198
01:18:02,240 --> 01:18:03,620
Hello?

1199
01:18:05,790 --> 01:18:07,000
What are you doing?

1200
01:18:09,090 --> 01:18:11,130
Really? Okay.

1201
01:18:12,210 --> 01:18:14,300
I don't have any surgery today.

1202
01:18:14,380 --> 01:18:15,760
Did you eat?

1203
01:18:16,880 --> 01:18:17,890
Who?

1204
01:18:19,850 --> 01:18:22,350
I see. I didn't know
there was a position for that.

1205
01:18:23,060 --> 01:18:24,350
Are you guys close to each other?

1206
01:18:25,020 --> 01:18:26,270
I see.

1207
01:18:27,270 --> 01:18:30,520
Okay. When is your next day off?

1208
01:18:34,780 --> 01:18:37,150
No, don't do that.

1209
01:18:37,240 --> 01:18:39,030
I'll go pick you up.

1210
01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:40,120
Okay.

1211
01:18:42,450 --> 01:18:43,700
Are you sure?

1212
01:18:43,790 --> 01:18:45,660
Yes, Ji-a will be the recipient.

1213
01:18:46,250 --> 01:18:49,170
The donor is a 22-year-old female.
She weighs 49kg.

1214
01:18:49,250 --> 01:18:51,790
And her LFT is under 40. It's all good.

1215
01:18:51,880 --> 01:18:54,050
She stayed at Kangwoon Medical Center
for seven days.

1216
01:18:54,130 --> 01:18:56,590
Then, we'll get the surgery ready.

1217
01:18:57,300 --> 01:18:58,380
Okay.

1218
01:19:00,720 --> 01:19:02,300
Oh my gosh!

1219
01:19:03,640 --> 01:19:04,970
Thank you, doctor.

1220
01:19:05,930 --> 01:19:07,480
Thank you so much, doctor.

1221
01:19:07,560 --> 01:19:09,100
Thank you.

1222
01:19:09,310 --> 01:19:11,440
Thank you so much, doctor.

1223
01:19:13,360 --> 01:19:16,570
The committee that confirms brain death
must still go through the protocol.

1224
01:19:16,650 --> 01:19:20,280
And we must check the condition
of the liver from the donor.

1225
01:19:20,780 --> 01:19:23,030
But I think this will work.

1226
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:26,200
We can proceed with the surgery tonight
at the earliest.

1227
01:19:31,380 --> 01:19:34,000
Then, my daughter, Ji-a,

1228
01:19:34,590 --> 01:19:37,380
can live now. Right, doctor?

1229
01:19:38,260 --> 01:19:39,470
Yes.

1230
01:19:40,130 --> 01:19:42,850
Thank you. Thank you so much.

1231
01:19:57,490 --> 01:19:59,820
How's the liver? Are you heading here now?

1232
01:19:59,900 --> 01:20:01,530
We have a problem, Professor Ahn.

1233
01:20:02,240 --> 01:20:03,570
What's wrong?

1234
01:20:03,660 --> 01:20:05,370
The donor's liver is too thick.

1235
01:20:06,620 --> 01:20:08,080
It looks like it weighs over 500g.

1236
01:20:08,160 --> 01:20:10,040
And her AP must be as thick as 8cm.

1237
01:20:10,370 --> 01:20:11,750
What should we do?

1238
01:20:17,300 --> 01:20:19,720
This liver seems too big for Ji-a.
It won't work.

1239
01:21:01,090 --> 01:21:03,550
This is the last and only way

1240
01:21:03,630 --> 01:21:05,010
to save the baby.

1241
01:21:06,470 --> 01:21:07,930
There's a lot of bleeding, doctor.

1242
01:21:08,010 --> 01:21:09,140
Would you like to try it

1243
01:21:09,720 --> 01:21:11,060
for the next surgery?

1244
01:21:11,140 --> 01:21:12,230
What?

1245
01:21:12,310 --> 01:21:13,730
I'm going to perform the surgery.

1246
01:21:13,810 --> 01:21:15,350
I'm so nervous.

1247
01:21:15,440 --> 01:21:17,190
I think you should give up.

1248
01:21:17,820 --> 01:21:19,440
It won't go badly, right?

1249
01:21:20,820 --> 01:21:23,070
It's too embarrassing if others find out.

1250
01:21:23,150 --> 01:21:24,860
Why is my life so hard?

1251
01:21:26,030 --> 01:21:27,990
What? It's fall already?

1252
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:30,120
Gosh, is fall here already?

1253
01:21:30,200 --> 01:21:31,950
Is something good going on?

1254
01:21:32,040 --> 01:21:33,580
You're always in a good mood lately.

1255
01:21:33,660 --> 01:21:35,960
-A blind date?
-Really?

1256
01:21:36,040 --> 01:21:37,500
Who is it?

1257
01:21:37,590 --> 01:21:39,130
Who is it that you're so crazy about?

1258
01:21:39,210 --> 01:21:40,840
Jun-wan, do I know her?

1259
01:21:40,920 --> 01:21:44,090
I'm Kim Jun-wan's friend, Lee Ik-jun.

1260
01:21:44,170 --> 01:21:45,970
The golf course there is really great.

1261
01:21:46,050 --> 01:21:47,640
The ball rolls in by itself.

1262
01:21:47,720 --> 01:21:50,220
An anonymous letter about bribery came in.

1263
01:21:52,390 --> 01:21:53,350
Did you go to play golf?

1264
01:21:53,430 --> 01:21:55,600
I heard the membership for the golf course

1265
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:57,860
costs two hundred million won.

1266
01:21:57,940 --> 01:21:59,440
Hey, you didn't go, right?

1267
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:01,110
Why? Is something going on?

1268
01:22:01,190 --> 01:22:03,650
