<b>- At Mapo-gu.
- Me? At Mapo-gu?</b>

<b>I wonder how he looked

32
00:05:48,217 --> 00:05:50,365
<b>He is handsome,

33
00:05:50,389 --> 00:05:52,936
<b>He has a small face
and is about 184 cm tall.</b>

34
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:55,610
<b>He has wide shoulders,

35

38
00:06:03,912 --> 00:06:05,488
<b>I decided to call him that.</b>

39
00:06:07,645 --> 00:06:10,927
<b>Mr. John Doe passed away on his way

44

45

<b>I invited him over.</b>

46

<b>Since the mummy from Donggang is

47

<b>The case has not been closed

48

<b>Do you think it makes sense
to give public access?</b>

49

<b>I'll call you next time. Sorry.</b>

51

<b>Is it okay if I see it from there?</b>

52
00:07:07,623 --> 00:07:09,786
<b>- Please leave now.
- I will.</b>

65

00:28:40,819 --> 00:28:43,775
<b>I will attach tendons to you
and make flesh come upon you...</b>

304
00:28:43,799 --> 00:28:45,305
<b>and cover you with skin.</b>

305
00:28:45,329 --> 00:28:48,892
<b>I will put breath in you,
and you will come to life.</b>

306
00:28:48,916 --> 00:28:52,083
<b>Even bones as small as dust are...</b>

307
00:28:52,107 --> 00:28:54,552
<b>recognized by the program
and magnified with a digital method.</b>

308
00:28:55,139 --> 00:28:56,349
<b>Let's take a look.</b>

309
00:28:56,373 --> 00:29:00,138
<b>Here are the cheekbones
and the contour of the jawline.</b>

310
00:29:00,162 --> 00:29:03,464
<b>- Should I sharpen the jaws?
- Yes, go ahead.</b>

311
00:29:07,006 --> 00:29:08,325
<b>Could these eyes be the one?</b>

312
00:29:09,553 --> 00:29:11,542
<b>Did he have double eyelids?</b>

313
00:29:14,233 --> 00:29:16,928
<b>I got it. This is the one.</b>

314
00:29:17,389 --> 00:29:18,484
<b>Oh, my goodness.</b>

315
00:29:19,881 --> 00:29:21,318
<b>Was he a celebrity?</b>

316
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:24,879
<b>There isn't any handsome celebrity
in his 20s who went missing...</b>

317
00:29:25,233 --> 00:29:26,633
<b>in the 1980s.</b>

318
00:29:27,116 --> 00:29:28,764
<b>Do it again.</b>

319
00:29:28,788 --> 00:29:31,313
<b>That's what I'm trying to say.
Is this even possible?</b>

320
00:29:31,337 --> 00:29:33,739
<b>There are only 53 pieces of bones.</b>

321
00:29:33,763 --> 00:29:36,419
<b>You can finish the symmetry...</b>

322
00:29:36,443 --> 00:29:38,384
<b>with only half of the face.</b>

323
00:29:38,408 --> 00:29:41,559
<b>More than half of the 53 pieces
are on the left side.</b>

324
00:29:43,803 --> 00:29:45,880
<b>Let's try it again, okay?</b>

325
00:29:49,131 --> 00:29:50,670
<b>Go find some more bones.</b>

326
00:29:50,694 --> 00:29:53,079
<b>I'm not doing this before that.</b>

327
00:29:54,358 --> 00:29:56,765
<b>And please, let me sleep.</b>

328
00:29:57,545 --> 00:29:59,149
<b>Geez.</b>

329
00:30:30,553 --> 00:30:31,966
<b>Don't you see the red light?</b>

330
00:30:32,616 --> 00:30:34,600
<b>- The red light?
- This traffic light hasn't...</b>

331
00:30:34,866 --> 00:30:36,826
<b>been showing the green light
for three months now.</b>

332
00:30:37,701 --> 00:30:41,116
<b>You're a medical school professor.
You're not color-blind, are you?</b>

333
00:30:41,741 --> 00:30:43,109
<b>I can't see only red.</b>

334
00:30:43,616 --> 00:30:45,177
<b>I can't see blood nor organs,</b>

335
00:30:45,201 --> 00:30:47,385
<b>so I'm destined to love bones only.</b>

336
00:30:48,928 --> 00:30:50,000
<b>It's off now.</b>

337
00:31:02,366 --> 00:31:03,755
<b>I have something to ask.</b>

338
00:31:04,248 --> 00:31:05,248
<b>What is it?</b>

339
00:31:05,694 --> 00:31:07,866
<b>If a body rots below the ground,</b>

340
00:31:08,444 --> 00:31:10,198
<b>does the color of the soil change?</b>

341
00:31:10,681 --> 00:31:11,681
<b>Pardon?</b>

342
00:31:13,014 --> 00:31:15,050
<b>You go to excavation sites a lot.</b>

343
00:31:15,787 --> 00:31:16,981
<b>I was curious.</b>

344
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:19,313
<b>I see.</b>

345
00:31:20,225 --> 00:31:21,927
<b>When a body rots in the soil,</b>

346
00:31:21,951 --> 00:31:24,131
<b>the soil does turn darker
than others.</b>

347
00:31:24,358 --> 00:31:27,205
<b>For remains of the massacre
from bullets or cartridges,</b>

348
00:31:27,229 --> 00:31:28,970
<b>the soil turns yellowish-brown.</b>

349
00:31:29,459 --> 00:31:32,118
<b>Why do you ask?</b>

350
00:31:34,147 --> 00:31:35,461
<b>What about the clothing?</b>

351
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:38,540
<b>Doesn't the clothing rot
when buried under the ground?</b>

352
00:31:38,662 --> 00:31:40,952
<b>For example, silk.</b>

353
00:31:40,976 --> 00:31:43,523
<b>If it's a basic soil,
silk will rot easily.</b>

354
00:31:43,547 --> 00:31:46,804
<b>If it's acidic,
cotton will rot more easily.</b>

355
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:48,405
<b>Why?</b>

356
00:31:50,873 --> 00:31:51,947
<b>I was curious.</b>

357
00:31:52,551 --> 00:31:53,551
<b>I almost forgot.</b>

358
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:56,733
<b>When does the exhibition with
the Andong remains I delivered?</b>

359
00:31:56,757 --> 00:31:59,186
<b>We're making preparations for it
tonight. Do you want an invitation?</b>

360
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:00,843
<b>You look like you need help.</b>

361
00:32:01,201 --> 00:32:03,438
<b>I'll get there by myself.
See you during the lecture.</b>

362
00:32:11,098 --> 00:32:14,785
<b>That's definitely an acidic soil
from the hills.</b>

363
00:32:34,329 --> 00:32:35,472
<b>What am I thinking?</b>

364
00:32:38,414 --> 00:32:41,349
<b>I'm Detective Joo, who called you.</b>

365
00:32:41,849 --> 00:32:42,688
<b>Prosecutor.</b>

366
00:32:42,755 --> 00:32:45,391
<b>Lim Hwa Young is said to have come
here all the time.</b>

367
00:32:45,458 --> 00:32:47,960
<b>She remembers vividly
seeing her...</b>

368
00:32:48,027 --> 00:32:49,829
<b>on the day of Lim Hwa Young's death.</b>

369
00:32:49,987 --> 00:32:52,508
<b>Do you remember the man
who'd accompanied Lim Hwa Young?</b>

370
00:32:52,532 --> 00:32:56,669
<b>I remember because the woman said
such odd things that day.</b>

371
00:32:56,836 --> 00:32:58,471
<b>I remember the guy's face too.</b>

372
00:32:59,216 --> 00:33:01,807
<b>But the woman was crying.</b>

373
00:33:02,008 --> 00:33:04,887
<b>At first, I thought that a handsome
man was giving her a hard time.</b>

374
00:33:04,911 --> 00:33:05,911
<b>She was crying?</b>

375
00:33:11,770 --> 00:33:13,763
<b>- Ma'am.
- Yes.</b>

376
00:33:13,787 --> 00:33:15,667
<b>- Could you give us soju?
- I'll be right there.</b>

377
00:33:19,404 --> 00:33:20,660
<b>- Here.
- Okay.</b>

378
00:33:28,634 --> 00:33:29,702
<b>It...</b>

379
00:33:30,892 --> 00:33:32,605
<b>cried too much...</b>

380
00:33:33,421 --> 00:33:35,341
<b>so I took it to the hospital.</b>

381
00:33:37,076 --> 00:33:38,711
<b>The doctor said it was
biliary something.</b>

382
00:33:39,578 --> 00:33:40,713
<b>What was it he said?</b>

383
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:44,617
<b>It cries all day long.</b>

384
00:33:46,886 --> 00:33:49,221
<b>It wasn't like a human being,
but an object.</b>

385
00:33:50,623 --> 00:33:54,460
<b>An object that shrieks loudly.</b>

386
00:33:56,891 --> 00:33:57,891
<b>I just wish...</b>

387
00:33:58,698 --> 00:34:00,533
<b>I didn't have that thing.</b>

388
00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:02,335
<b>I'd be so much better off.</b>

389
00:34:06,372 --> 00:34:08,474
<b>Biliary obstruction?</b>

390
00:34:09,402 --> 00:34:10,476
<b>I don't know.</b>

391
00:34:11,084 --> 00:34:12,278
<b>Maybe that's it.</b>

392
00:34:13,832 --> 00:34:15,348
<b>I really don't know.</b>

393
00:34:15,996 --> 00:34:16,996
<b>Why don't we...</b>

394
00:34:18,607 --> 00:34:20,019
<b>just drink?</b>

395
00:34:20,878 --> 00:34:21,878
<b>Cheers.</b>

396
00:34:30,223 --> 00:34:31,497
<b>Is that why you killed him?</b>

397
00:34:33,034 --> 00:34:34,229
<b>How did you kill him?</b>

398
00:34:45,745 --> 00:34:47,012
<b>But...</b>

399
00:34:47,629 --> 00:34:49,148
<b>I dressed him
in such good clothes...</b>

400
00:34:51,016 --> 00:34:53,586
<b>when I let him go.</b>

401
00:34:54,487 --> 00:34:56,322
<b>It was an expensive silk cloth.</b>

402
00:34:59,624 --> 00:35:01,293
<b>In his next life,</b>

403
00:35:03,202 --> 00:35:04,563
<b>I hope he won't have...</b>

404
00:35:06,081 --> 00:35:07,886
<b>a wench like me as his mother.</b>

405
00:35:13,278 --> 00:35:15,451
<b>I don't know if she made that up
to seduce the guy.</b>

406
00:35:15,475 --> 00:35:17,810
<b>She was talking such nonsense.</b>

407
00:35:17,977 --> 00:35:19,478
<b>Did they leave together?</b>

408
00:35:19,728 --> 00:35:21,981
<b>- What was the time?
- Let me think.</b>

409
00:35:22,615 --> 00:35:24,150
<b>It was around midnight.</b>

410
00:35:25,488 --> 00:35:27,586
<b>Oh, I remember.</b>

411
00:35:27,659 --> 00:35:30,055
<b>He took her out
when she was completely drunk.</b>

412
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:31,801
<b>I thought they were going
to a motel.</b>

413
00:35:31,825 --> 00:35:33,926
<b>But he grabbed a cab for her.</b>

414
00:35:36,715 --> 00:35:39,195
<b>We got the cellphone information
for Lim Hwa Young, Prosecutor.</b>

415
00:35:39,231 --> 00:35:42,034
<b>I looked through
all her recent calls.</b>

416
00:35:42,268 --> 00:35:45,404
<b>A man's phone number was
registered in a service app.</b>

417
00:35:45,978 --> 00:35:48,574
<b>The numbers are 010 8960...</b>

418
00:35:49,802 --> 00:35:51,911
<b>I called the number to ask
for a service.</b>

419
00:35:52,159 --> 00:35:54,146
<b>- Who was it?
- You should check for yourself.</b>

420
00:35:59,576 --> 00:36:01,420
<b>Namgung Ju Hye asked me
to give this to you.</b>

421
00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:04,500
<b>Oh, thank you.</b>

422
00:36:04,524 --> 00:36:05,925
<b>That'll be 50 dollars.</b>

423
00:37:27,468 --> 00:37:29,208
<b>The guy at the autopsy room?</b>

424
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:45,424
<b>This flower means eternal love.</b>

425
00:37:45,879 --> 00:37:48,027
<b>I bought it because it goes well
with the exhibition.</b>

426
00:38:04,741 --> 00:38:05,911
<b>Jung Sa Bin?</b>

427
00:38:15,815 --> 00:38:17,700
<b>Track the phone number
of the errand guy.</b>

428
00:38:17,724 --> 00:38:19,325
<b>I'll check with the mobile operator.</b>

429
00:38:20,881 --> 00:38:23,462
<b>It's not KR or LC.</b>

430
00:38:23,963 --> 00:38:25,598
<b>It's SKP Telecommunication.</b>

431
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:28,267
<b>There's a record of registering
in May 2015.</b>

432
00:38:28,466 --> 00:38:30,079
<b>His name is Chun Jong Bum.</b>

433
00:38:30,103 --> 00:38:32,905
<b>Born on February 14, 1998.</b>

434
00:38:33,205 --> 00:38:34,607
<b>Chun Jong Bum.</b>

435
00:38:36,181 --> 00:38:38,220
<b>Are there any suspects
other than Chun Jong Bum?</b>

436
00:38:38,244 --> 00:38:41,293
<b>The security at the victim's
studio apartment is poor,</b>

437
00:38:41,317 --> 00:38:44,727
<b>so we'll searching now to see...</b>

438
00:38:44,751 --> 00:38:46,552
<b>whether there were other suspects.</b>

439
00:38:46,885 --> 00:38:49,655
<b>But Chun Jong Bum is
the most likely at the moment.</b>

440
00:38:49,722 --> 00:38:52,992
<b>Track everything he did on the day
of the incident.</b>

441
00:39:24,768 --> 00:39:26,469
<b>When you see the remains
for the first time,</b>

442
00:39:26,493 --> 00:39:28,193
<b>I stare at it
just like you're doing.</b>

443
00:39:29,425 --> 00:39:32,831
<b>I do that until I can picture
his face as a living man.</b>

444
00:39:47,813 --> 00:39:50,249
<b>- Do you see it then?
- Sorry?</b>

445
00:39:52,008 --> 00:39:53,952
<b>You said you can picture him
as a living man...</b>

446
00:39:54,671 --> 00:39:56,989
<b>- when you see the remains.
- Of course, I can.</b>

447
00:40:01,833 --> 00:40:05,798
<b>My friend is a talented graphic
designer who restores the remains.</b>

448
00:40:07,263 --> 00:40:10,602
<b>I'm excited when a face is restored
on the dry bones like a flower.</b>

449
00:40:12,771 --> 00:40:13,906
<b>Even if you restore it,</b>

450
00:40:14,673 --> 00:40:16,308
<b>what meaning does finding out
the face...</b>

451
00:40:16,706 --> 00:40:17,843
<b>of a dead person has?</b>

452
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,515
<b>You are meeting with someone's life.</b>

453
00:40:24,556 --> 00:40:26,685
<b>Even if we live in different times,</b>

454
00:40:28,389 --> 00:40:30,389

<b>we can feel a connection.</b>

456
00:41:28,584 --> 00:41:29,982
<b>What's written on it?</b>

457
00:41:30,851 --> 00:41:32,467
<b>It's an ardent lover letter
of a wife...</b>

458
00:41:32,491 --> 00:41:34,219
<b>to her husband, leaving this life.</b>

459
00:41:34,723 --> 00:41:37,292
<b>I’m guessing she was a commoner

<b>The name is...</b>

<b>Yeon Yi's mother.</b>

462
00:41:41,835 --> 00:41:45,097
<b>It says that there were shoes
made from her hair at the grave.</b>

463
00:41:45,429 --> 00:41:46,665
<b>What does it say?</b>

464
00:41:47,727 --> 00:41:48,727
<b>Do you want to know?</b>

465
00:41:52,971 --> 00:41:55,040
<b>- "Look here."
- Look here?</b>

466
00:41:55,277 --> 00:41:57,442
<b>It's how they called each other
back in their times.</b>

467

<b>"Look here."</b>

468
00:42:02,347 --> 00:42:04,994
<b>"Do others care and

<b>"just as we do?"</b>

470
00:42:07,944 --> 00:42:10,165
<b>"Didn't you say that we'd die

<b>"but would you truly understand

474

<b>"Read this letter carefully,

<b>"so much left to tell you.'</b>

<b>I have a disease where I cry

<b>I get that you're a prosecutor...</b>

492

<b>I'm investigating the Pureun

<b>You know her well, don't you?</b>

496
00:44:31,516 --> 00:44:33,932
<b>Lim Hwa Young is the victim?</b>

<b>Why do you all react the same way?</b>

498

<b>I have a witness who saw you

<b>Do errand boys have a drink with

<b>That was the errand for that day.</b>

502

<b>I wouldn't think you need the money

<b>A person just died, yet

508
00:45:19,504 --> 00:45:21,780
<b>You're Chun Eun Woo.</b>

<b>Aren't you?</b>

510
00:45:25,957 --> 00:45:29,187
<b>You do so much using your

<b>You must be busy.</b>

512

<b>Where did you find the time

513
00:45:34,744 --> 00:45:36,828
<b>You should learn how to...</b>

<b>answer yes or no to questions.</b>

515

<b>I'm not the type to learn so easily.</b>

516
00:45:41,499 --> 00:45:44,169
<b>What did it feel like to spend three
days with a corpse?</b>

517
00:45:57,463 --> 00:45:59,518
<b>Gosh, you glaring me is terrifying.</b>

518
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:02,554
<b>It's just personal curiosity.</b>

519
00:46:03,031 --> 00:46:04,756
<b>Why don't you give it a try?</b>

520
00:46:06,419 --> 00:46:07,855
<b>You're a prosecutor after all.</b>

521

<b>There are tons of bodies in

<b>Thanks for the advice.</b>

523
00:46:21,773 --> 00:46:23,909
<b>I don't know if I'll feel

<b>It's me, Sung Hoon.</b>

525
00:46:43,362 --> 00:46:45,063
<b>Can we meet tomorrow afternoon?</b>

526
00:46:47,238 --> 00:46:49,000
<b>Darn it.</b>

527
00:46:51,506 --> 00:46:53,375
<b>(Seoul Seobu Police Station)</b>

528
00:47:01,749 --> 00:47:03,415
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

529
00:47:03,482 --> 00:47:05,484
<b>I couldn't sleep well.</b>

530
00:47:06,735 --> 00:47:08,153
<b>Oh, did you?</b>

531
00:47:08,186 --> 00:47:11,056
<b>You should talk to my lawyer
from now on.</b>

532
00:47:11,392 --> 00:47:15,293
<b>He's a famous human right

<b>You don't know him?</b>

534
00:47:26,029 --> 00:47:29,307
<b>There is only one body
that's assumed...</b>

535
00:47:29,607 --> 00:47:31,143
<b>to be killed by my client right now.</b>

536
00:47:31,483 --> 00:47:34,012
<b>It was an accidental murder too.</b>

537
00:47:34,104 --> 00:47:37,726
<b>We have him buying the murder weapon
on camera and it's accidental?</b>

538
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:38,783
<b>My client...</b>

539
00:47:39,450 --> 00:47:42,020
<b>bought that to fix his house.</b>

540
00:47:43,388 --> 00:47:44,388
<b>Anyway,</b>

541
00:47:44,893 --> 00:47:48,226
<b>I heard that you came up
with a scenario...</b>

542
00:47:48,426 --> 00:47:50,128
<b>where my client killed seven people.</b>

543
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:53,465
<b>Wasn't the body from 30 years ago...</b>

544
00:47:53,498 --> 00:47:55,600
<b>also fabricated by you?</b>

545
00:47:57,664 --> 00:47:59,337
<b>My client told me...</b>

546
00:47:59,467 --> 00:48:03,399
<b>that the body was buried
with a book.</b>

547
00:48:03,675 --> 00:48:07,012
<b>Then you blamed it on my client.</b>

548
00:48:07,546 --> 00:48:10,893
<b>Isn't this a classic case
of legal tyranny?</b>

549
00:48:10,917 --> 00:48:12,817
<b>Do you have proof?</b>

550
00:48:13,542 --> 00:48:16,688
<b>Bring me the body!</b>

551
00:48:17,331 --> 00:48:19,191
<b>If I'm the murderer...</b>

552
00:48:20,259 --> 00:48:22,661
<b>where's the body?</b>

553
00:48:23,505 --> 00:48:24,996
<b>The body!</b>

554
00:48:25,997 --> 00:48:27,332
<b>Do you understand?</b>

555
00:48:27,944 --> 00:48:30,569
<b>Have you gone deaf?</b>

556
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:43,048
<b>It's a personal curiosity...</b>

557
00:48:44,316 --> 00:48:45,917
<b>but your cat tattoo on your arm,</b>

558
00:48:46,419 --> 00:48:48,119
<b>- who is it for?
- What?</b>

559
00:48:50,713 --> 00:48:51,867
<b>A cat?</b>

560
00:48:51,891 --> 00:48:54,626
<b>You only killed women taller
than you, isn't that right?</b>

561
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:58,029
<b>Then again... Most women
would be taller than you.</b>

562
00:48:58,103 --> 00:48:59,598
<b>You scumbag.</b>

563
00:48:59,784 --> 00:49:02,767
<b>I feel like you would have been
beaten around by women.</b>

564
00:49:03,969 --> 00:49:05,971
<b>I used to know a guy back in school.</b>

565
00:49:06,448 --> 00:49:08,106
<b>He was a big boy...</b>

566
00:49:08,478 --> 00:49:10,008
<b>but he cried when the girls hit him.</b>

567
00:49:11,005 --> 00:49:12,944
<b>He even gave them money.</b>

568
00:49:14,779 --> 00:49:17,249
<b>But that guy went home...</b>

569
00:49:17,282 --> 00:49:19,251
<b>and beat his dog and his sister.</b>

570
00:49:20,884 --> 00:49:21,920
<b>Oh.</b>

571
00:49:24,115 --> 00:49:25,715
<b>Is that why you started
murdering people?</b>

572
00:49:26,258 --> 00:49:27,525
<b>Because a girl beat you?</b>

573
00:49:27,897 --> 00:49:29,427
<b>Why you son of...</b>

574
00:49:43,308 --> 00:49:45,377
<b>Find out who's paying for
Sung Hoon's lawyer fees.</b>

575
00:49:49,356 --> 00:49:51,249
<b>I'll scare him a little.</b>

576
00:49:52,772 --> 00:49:54,919
<b>It will push him to continue on.</b>

577
00:49:55,787 --> 00:49:56,787
<b>Kim Su Hyuk.</b>

578
00:49:57,827 --> 00:49:59,958
<b>He'll hurt himself even more
if he continues.</b>

579
00:50:00,822 --> 00:50:03,395
<b>Really? How will you do it?</b>

580
00:50:03,918 --> 00:50:05,463
<b>Are you going to cut him?</b>

581
00:50:05,536 --> 00:50:07,332
<b>Or pull him out?</b>

582
00:50:07,898 --> 00:50:09,701
<b>Or slash him?</b>

583
00:50:13,654 --> 00:50:15,307
<b>Did you really kill seven people?</b>

584
00:50:15,663 --> 00:50:17,208
<b>My mom always told me...</b>

585
00:50:17,642 --> 00:50:20,522
<b>that I should become the first place
and it didn't matter in which field.</b>

586
00:50:20,645 --> 00:50:21,645
<b>So I decided...</b>

587
00:50:22,247 --> 00:50:23,948
<b>to win against Gong Ji Chul.</b>

588
00:50:27,746 --> 00:50:29,087
<b>Crazy freak.</b>

589
00:50:39,576 --> 00:50:43,501
<b>Why can't I see even one letter?</b>

590
00:50:44,295 --> 00:50:46,304
<b>Not one single letter.</b>

591
00:50:51,731 --> 00:50:52,772
<b>Geez.</b>

592
00:51:04,701 --> 00:51:08,093
<b>This is a digital restoration method
that allows you...</b>

593
00:51:09,583 --> 00:51:13,221
<b>to shoot various lights
on the records to make...</b>

594
00:51:13,334 --> 00:51:15,099
<b>the volatile
and discolored records readable.</b>

595
00:51:16,101 --> 00:51:18,670
<b>If it's a 30-year-old record,</b>

596
00:51:19,342 --> 00:51:21,240
<b>the print may not come out,</b>

597
00:51:21,364 --> 00:51:22,674
<b>but the ink would show up.</b>

598
00:51:25,161 --> 00:51:27,529
<b>Wait. What is that?</b>

599
00:51:28,959 --> 00:51:31,451
<b>I don't know. It looks like a seal.</b>

600
00:51:36,881 --> 00:51:39,339
<b>I think we can find the identity
of the Donggang Mummy remains.</b>

601
00:51:39,363 --> 00:51:41,102
<b>We found crucial evidence.</b>

602
00:51:41,126 --> 00:51:44,062
<b>- Crucial evidence?
- You'll see if you come with me.</b>

603
00:51:44,677 --> 00:51:45,787
<b>Where are you?</b>

604
00:52:02,693 --> 00:52:04,449
<b>- Get in.
- All right.</b>

605
00:52:08,740 --> 00:52:09,803
<b>Fasten your seat belt.</b>

606
00:52:25,834 --> 00:52:28,314
<b>This is a seal of the bookstore
from the Donggang Mummy's book.</b>

607
00:52:28,522 --> 00:52:30,991
<b>I looked up "Old Future."

<b>All right.
Did the Donggang Mummy live?</b>

611

<b>He died 30 years ago.</b>

<b>Do you want to hurt the living
