1
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:49,250
<b>I'll do it too.</b>

2
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:53,390
<b>I'll be the person who stays...</b>

3
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:56,630
<b>for you.</b>

4
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:15,210
<b>(A Piece of Your Mind)</b>

5
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:17,610
<b>(Episode 8)</b>

6
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:28,630
<b>That's hot. Hot.</b>

7
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,310
<b>Store-bought seaweed tastes good.</b>

8
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,640
<b>I'm doing it because I want to eat it.</b>

9
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:47,580
<b>Want a beer?</b>

10
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:48,710
<b>Sure.</b>

11
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:02,290
<b>Where are the others?</b>

12
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:06,100
<b>Jin Soo won't be home until past midnight.</b>

13
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:09,470
<b>Min Jung goes to sleep as soon as her drama ends.</b>

14
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:11,900
<b>I don't know what she does during the day.</b>

15
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:19,910
<b>I haven't seen you in days, but you look tired.</b>

16
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,620
<b>I...</b>

17
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:31,460
<b>thought a little,</b>

18
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:35,860
<b>and I feel kind of pressured.</b>

19
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:37,360
<b>About what?</b>

20
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:41,270
<b>I feel like we'll have to get serious if we keep going like this.</b>

21
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:44,200
<b>The human psyche is a funny thing.</b>

22
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,400
<b>I didn't realize when it was just between us,</b>

23
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,810
<b>but now it's out in the open, it makes me think,</b>

24
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:52,310
<b>and I can't just love as I want.</b>

25
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:54,580
<b>Of course you can. What's the big deal?</b>

26
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,310
<b>But I can't.</b>

27
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:02,290
<b>Just how much am I supposed to think about?</b>

28
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,720
<b>Whether or not I'll marry this person,</b>

29
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:08,590
<b>whether or not he'll be a good father...</b>

30
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,860
<b>How can I predict that...</b>

31
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:13,960
<b>How can I predict that already and worry about it now?</b>

32
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,300
<b>If you like each other now, you keep loving them.</b>

33
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,000
<b>If you continue to like them, you get married.</b>

34
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,700
<b>Of course, you should think about the next stage.</b>

35
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,510
<b>What stage are we at now?</b>

36
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:24,610
<b>The state at which we think about the next stage.</b>

37
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:26,210
<b>What's with you and stages?</b>

38
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:27,810
<b>It's frustrating.</b>

39
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,980
<b>Isn't that only natural?</b>

40
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,380
<b>No.</b>

41
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:39,860
<b>Get to your point.</b>

42
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:42,060
<b>Don't beat around the bush.</b>

43
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:44,930
<b>Drop the concern about the future and stages and all that.</b>

44
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:46,960
<b>Tell me your point.</b>

45
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:55,770
<b>Let's break up.</b>

46
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,380
<b>This is all I thought about a few days ago.</b>

47
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:02,610
<b>Sorry. I just feel too pressured.</b>

48
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,790
<b>I'm home.</b>

49
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:20,500
<b>Are you enjoying some alone time?</b>

50
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,530
<b>I'll stop intruding then.</b>

51
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:32,710
<b>You're so noisy!</b>

52
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,370
<b>He was incredible.</b>

53
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:58,800
<b>Awesome.</b>

54
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,840
<b>Why are you here?</b>

55
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,140
<b>I live here.</b>

56
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:11,450
<b>Okay, I'm glad you're here. Let's talk. Sit.</b>

57
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,320
<b>The lease is up next month.</b>

58
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,030
<b>Renew it in my name for me.</b>

59
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,690
<b>You're leaving anyway.</b>

60
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:25,300
<b>- Who said that? - You did.</b>

61
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:28,430
<b>You said when you came that it was temporary.</b>

62
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,500
<b>You were only here because of Ji Soo.</b>

63
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:34,140
<b>Sorry.</b>

64
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:37,610
<b>It wasn't only because of that.</b>

65
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:39,880
<b>Are you going to stay?</b>

66
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:43,450
<b>Yes. I want to settle down here.</b>

67
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,880
<b>That's so out of the blue. Why?</b>

68
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,290
<b>I'm sleeping well.</b>

69
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:52,890
<b>Sure. You want to live where you've been living.</b>

70
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:55,260
<b>You don't need a reason. Let's live together.</b>

71
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:56,930
<b>No. It's uncomfortable.</b>

72
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:57,990
<b>You move out.</b>

73
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:59,500
<b>I'm speechless.</b>

74
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,300
<b>You know you'll do as I ask.</b>

75
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:07,200
<b>Are you okay living in Seoul?</b>

76
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,170
<b>Yes. I like my job.</b>

77
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:12,380
<b>I lifted up a musician who had hit rock bottom.</b>

78
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:15,780
<b>If he becomes more and more successful...</b>

79
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:19,720
<b>This is different from growing plants.</b>

80
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,150
<b>It's unbelievably worthwhile.</b>

81
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:25,120
<b>I think I like people in need.</b>

82
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:31,800
<b>- What? - Well,</b>

83
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:35,230
<b>I've noticed a few strange things about you.</b>

84
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,430
<b>You're...</b>

85
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:39,800
<b>He has a wife. He's married.</b>

86
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:43,840
<b>The thing is, his wife suddenly went on a trip one day.</b>

87
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,680
<b>She still hasn't come back.</b>

88
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,610
<b>That's what Mr. Kang says,</b>

89
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,180
<b>but who knows?</b>

90
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:51,010
<b>Maybe they already split up.</b>

91
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:52,920
<b>- Drop it. - Don't worry.</b>

92
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,420
<b>I'm not crazy enough to fall for a man like him.</b>

93
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:57,520
<b>I check every detail to see if he's free of trouble...</b>

94
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,860
<b>before I fall for someone.</b>

95
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:03,060
<b>But I haven't had this feeling in a long time.</b>

96
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:05,430
<b>I feel like I'm needed.</b>

97
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:08,600
<b>- When should I move my stuff out? - Take your time.</b>

98
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,000
<b>That's my uncle.</b>

99
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,100
<b>Here.</b>

100
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:14,770
<b>Thanks.</b>

101
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:44,370
<b>It's not the location either.</b>

102
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,780
<b>Are you going to work?</b>

103
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:03,720
<b>Good morning.</b>

104
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:06,560
<b>Eun Joo and that guy.</b>

105
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,930
<b>They broke up.</b>

106
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:34,150
<b>Eun Joo, I'm having lunch at home. Let's eat together.</b>

107
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:42,460
<b>Gosh.</b>

108
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:44,490
<b>You're here early.</b>

109
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,800
<b>I'm staying until this evening. Are you available?</b>

110
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:50,970
<b>Yes, I just need to step outside during lunchtime.</b>

111
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,800
<b>Will you play what we recorded yesterday?</b>

112
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,240
<b>Sure.</b>

113
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:03,350
<b>Where are you going, Seo Woo?</b>

114
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:05,750
<b>I'm going home. I'll come back after lunch.</b>

115
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:08,150
<b>- In the middle of work? - I need to go.</b>

116
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:28,140
<b>This is from yesterday, isn't it?</b>

117
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,260
<b>It's nice.</b>

118
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:52,160
<b>If you hadn't dragged me out of the car,</b>

119
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,000
<b>this wouldn't have existed.</b>

120
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:10,710
<b>Gosh.</b>

121
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:18,790
<b>You're really here.</b>

122
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,760
<b>I said let's have lunch together.</b>

123
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,330
<b>I'm so tired.</b>

124
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:31,030
<b>I only made one pack of noodles.</b>

125
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:33,700
<b>We can throw in some rice.</b>

126
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:37,470
<b>All right, then. I roasted some seaweed too.</b>

127
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:42,850
<b>I can finish two bowls of rice with just seaweed.</b>

128
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:52,520
<b>- Eun Joo. - What?</b>

129
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,390
<b>What's going on between you and Chang Sup?</b>

130
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:59,700
<b>He wants to end it.</b>

131
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,130
<b>Why that jerk...</b>

132
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,300
<b>Don't say that. These things happen all the time.</b>

133
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:09,070
<b>Are you okay?</b>

134
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:12,410
<b>I am. I'm not fazed at all.</b>

135
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:19,150
<b>What about work?</b>

136
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,750
<b>I came while working because I was worried about you.</b>

137
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,420
<b>Hurry up and eat then.</b>

138
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:35,470
<b>Can you come home early this evening?</b>

139
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,840
<b>I'm going to make refreshing small octopus stew.</b>

140
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:43,970
<b>I'm craving something energizing.</b>

141
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:45,810
<b>Sounds delicious.</b>

142
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:53,820
<b>Gosh, my stomach.</b>

143
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:02,360
<b>(Have a nice trip.)</b>

144
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,140
<b>Did you sleep well last night?</b>

145
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:15,810
<b>It wasn't because of the location.</b>

146
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,210
<b>So you couldn't sleep.</b>

147
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,150
<b>I'm going to find another reason.</b>

148
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:25,550
<b>What else could there be?</b>

149
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,830
<b>If we bring hands into her daily life,</b>

150
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,330
<b>will it help reduce her anxiety?</b>

151
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:46,600
<b>Most anxiety symptoms are caused by the increase of neurotransmitters.</b>

152
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,710
<b>Drug treatment is most important, isn't it?</b>

153
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:51,140
<b>Causes of anxiety...</b>

154
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:53,080
<b>are as diverse as people's appearances.</b>

155
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,710
<b>It might be better to conduct supportive therapy along with it.</b>

156
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:57,480
<b>Like how?</b>

157
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,920
<b>- Holding hands, for example. - Holding hands with whom?</b>

158
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:03,590
<b>The person whose hand she wants to hold.</b>

159
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:05,990
<b>As in, you want to build a hand?</b>

160
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:08,220
<b>- I'm for it. - No. We can use conditioning.</b>

161
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:09,730
<b>With a pattern.</b>

162
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:11,790
<b>It could be perceived as a human hand...</b>

163
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,660
<b>if a certain pattern and pressure are strong.</b>

164
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:18,600
<b>We'll build a model on the premise that she feels it via conditioning.</b>

165
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,700
<b>Like phantom limb syndrome.</b>

166
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,840
<b>Medically speaking, phantom limb syndrome is...</b>

167
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:25,110
<b>a person experiencing pain in a hand...</b>

168
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:28,340
<b>- that was severed. - It's similar.</b>

169
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:29,610
<b>- I see. - Approaching this...</b>

170
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:32,220
<b>as a problem in her brain rather than her hand...</b>

171
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,580
<b>She can feel like...</b>

172
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:36,690
<b>she's holding someone else's hand although no one's there.</b>

173
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,420
<b>- We can make a hand. - No.</b>

174
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,260
<b>Just the touch.</b>

175
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:45,960
<b>It may be effective for old patients with dementia if we combine this...</b>

176
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,860
<b>with a conversation program at nursing homes.</b>

177
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,400
<b>They feel great emotional stability...</b>

178
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,600
<b>just by holding someone's hand.</b>

179
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:54,500
<b>- Cappuccino for me. - Okay. One cappuccino.</b>

180
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,810
<b>Americanos for everyone else.</b>

181
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:59,610
<b>Send us more articles on anxiety.</b>

182
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:00,640
<b>Okay.</b>

183
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:10,450
<b>It might be able to make coffee...</b>

184
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:13,320
<b>according to my mood soon thanks to you guys.</b>

185
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:15,090
<b>That's our plan.</b>

186
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:17,190
<b>You need a hand to feel a touch.</b>

187
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:18,600
<b>Why are we making only the sense of touch?</b>

188
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,900
<b>Go ahead and try it outside.</b>

189
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,200
<b>It's moving fast. Nice speed.</b>

190
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,870
<b>It's working hard.</b>

191
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:27,670
<b>It's delicious.</b>

192
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:29,910
<b>- My gosh. - Good work.</b>

193
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:33,380
<b>It's time for Min Jung to post pictures on her social media page.</b>

194
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,510
<b>- She does it at 1pm all the time. - Really?</b>

195
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,410
<b>No.</b>

196
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:19,220
<b>Mr. Kang, why don't we take a short break?</b>

197
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:31,670
<b>I heard you got this plant as a gift.</b>

198
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,840
<b>I did.</b>

199
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,140
<b>Who gave it to you?</b>

200
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:45,250
<b>A friend of mine.</b>

201
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:47,750
<b>What kind of a friend?</b>

202
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:52,890
<b>I'm the only one who considers us friends.</b>

203
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:55,360
<b>She doesn't consider me one.</b>

204
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,690
<b>Why do you think it's just you?</b>

205
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,170
<b>Because I know how I feel.</b>

206
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:05,640
<b>I don't know how she feels.</b>

207
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:10,910
<b>She went somewhere far away,</b>

208
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:15,310
<b>so I have no way of knowing how she feels.</b>

209
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:26,520
<b>Mr. Kang, I don't think it's a bad idea...</b>

210
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:30,760
<b>to release a few pieces first before a full album.</b>

211
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,740
<b>Why is it so quiet?</b>

212
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:50,380
<b>He's back to...</b>

213
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:30,750
<b>Mr. Kang, it was nice just now.</b>

214
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:34,520
<b>Shall we continue?</b>

215
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:11,630
<b>Shouldn't we check the nerve reaction data?</b>

216
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:14,200
<b>I've requested them to collect the data.</b>

217
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,800
<b>I'll take care of the rest.</b>

218
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:19,870
<b>That's right.</b>

219
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:22,140
<b>What is he doing?</b>

220
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:28,040
<b>My gosh.</b>

221
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:44,530
<b>- Are you done? - Yes.</b>

222
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:46,260
<b>Good work.</b>

223
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:47,560
<b>I'm proud of you.</b>

224
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:06,150
<b>Are you going to stay longer?</b>

225
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,880
<b>No.</b>

226
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:14,160
<b>I guess you have trouble playing without Seo Woo.</b>

227
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:17,160
<b>We mix pretty well.</b>

228
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,730
<b>Hi, Eun Joo.</b>

229
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:27,060
<b>Yes, I'm coming.</b>

230
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,730
<b>I'm probably on my way.</b>

231
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:34,000
<b>Here?</b>

232
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:42,780
<b>Eun Joo, I'm coming.</b>

233
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:46,420
<b>You're on your way where?</b>

234
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:48,380
<b>Oh, gosh.</b>

235
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:52,050
<b>Did you lace the blanket with something?</b>

236
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:53,620
<b>It puts me to sleep.</b>

237
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:54,690
<b>Sleep some more.</b>

238
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,990
<b>It's okay.</b>

239
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:59,030
<b>I came to stay with you since I had some time,</b>

240
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:00,400
<b>but I have to go now.</b>

241
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:08,200
<b>You just got here.</b>

242
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:12,170
<b>Did you get some sleep?</b>

243
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:14,910
<b>I had a tiring day, so I should be able to sleep.</b>

244
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:20,320
<b>Something came up in the homestay, so I need to be with Eun Joo.</b>

245
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,680
<b>She's in the worst mood.</b>

246
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,920
<b>I'll come again.</b>

247
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,320
<b>I'm so popular these days.</b>

248
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,130
<b>Everyone needs me.</b>

249
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:31,660
<b>Mr. Kang wants me by his side when he plays.</b>

250
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:38,130
<b>You know he's married, right?</b>

251
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:39,600
<b>I do.</b>

252
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:49,110
<b>Why did you point out that he's married?</b>

253
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:50,680
<b>Don't tell me...</b>

254
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,780
<b>- That's not it. - Oh my gosh.</b>

255
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:54,020
<b>No way.</b>

256
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:57,420
<b>Has my 1 percent gone up to 20 percent?</b>

257
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:58,590
<b>I mean,</b>

258
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,360
<b>I feel like that guy Kang In Wook...</b>

259
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:05,130
<b>may be leading you and Soon Ho on...</b>

260
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:07,800
<b>It just went up another 5 percent. It's 25 percent now.</b>

261
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:09,230
<b>No, that's not...</b>

262
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:21,740
<b>25 percent...</b>

263
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,220
<b>Hi, Eun Joo.</b>

264
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:34,020
<b>Chang Sup keeps walking around, and I can't stand it.</b>

265
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,590
<b>He shouldn't come here now that we broke up.</b>

266
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:38,030
<b>Why did he eat the stew I made to cheer myself up?</b>

267
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:40,460
<b>I'm not okay. I'm not okay at all!</b>

268
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:55,210
<b>I haven't had dinner. I worked extremely hard.</b>

269
00:22:55,610 --> 00:22:58,580
<b>I slept a little, but I'm still exhausted.</b>

270
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:00,220
<b>So keep it short.</b>

271
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:03,250
<b>I'm thinking.</b>

272
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,720
<b>It's not over between you two, is it?</b>

273
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,920
<b>I mean,</b>

274
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:11,590
<b>whether to keep living here or to move out.</b>

275
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:13,530
<b>I'm torn.</b>

276
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:15,730
<b>Didn't you think before breaking up with her?</b>

277
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:18,300
<b>Hey, I wanted to stop dating her,</b>

278
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:20,600
<b>not move out of the homestay.</b>

279
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:22,240
<b>After settling the situation...</b>

280
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,470
<b>What are you talking about?</b>

281
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:26,140
<b>I'm starving.</b>

282
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:28,580
<b>I'm too tired to even argue with you.</b>

283
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:29,950
<b>Have the leftover stew.</b>

284
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:32,380
<b>Eun Joo's small octopus stew is the best.</b>

285
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:35,790
<b>Get out. Don't think, and just move out.</b>

286
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:04,710
<b>Something came up in the homestay, so I need to be with Eun Joo.</b>

287
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:06,220
<b>She's in the worst mood.</b>

288
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:15,390
<b>I ate it all.</b>

289
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:19,660
<b>Ate what?</b>

290
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:33,000
<b>It's not the exhaustion.</b>

291
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:51,950
<b>- Thank you. - Thank you.</b>

292
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:53,820
<b>- Goodbye. - Thank you.</b>

293
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:03,500
<b>Why are you moving your stuff here?</b>

294
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:04,830
<b>Because it's my apartment.</b>

295
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,040
<b>No, it isn't.</b>

296
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,540
<b>I told you it would become mine.</b>

297
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:13,440
<b>Let's go.</b>

298
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,780
<b>How do I...</b>

299
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:21,720
<b>Come in.</b>

300
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:23,850
<b>Soon Ho.</b>

301
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,500
<b>- Soon Ho? - Yes.</b>

302
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:36,100
<b>I changed it all to my name.</b>

303
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:37,930
<b>It used to be another name.</b>

304
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:42,670
<b>Uncle is finally moving on.</b>

305
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:44,770
<b>I'm sure...</b>

306
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:47,440
<b>he hoped he'd see Ji Soo somehow at some point.</b>

307
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:49,910
<b>But it's over now.</b>

308
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:52,850
<b>So I thought he'd leave Seoul, but he's settling down.</b>

309
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:58,590
<b>But he's definitely different from before.</b>

310
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,590
<b>He doesn't have that vagabond vibe anymore.</b>

311
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:03,930
<b>The funny thing is,</b>

312
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:07,230
<b>I was kind of disappointed that he was over Ji Soo.</b>

313
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,430
<b>Why?</b>

314
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:11,100
<b>He was always cold about love,</b>

315
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:14,170
<b>and became a real mess whenever he got into a fight.</b>

316
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:17,240
<b>A part of me felt like we need people like him too.</b>

317
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:20,680
<b>A human air purifier. I think I supported him subconsciously.</b>

318
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,010
<b>Of all the things to support.</b>

319
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:24,310
<b>What was that?</b>

320
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,580
<b>You should support him moving on.</b>

321
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:28,520
<b>Family should help with things like that.</b>

322
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:31,050
<b>What? Did you become his fan too?</b>

323
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:32,960
<b>Sure, he is all that.</b>

324
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:40,160
<b>- Should I put this here? - Yes.</b>

325
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:52,440
<b>Ji Soo?</b>

326
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,880
<b>- What about the device? - I got rid of it.</b>

327
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:01,020
<b>Ji Soo.</b>

328
00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:06,390
<b>- Seo Woo! - Yes?</b>

329
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:13,660
<b>Ha Won?</b>

330
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:19,130
<b>Let's go.</b>

331
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:22,500
<b>How many texts did Mr. Kang send?</b>

332
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:24,810
<b>I'm asking because I don't know,</b>

333
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:26,880
<b>but does he need you for rehearsals too?</b>

334
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,340
<b>No, not necessarily.</b>

335
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:32,380
<b>He keeps asking for you. It's weird.</b>

336
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,560
<b>Why did I take this?</b>

337
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:26,400
<b>Still.</b>

338
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:28,770
<b>Ji Soo...</b>

339
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:35,810
<b>Where are you?</b>

340
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:09,650
<b>Is that possible?</b>

341
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:12,510
<b>That would be awesome.</b>

342
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,380
<b>When you're nervous, it's so calming...</b>

343
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:15,850
<b>if someone holds your hand.</b>

344
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:17,590
<b>More so in hospitals.</b>

345
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:19,720
<b>It's nerve-wracking just getting a check-up.</b>

346
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:22,990
<b>It would be nice if someone would hold your hand.</b>

347
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,830
<b>That's it. We have to try it.</b>

348
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:30,930
<b>I wonder if you can feel it when no one's actually there.</b>

349
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:35,600
<b>Do this.</b>

350
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,540
<b>Close your eyes.</b>

351
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,320
<b>Don't open them.</b>

352
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:10,510
<b>Did you feel anything?</b>

353
00:31:11,810 --> 00:31:13,180
<b>I'm really dense.</b>

354
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,440
<b>Open your eyes.</b>

355
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,280
<b>I'm going to do this...</b>

356
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:22,550
<b>to your hand.</b>

357
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:27,360
<b>Close your eyes again.</b>

358
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:49,040
<b>It's because you're aware. You were conditioned.</b>

359
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:52,580
<b>It felt like you touched me.</b>

360
00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:01,320
<b>This is touching.</b>

361
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:00,550
<b>Are you listening to music?</b>

362
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,250
<b>It's nice.</b>

363
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:10,790
<b>I'm scared,</b>

364
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:14,230
<b>but it's beautiful.</b>

365
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,140
<b>The last song...</b>

366
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:27,140
<b>Ji Soo heard.</b>

367
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:09,150
<b>It isn't the location,</b>

368
00:34:10,450 --> 00:34:11,790
<b>and it isn't fatigue.</b>

369
00:34:14,090 --> 00:34:15,860
<b>I think I fell asleep...</b>

370
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:20,100
<b>because someone stayed with me.</b>

371
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:25,700
<b>Can you...</b>

372
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,970
<b>come stay with me now?</b>

373
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:35,740
<b>I want to see you.</b>

374
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:03,640
<b>I'll do that again.</b>

375
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,350
<b>Seo Woo?</b>

376
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,120
<b>Seo Woo.</b>

377
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:25,890
<b>Ji Soo.</b>

378
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:30,430
<b>If...</b>

379
00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:33,400
<b>If by chance...</b>

380
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,740
<b>Ha Won forgets you,</b>

381
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:38,740
<b>I'll...</b>

382
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,910
<b>I'll remember you more.</b>

383
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,730
<b>You should've told me if you were stepping out.</b>

384
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:53,840
<b>Seo Woo.</b>

385
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:58,210
<b>I can't drop it,</b>

386
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,680
<b>but I dropped it.</b>

387
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,660
<b>Shape up, will you?</b>

388
00:38:24,410 --> 00:38:27,440
<b>Something suddenly came up at the studio, so I couldn't go.</b>

389
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,750
<b>You're at the studio, right?</b>

390
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,760
<b>Yes.</b>

391
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:50,600
<b>It's fine, then.</b>

392
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:03,780
<b>I'll text you later. Sorry.</b>

393
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:14,320
<b>It's okay.</b>

394
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:16,930
<b>You can take your time.</b>

395
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:50,460
<b>Why are you sighing?</b>

396
00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:54,800
<b>Eun Joo.</b>

397
00:39:58,170 --> 00:40:02,270
<b>Even if I lock myself in my room, I hear Chang Sup.</b>

398
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:06,980
<b>I hear him walking, drinking water, opening the door, peeing...</b>

399
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:14,180
<b>I gave you half off for the room, so it's half mine.</b>

400
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:17,350
<b>Eun Joo.</b>

401
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:20,720
<b>The thing about love...</b>

402
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:23,590
<b>Shut it. Don't talk about love or life or garbage like that.</b>

403
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:24,630
<b>I don't want to hear it.</b>

404
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:29,630
<b>I have my physical tomorrow, so I'm drinking stuff to poop.</b>

405
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:31,900
<b>I have no energy.</b>

406
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:39,510
<b>Tell me why you were sighing.</b>

407
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:41,040
<b>Go on. Tell me.</b>

408
00:40:42,410 --> 00:40:45,950
<b>I guess it's because things never went well for me,</b>

409
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:49,150
<b>but whenever things seem to be going well,</b>

410
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:51,350
<b>I think of 100 reasons why it can't work.</b>

411
00:40:51,350 --> 00:40:53,050
<b>That's so you.</b>

412
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:56,290
<b>You talk about deflating things with such energy.</b>

413
00:40:58,630 --> 00:41:00,830
<b>Tell me 1 of the 100 reasons.</b>

414
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:03,500
<b>I feel like...</b>

415
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:08,470
<b>I stole a love someone else was supposed to receive.</b>

416
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:11,140
<b>Hey. Are you dating Chang Sup?</b>

417
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:12,510
<b>Are you insane?</b>

418
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:14,410
<b>Eun Joo, your hair.</b>

419
00:41:14,610 --> 00:41:17,410
<b>This? I used the gift certificate Soo Ji gave me.</b>

420
00:41:17,410 --> 00:41:20,580
<b>The owner gained so much weight since I saw her last year.</b>

421
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:24,390
<b>When I mentioned that, she said I couldn't use the gift certificate.</b>

422
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:26,420
<b>I'm sure she was offended. But?</b>

423
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:28,590
<b>So I said I was dumped, and she felt bad for me.</b>

424
00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:29,890
<b>She did it right away.</b>

425
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:33,190
<b>You did good. Good thinking.</b>

426
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,360
<b>What does he look like?</b>

427
00:41:37,170 --> 00:41:38,330
<b>The guy.</b>

428
00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:40,130
<b>The 100 reasons guy.</b>

429
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:44,270
<b>Hey, Won. Straighten your shoulders.</b>

430
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:47,440
<b>Straighten them like this.</b>

431
00:41:47,810 --> 00:41:49,710
<b>Yes, that's right.</b>

432
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:52,410
<b>Try pushing your bangs back.</b>

433
00:41:52,410 --> 00:41:54,580
<b>- My bangs? - That's right.</b>

434
00:41:56,250 --> 00:41:57,720
<b>That's right.</b>

435
00:41:57,890 --> 00:42:00,220
<b>You should let the light hit your face. Like me.</b>

436
00:42:00,890 --> 00:42:03,590
<b>For photos for documentation... Smile with your mouth closed.</b>

437
00:42:04,530 --> 00:42:06,790
<b>Okay. Good.</b>

438
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:08,100
<b>This isn't for a document.</b>

439
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:09,260
<b>Then what?</b>

440
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:12,100
<b>Why are you taking your picture if it isn't for a document?</b>

441
00:42:12,970 --> 00:42:16,070
<b>Someone asked me to send a picture of me.</b>

442
00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:19,670
<b>Who?</b>

443
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:23,540
<b>You always said you were busy, and I guess you were.</b>

444
00:42:23,950 --> 00:42:26,710
<b>Who asked you for a selfie?</b>

445
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:29,980
<b>A selfie...</b>

446
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:40,600
<b>I don't have any pictures.</b>

447
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,800
<b>Then why are you looking?</b>

448
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:48,200
<b>Do you have to go?</b>

449
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:52,210
<b>I... I need to use the bathroom. Darn it.</b>

450
00:43:11,930 --> 00:43:14,660
<b>I went to all the restaurants you told me to check out.</b>

451
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:19,770
<b>I finished the list of hot restaurants.</b>

452
00:43:20,870 --> 00:43:22,700
<b>Mommy ate at all of them.</b>

453
00:43:26,210 --> 00:43:27,780
<b>I'm done now.</b>

454
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:41,020
<b>These are 4 to 5 minutes pieces that I wrote.</b>

455
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:42,820
<b>Pick any one of them.</b>

456
00:43:43,190 --> 00:43:45,060
<b>We can record what you choose.</b>

457
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:53,100
<b>Here.</b>

458
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:57,610
<b>I tried jotting it down.</b>

459
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:02,580
<b>The impromptu piece you played in the concert hall before.</b>

460
00:44:02,910 --> 00:44:04,710
<b>You played it again yesterday too.</b>

461
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:30,970
<b>I liked it, so I had recorded it and written up the score.</b>

462
00:44:31,510 --> 00:44:33,110
<b>It should've disappeared.</b>

463
00:44:33,110 --> 00:44:34,140
<b>What do you mean?</b>

464
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:35,740
<b>This piece shouldn't exist.</b>

465
00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:39,910
<b>This can really help someone...</b>

466
00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:43,620
<b>when they're having a really tough time.</b>

467
00:44:45,190 --> 00:44:48,220
<b>Music saves the world, is that it?</b>

468
00:44:49,890 --> 00:44:51,090
<b>Yes.</b>

469
00:44:52,130 --> 00:44:54,200
<b>It saved me for a few seconds.</b>

470
00:44:54,930 --> 00:44:57,700
<b>At least for a few seconds. Definitely.</b>

471
00:45:01,970 --> 00:45:03,040
<b>Give me that.</b>

472
00:45:05,710 --> 00:45:06,870
<b>I'll play it.</b>

473
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:25,960
<b>An invisible touch that soothes anxiety.</b>

474
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:30,470
<b>I'm sure you'll figure out the technical matters,</b>

475
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:32,030
<b>but...</b>

476
00:45:32,770 --> 00:45:36,470
<b>people wouldn't use it only for medical purposes.</b>

477
00:45:37,410 --> 00:45:39,370
<b>Definitely not.</b>

478
00:45:39,770 --> 00:45:43,440
<b>There's a greater chance it'll be used improperly.</b>

479
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:50,380
<b>You'll make people feel something that isn't there.</b>

480
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:54,820
<b>You're very persistent.</b>

481
00:45:56,820 --> 00:45:58,090
<b>You're right.</b>

482
00:45:58,590 --> 00:46:00,730
<b>I can't seem to get free from it.</b>

483
00:46:04,170 --> 00:46:05,470
<b>I should though.</b>

484
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:08,200
<b>I won't do this one.</b>

485
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:11,140
<b>Are you sure you can decide that so quickly?</b>

486
00:46:11,910 --> 00:46:13,310
<b>I haven't even started yet.</b>

487
00:46:14,310 --> 00:46:16,540
<b>Thank you for everything.</b>

488
00:46:17,450 --> 00:46:19,150
<b>That's not good.</b>

489
00:46:19,150 --> 00:46:21,150
<b>It's not like I'm terminal.</b>

490
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:25,590
<b>A doctor shouldn't tell me what to do.</b>

491
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:28,220
<b>I came to say goodbye.</b>

492
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:30,420
<b>But I don't want to.</b>

493
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:34,200
<b>Where's Eunjoo Homestay?</b>

494
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:38,030
<b>- Does it really exist? - Thank you for your hard work.</b>

495
00:46:40,070 --> 00:46:42,040
<b>Let's meet on a personal level.</b>

496
00:46:43,340 --> 00:46:45,610
<b>We can eat together once or twice a month.</b>

497
00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:48,010
<b>I don't have any friends either.</b>

498
00:46:48,010 --> 00:46:49,440
<b>All I have are work and family.</b>

499
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,310
<b>I had no time for friends.</b>

500
00:46:51,550 --> 00:46:54,380
<b>Sorry, but I don't have the time.</b>

501
00:46:56,350 --> 00:46:58,620
<b>I'm leaving this city.</b>

502
00:47:02,590 --> 00:47:03,720
<b>Okay, then.</b>

503
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:07,030
<b>I'll just have to chat with your device.</b>

504
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:15,640
<b>It even has your personality. All except for one.</b>

505
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:17,270
<b>What?</b>

506
00:47:18,310 --> 00:47:19,370
<b>She's cheerful.</b>

507
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:23,410
<b>- Then she isn't me. - She's you exactly.</b>

508
00:47:24,010 --> 00:47:26,350
<b>You've just hit bottom right now briefly.</b>

509
00:47:26,850 --> 00:47:27,920
<b>Briefly...</b>

510
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:37,020
<b>Can I talk to her?</b>

511
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:38,230
<b>The cheerful Kim Min Jung?</b>

512
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:42,930
<b>It's against the rules.</b>

513
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:46,570
<b>The patient on whom the device is based...</b>

514
00:47:47,370 --> 00:47:49,070
<b>can't talk to it during the testing stage.</b>

515
00:47:49,570 --> 00:47:51,610
<b>I want to hear what nonsense...</b>

516
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:54,180
<b>the cheerful one says.</b>

517
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:56,880
<b>I know that.</b>

518
00:47:57,380 --> 00:47:59,850
<b>We can just take Min Jung out.</b>

519
00:47:59,850 --> 00:48:02,220
<b>We have to do it right now. That's the only way.</b>

520
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:04,050
<b>I'm in front of your office.</b>

521
00:48:20,910 --> 00:48:21,940
<b>Come in.</b>

522
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:27,750
<b>How can I talk to myself sober?</b>

523
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:29,480
<b>Right?</b>

524
00:48:30,110 --> 00:48:32,180
<b>It's not like it's therapy.</b>

525
00:48:34,050 --> 00:48:37,560
<b>From this point on, it's a social interaction.</b>

526
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:41,730
<b>Since we're friends now, not doctor and patient.</b>

527
00:48:42,130 --> 00:48:43,260
<b>So how about a drink?</b>

528
00:48:46,530 --> 00:48:49,470
<b>He invented this device.</b>

529
00:48:51,570 --> 00:48:54,270
<b>I can't do anything without his permission.</b>

530
00:48:55,170 --> 00:48:56,640
<b>Pretend he's not here.</b>

531
00:48:58,380 --> 00:49:00,010
<b>How can I, when he's here?</b>

532
00:49:00,710 --> 00:49:03,380
<b>Look at him. He doesn't even talk.</b>

533
00:49:04,350 --> 00:49:05,420
<b>He isn't here.</b>

534
00:49:06,220 --> 00:49:07,350
<b>Okay, then.</b>

535
00:49:10,650 --> 00:49:12,960
<b>- Cheers. - You too?</b>

536
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:14,990
<b>Just the toast.</b>

537
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:17,400
<b>I don't drink while I'm working.</b>

538
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:21,030
<b>He makes me uncomfortable.</b>

539
00:49:21,370 --> 00:49:22,630
<b>Should I turn it on or not?</b>

540
00:49:31,210 --> 00:49:32,340
<b>Okay.</b>

541
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:35,280
<b>I'm turning it on.</b>

542
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:39,120
<b>Here.</b>

543
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:46,460
<b>Min Jung?</b>

544
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:54,370
<b>Hello?</b>

545
00:49:54,830 --> 00:49:56,770
<b>You're the one who called me, so talk.</b>

546
00:50:11,780 --> 00:50:13,080
<b>Kim Min Jung.</b>

547
00:50:14,020 --> 00:50:15,020
<b>Yes?</b>

548
00:50:17,150 --> 00:50:18,660
<b>Why are you so cheerful?</b>

549
00:50:20,830 --> 00:50:21,930
<b>Why?</b>

550
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:28,370
<b>What is with that tone, like you have no worries in the world?</b>

551
00:50:32,970 --> 00:50:33,970
<b>Seriously.</b>

552
00:50:36,570 --> 00:50:37,640
<b>Why are you...</b>

553
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:41,650
<b>You're shameless.</b>

554
00:50:42,550 --> 00:50:46,120
<b>Why are you?</b>

555
00:50:46,550 --> 00:50:47,650
<b>Oh my gosh.</b>

556
00:50:53,260 --> 00:50:55,030
<b>Why do you live?</b>

557
00:50:56,260 --> 00:50:57,330
<b>What's wrong?</b>

558
00:51:03,430 --> 00:51:05,300
<b>You can't run to save your life.</b>

559
00:51:32,730 --> 00:51:33,830
<b>Mom...</b>

560
00:51:46,710 --> 00:51:47,780
<b>Mom.</b>

561
00:51:53,250 --> 00:51:54,290
<b>Mom.</b>

562
00:51:58,160 --> 00:51:59,190
<b>Mom.</b>

563
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:26,820
<b>No!</b>

564
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:29,150
<b>Eun Joo!</b>

565
00:52:33,660 --> 00:52:35,860
<b>No, please!</b>

566
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:40,200
<b>No, please. Please no...</b>

567
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,440
<b>Wake up.</b>

568
00:52:45,270 --> 00:52:48,070
<b>Please wake up. Mommy's here.</b>

569
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:51,280
<b>Mommy's here. Wake up.</b>

570
00:52:51,610 --> 00:52:53,240
<b>Please no.</b>

571
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:56,350
<b>Please...</b>

572
00:53:02,420 --> 00:53:04,820
<b>If only I had run a little faster...</b>

573
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:11,060
<b>If only... If only I had run a little faster...</b>

574
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:18,600
<b>If only... If only I had run a little faster...</b>

575
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:26,340
<b>If only I could've held her hand...</b>

576
00:53:30,410 --> 00:53:32,450
<b>If only I could've held her hand...</b>

577
00:53:33,220 --> 00:53:35,790
<b>If only I could've held her hand...</b>

578
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:40,420
<b>She was waiting to hold my hand...</b>

579
00:53:41,290 --> 00:53:46,360
<b>If only I had run a little faster...</b>

580
00:54:37,050 --> 00:54:38,050
<b>Thank you.</b>

581
00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:42,490
<b>I went home once or twice a month.</b>

582
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:45,960
<b>I was too busy with work.</b>

583
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:47,930
<b>- Hello. - I have a reservation.</b>

584
00:54:47,930 --> 00:54:49,260
<b>What name is the reservation under?</b>

585
00:54:50,630 --> 00:54:55,300
<b>My daughter checked my Instagram as soon as she woke up.</b>

586
00:54:55,670 --> 00:54:58,270
<b>The more likes I got, the happier she was.</b>

587
00:54:58,670 --> 00:55:00,970
<b>She nagged if I didn't eat a proper meal.</b>

588
00:55:02,910 --> 00:55:05,610
<b>Then the next day, I'd eat what she told me to,</b>

589
00:55:05,610 --> 00:55:06,910
<b>and take a picture.</b>

590
00:55:07,540 --> 00:55:11,280
<b>That's all I did for her.</b>

591
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:16,720
<b>I realized after my daughter died...</b>

592
00:55:17,590 --> 00:55:19,490
<b>that without her,</b>

593
00:55:19,660 --> 00:55:21,960
<b>everything was meaningless.</b>

594
00:55:22,590 --> 00:55:24,900
<b>There was nothing to work hard for,</b>

595
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:28,200
<b>nothing to live for... Everything was meaningless.</b>

596
00:55:28,830 --> 00:55:31,600
<b>I can't forgive myself.</b>

597
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:06,440
<b>If only I could've held her hand...</b>

598
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:28,490
<b>Didn't someone hold my hand earlier?</b>

599
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:32,730
<b>I felt like I could live.</b>

600
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:40,900
<b>Your bag.</b>

601
00:56:42,210 --> 00:56:43,240
<b>Thank you.</b>

602
00:56:47,540 --> 00:56:49,080
<b>- Have a nice day. - Have a nice day.</b>

603
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:53,220
<b>I came to visit someone.</b>

604
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:55,790
<b>Where are you going now? Do you want to go home together?</b>

605
00:56:55,790 --> 00:56:57,190
<b>No, I have to go somewhere.</b>

606
00:56:57,190 --> 00:56:58,860
<b>Can't you go with me just for today?</b>

607
00:56:58,860 --> 00:57:00,560
<b>I don't want to go alone.</b>

608
00:57:06,060 --> 00:57:08,570
<b>Go alone. Stop whining.</b>

609
00:57:09,930 --> 00:57:11,940
<b>It wasn't a woman's hand.</b>

610
00:57:20,580 --> 00:57:22,150
<b>What are you listening to?</b>

611
00:57:22,450 --> 00:57:24,580
<b>- Mr. Kang. - Right.</b>

612
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:27,120
<b>How does it feel...</b>

613
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:30,690
<b>to stay in the studio with Mr. Kang all day long?</b>

614
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:32,320
<b>What do you mean?</b>

615
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:34,060
<b>I'm just curious.</b>

616
00:57:34,060 --> 00:57:36,560
<b>You don't feel anything special, right?</b>

617
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:37,730
<b>No.</b>

618
00:57:38,330 --> 00:57:39,560
<b>Okay, then.</b>

619
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:42,270
<b>I only work when I work.</b>

620
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:43,670
<b>I said okay.</b>

621
00:57:44,940 --> 00:57:46,500
<b>I like someone.</b>

622
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:48,810
<b>When did you start dating?</b>

623
00:57:48,870 --> 00:57:51,680
<b>I'm not dating anyone. I just like him, that's all.</b>

624
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:52,880
<b>Isn't that the same thing?</b>

625
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:55,850
<b>I see. Is it one-sided?</b>

626
00:57:56,450 --> 00:57:58,980
<b>I like him,</b>

627
00:57:58,980 --> 00:58:03,320
<b>and I think he thinks I'm a nice person.</b>

628
00:58:03,450 --> 00:58:05,590
<b>It's similar, but it's completely different.</b>

629
00:58:05,590 --> 00:58:07,090
<b>It's night and day.</b>

630
00:58:07,090 --> 00:58:09,060
<b>It's not that extreme.</b>

631
00:58:10,830 --> 00:58:12,800
<b>I don't think it's just one-sided.</b>

632
00:58:15,670 --> 00:58:19,170
<b>If our dense Seo Woo is confused, it isn't one-sided.</b>

633
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:20,770
<b>Why do you think that?</b>

634
00:58:20,770 --> 00:58:23,410
<b>How do you think that? Why? Even I didn't think that.</b>

635
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:26,040
<b>Just because. I'm just throwing it out there.</b>

636
00:58:26,780 --> 00:58:29,380
<b>It's not like I can tell you to stop.</b>

637
00:58:29,750 --> 00:58:31,650
<b>It's employee management.</b>

638
00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:33,480
<b>You're always picking on me.</b>

639
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:34,580
<b>Are you mad?</b>

640
00:58:47,660 --> 00:58:50,200
<b>(Before Dawn)</b>

641
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:53,940
<b>Hello?</b>

642
00:58:54,710 --> 00:58:56,740
<b>Do you know the term "half-look"?</b>

643
00:58:57,370 --> 00:58:59,380
<b>Half-look?</b>

644
00:59:00,110 --> 00:59:01,650
<b>Do you look at only half?</b>

645
00:59:01,650 --> 00:59:03,580
<b>When I was learning Korean,</b>

646
00:59:03,580 --> 00:59:06,050
<b>I read Korean dictionaries and maps all the time.</b>

647
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:08,790
<b>It's a term I saw in the Korean dictionary.</b>

648
00:59:09,190 --> 00:59:11,050
<b>When a married woman...</b>

649
00:59:11,590 --> 00:59:13,490
<b>missed her mom,</b>

650
00:59:13,490 --> 00:59:16,190
<b>she'd go halfway and look at her briefly.</b>

651
00:59:16,190 --> 00:59:17,530
<b>That's what they called a "half-look".</b>

652
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:19,660
<b>That's an antiquated term.</b>

653
00:59:19,660 --> 00:59:21,600
<b>No one says that these days.</b>

654
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:22,970
<b>Let's do a half-look.</b>

655
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:24,400
<b>Together.</b>

656
00:59:26,340 --> 00:59:28,440
<b>You can walk 10 minutes,</b>

657
00:59:28,740 --> 00:59:30,310
<b>and I'll drive 10 minutes.</b>

658
00:59:31,070 --> 00:59:32,880
<b>The overpass will be the halfway point.</b>

659
00:59:33,940 --> 00:59:35,450
<b>Let's do a half-look there.</b>

660
00:59:35,650 --> 00:59:38,380
<b>I'm working, so I can't stay long.</b>

661
00:59:38,380 --> 00:59:39,950
<b>That's what a half-look is.</b>

662
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:42,990
<b>Looking briefly and affectionately.</b>

663
01:00:05,670 --> 01:00:06,840
<b>Hand.</b>

664
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:19,750
<b>Briefly...</b>

665
01:00:20,750 --> 01:00:22,060
<b>and affectionately.</b>

666
01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:31,300
<b>Okay.</b>

667
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:35,270
<b>You'll be busy tonight too...</b>

668
01:00:35,270 --> 01:00:37,140
<b>I'm not busy.</b>

669
01:00:37,870 --> 01:00:39,310
<b>See you later.</b>

670
01:01:12,270 --> 01:01:14,310
<b>No, no. This wasn't it.</b>

671
01:01:25,020 --> 01:01:26,720
<b>He asked me to stay.</b>

672
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:27,850
<b>Please stay.</b>

673
01:01:27,850 --> 01:01:29,560
<b>I said I'd stay.</b>

674
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:31,090
<b>I have to stay.</b>

675
01:01:34,530 --> 01:01:36,430
<b>Then I can just stay.</b>

676
01:01:36,660 --> 01:01:39,930
<b>He asked for help, and I just have to help.</b>

677
01:01:40,370 --> 01:01:42,900
<b>I can't go because I dropped the device?</b>

678
01:01:44,140 --> 01:01:47,270
<b>Why are you creating drama in your head?</b>

679
01:02:18,370 --> 01:02:20,170
<b>I cleaned up.</b>

680
01:02:26,450 --> 01:02:27,910
<b>I cleaned.</b>

681
01:02:32,550 --> 01:02:34,890
<b>You're good once you put your mind to it.</b>

682
01:02:40,890 --> 01:02:42,800
<b>Did you sleep here?</b>

683
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:46,400
<b>I go back and forth.</b>

684
01:02:46,770 --> 01:02:48,230
<b>It must be uncomfortable.</b>

685
01:02:48,470 --> 01:02:50,270
<b>I'm used to sleeping a few hours here and there.</b>

686
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:56,680
<b>I'm here...</b>

687
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:59,780
<b>because you asked me to help you sleep.</b>

688
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:01,650
<b>So...</b>

689
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:04,650
<b>Let's set it up first.</b>

690
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:06,620
<b>What was I doing?</b>

691
01:03:07,990 --> 01:03:09,190
<b>You were in the room.</b>

692
01:03:09,190 --> 01:03:13,390
<b>That's right. I was in the room, and you were on the sofa.</b>

693
01:03:14,860 --> 01:03:16,500
<b>Put your bag down.</b>

694
01:03:20,730 --> 01:03:23,900
<b>The door was open that time.</b>

695
01:03:23,900 --> 01:03:26,870
<b>We'll make it exactly the same.</b>

696
01:03:28,170 --> 01:03:31,410
<b>Let's make it exactly the same.</b>

697
01:03:32,750 --> 01:03:35,720
<b>What was the angle at which we saw each other?</b>

698
01:03:37,180 --> 01:03:40,650
<b>You slept there, and I slept on the sofa.</b>

699
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:42,490
<b>Yes, that's right.</b>

700
01:03:42,620 --> 01:03:46,560
<b>Okay, let's sleep then. Goodnight.</b>

701
01:03:48,130 --> 01:03:49,760
<b>Then when do we eat this?</b>

702
01:04:12,390 --> 01:04:14,320
<b>Where's that? That.</b>

703
01:04:15,190 --> 01:04:16,890
<b>- "That"? - Yes, that.</b>

704
01:04:16,890 --> 01:04:20,160
<b>The... That. The...</b>

705
01:04:20,390 --> 01:04:22,130
<b>I don't have that, so let's just eat.</b>

706
01:04:23,460 --> 01:04:24,500
<b>Okay.</b>

707
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:30,370
<b>Frying pan.</b>

708
01:04:30,940 --> 01:04:32,970
<b>"That" was a frying pan.</b>

709
01:04:46,650 --> 01:04:48,590
<b>There was a time when I didn't sleep for a month.</b>

710
01:04:49,660 --> 01:04:50,660
<b>Why not?</b>

711
01:04:53,560 --> 01:04:55,060
<b>Right before I left Oslo.</b>

712
01:05:18,850 --> 01:05:21,150
<b>It may seem strange to others.</b>

713
01:05:23,490 --> 01:05:26,290
<b>Not sleeping, not eating at mealtimes,</b>

714
01:05:27,330 --> 01:05:29,300
<b>not caring if the living room and bedroom are indistinguishable,</b>

715
01:05:30,300 --> 01:05:31,460
<b>not settling down in a place.</b>

716
01:05:33,030 --> 01:05:35,270
<b>That's how I am, and I'm used to it.</b>

717
01:05:41,910 --> 01:05:43,580
<b>It's the same blanket.</b>

718
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:46,780
<b>You said you slept well because of the blanket,</b>

719
01:05:47,750 --> 01:05:49,280
<b>because it crinkled since it was new.</b>

720
01:05:52,820 --> 01:05:55,220
<b>In the spring and fall, if it gets sunny out,</b>

721
01:05:55,220 --> 01:05:58,220
<b>Eun Joo and I hang the blankets out in the sun.</b>

722
01:05:58,860 --> 01:06:00,730
<b>I sleep the best on those nights.</b>

723
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:08,870
<b>I should hang a clothesline in the front yard.</b>

724
01:06:11,540 --> 01:06:12,640
<b>Let's do that.</b>

725
01:06:20,080 --> 01:06:22,420
<b>I'll leave once you fall asleep.</b>

726
01:06:22,750 --> 01:06:23,880
<b>I need to go.</b>

727
01:06:28,250 --> 01:06:30,660
<b>Things suddenly got busy at the homestay.</b>

728
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:32,360
<b>Timing is so...</b>

729
01:06:36,700 --> 01:06:38,730
<b>It's working. Go to bed.</b>

730
01:06:40,900 --> 01:06:43,340
<b>Go before I get sleepier.</b>

731
01:06:46,210 --> 01:06:47,340
<b>I'll walk you home.</b>

732
01:06:58,050 --> 01:07:00,220
<b>No one will use that blanket,</b>

733
01:07:01,150 --> 01:07:03,360
<b>so come whenever you want to sleep well.</b>

734
01:07:05,230 --> 01:07:07,260
<b>Since I can't go to the semi-basement.</b>

735
01:07:12,370 --> 01:07:14,670
<b>I can hear the thoughts in your head.</b>

736
01:07:19,410 --> 01:07:21,070
<b>It is what you're thinking.</b>

737
01:07:22,710 --> 01:07:23,780
<b>You're right.</b>

738
01:07:52,470 --> 01:07:53,810
<b>- Hey. - Yes?</b>

739
01:07:54,210 --> 01:07:57,140
<b>Tell me 1 more of the 100 reasons why it can't happen.</b>

<b>(Epilogue)</b>

<b>See? You won't let me go.</b>

742
01:08:04,350 --> 01:08:06,120
<b>You want me too much.</b>

743
01:08:06,450 --> 01:08:08,660
<b>It's just for today. I only need you today.</b>

744
01:08:08,660 --> 01:08:10,120
<b>I won't need you starting tomorrow.</b>

745

<b>I don't want to be alone today.</b>

746

<b>I'm scared.</b>

<b>(A Piece of Your Mind)</b>

<b>Was it intentional?</b>

752
01:09:02,940 --> 01:09:04,810
<b>Stopping midway and looking only briefly.</b>

<b>Yes.</b>

<b>What was your daughter's name?</b>

<b>You know, a noose hanging from the ceiling.</b>

756

<b>What?</b>

<b>Ji Soo?</b>

<b>Someone was just here.</b>

<b>I'll make an exception and listen to you.</b>
