1
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:16,230
JEONG TAE-EUL

2
00:00:16,310 --> 00:00:18,110
I'm bored, let's play pool.

3
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:25,030
EPISODE 5

4
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:29,040
Thank you for your kindness.

5
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:31,330
I should repay you in cash,

6
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:34,210
but our worlds had different bills,
so I got you goods instead.

7
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:39,960
I hope you can get a satisfactory price.

8
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:46,840
Where did you get this?

9
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:48,930
Did you find oil in your yard
or something?

10
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,110
Oh, Sin-jae.

11
00:00:58,190 --> 00:00:59,860
Can I get a sweet milk tea?

12
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:03,150
I guess Squad Three is off duty tomorrow.

13
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,070
Yes, I was thinking of playing pool.

14
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,160
I don't see the horse that was here.

15
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,490
Maximus? It's been gone for a while.

16
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:16,830
Everyone's been asking,
so I even wrote it on the sign out front.

17
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,720
But Tae-eul isn't here.

18
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,090
Who are you playing pool with?

19
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:30,640
-She's not here?
-Maybe she's back.

20
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:33,890
She left with that King guy a while ago.

21
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:39,190
THE HORSE ISN'T HERE

22
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:49,320
I'M BORED, LET'S PLAY POOL

23
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,370
Head Court Lady Noh, it's me.

24
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:56,040
His Majesty just came back,
and he has a guest.

25
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:00,290
It's a woman.

26
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,130
Tell His Majesty to take a detour,

27
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,220
and use the sea route.

28
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,550
He shouldn't be seen by people.

29
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:13,220
Don't worry about the palace,
I'll make sure nobody talks.

30
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:23,610
FOUR TIGER SWORD

31
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:36,660
I'm the King of the Kingdom of Corea.

32
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:41,460
And my name, which you cannot say,

33
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,010
is Lee Gon.

34
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:55,100
So

35
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:57,890
you do have a name.

36
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:04,110
If you really have a name,

37
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:08,320
I guess there's no way
to avoid a beheading now.

38
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:15,080
From the way you talked to me so far,
it's only right to behead you right away.

39
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,500
-I'll escort you to the palace.
-Let me take care of Maximus first.

40
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:26,420
The trip had been too long for her age.

41
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:28,710
Come to the racetracks.

42
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,010
Withdraw the guards from the racetracks
right now.

43
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:38,470
Two of you go to the control room
and get the security footage.

44
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,480
The rest, follow me.

45
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,630
What is this place?

46
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:11,090
Is it some kind of a fourth dimension?

47
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:13,550
I'm not sure yet.

48
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:17,470
I guess we can say it's something between
1 and 0 in my world and yours.

49
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:21,520
This is a place that cannot be
explained scientifically.

50
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,610
Do you see that balloon?

51
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:31,400
Balloons usually pop within ten hours.

52
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:34,780
But that one has been floating
like that for over ten days.

53
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:37,910
It hasn't popped or floated away.

54
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,620
It's exactly where I let it go.

55
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:45,120
That means there's no light,
wind or air here.

56
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,040
Isn't that amazing?

57
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:49,000
If it's not science, what is it?

58
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:52,670
Is it some kind of magic?

59
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:55,760
It could be a part of a legend.

60
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,390
Time flows differently here as well.

61
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:02,140
One minute here is about an hour outside.

62
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:04,390
My watch stops here,

63
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:06,150
so I went back and forth
for several days to check.

64
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:11,030
How could you check when clocks stop here?

65
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,030
I used Euler's number.

66
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:18,030
I don't know how deep

67
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,540
or how vast this place is.

68
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,080
I'll reach the edge of this place someday.

69
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:26,750
And I'll tell you

70
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:28,670
all about it.

71
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:30,880
But for today, let's go to my world.

72
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:48,310
Lady Maximus has a lower blood pressure
than last time,

73
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,900
but it's still within a normal range.

74
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:53,820
"Lady"?

75
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,740
A horse is called a lady...

76
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,780
I will do another thorough checkup
in the morning, Your Majesty.

77
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:02,540
Please do.

78
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:16,010
I told you so. Everything I said to you
was true, wasn't it?

79
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:20,180
Don't you see that's driving me crazy?

80
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:23,220
If this is all real, it's terrifying.

81
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:26,180
And if it's not, that means I'm crazy.

82
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:27,480
You should watch your manners.

83
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,190
And that face.

84
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:30,770
He is supposed to be on my side.

85
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,020
He's been on my side since I was three.

86
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,650
Is that gun real?

87
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,700
Can I take a look at it?

88
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:47,040
She knows how to handle it. Let her be.

89
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:49,830
She has to see for herself to believe it.

90
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,080
Believe what?

91
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,500
That she just crossed between 1 and 0.

92
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,100
No way.

93
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:07,680
This is real?

94
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:09,810
This P30

95
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:12,350
is actually real?

96
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:17,070
I'm going to check something.

97
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:19,570
It's nothing personal.

98
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:33,210
I told you. She can handle guns.

99
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:35,880
I'm letting this go just this once
because you're His Majesty's guest.

100
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,760
So...

101
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:40,380
This country...

102
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:42,380
And you being the King.

103
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:44,760
It's all real?

104
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:46,350
It's all real.

105
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:50,850
That gun, this world, and me.

106
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,310
So don't think of confirming that
by pulling the trigger.

107
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:58,610
This guy isn't going to move an inch.

108
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:01,400
Loosen your grip

109
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,570
unless you want to get killed.

110
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:21,220
Your Majesty, is she...

111
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,300
Yes.

112
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,800
She's Lieutenant Jeong Tae-eul.

113
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,510
Do you

114
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:30,270
know me as well?

115
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:55,290
Welcome to my palace.

116
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:11,390
This is Gwangyeongjeon.

117
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:12,980
It's my private residence.

118
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:15,480
Make yourself at home...

119
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,230
Did you really have to do this?

120
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:25,650
Are you trying to worry me to death?

121
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,620
Head Court Lady Noh...

122
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:30,530
I think it has only been
about 10 minutes and 50 seconds

123
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:32,750
since she believed I'm a king.

124
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:37,210
She's the important person who knows

125
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,340
where the buttons came from.

126
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:44,630
It's nice to meet you. I'm--

127
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,760
Put all your belongings here in the box.

128
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:55,020
Everyone has to go through
a security check when entering the palace.

129
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:58,810
Everyone including the court ladies
and even the Prime Minister.

130
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:05,990
You reap what you sow.

131
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,750
You're giving them back
to me later, right?

132
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:24,960
I'll be penalized
if I lose my ID card again.

133
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:29,930
You recognize her face, right?

134
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:32,760
You're right.

135
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:38,480
Do I have to get frisked now?

136
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,060
We'll skip that.

137
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:41,940
I should trust you.

138
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,360
You're my King's guest.

139
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,160
Let me talk to you for a moment.

140
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:51,620
Now?

141
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,870
I'm sure you want to talk later.

142
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:02,000
But I also would have liked it
if you had left the palace later

143
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:07,420
and brought a guest according
to the right procedures later.

144
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:12,180
There were five guards and one person
at the stable who saw her.

145
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:15,720
Twelve court ladies who would be
suspicious of being

146
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:17,390
-dismissed suddenly--
-I was on my way.

147
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:21,350
I needed to talk now anyway.

148
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,530
You should leave, too.

149
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,650
It's a King's order.

150
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,410
Don't worry.

151
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,370
Just wait here.

152
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:45,540
I'll ditch her somehow and come back.

153
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:48,090
My goodness...

154
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:50,590
You're really asking for it, aren't you?

155
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,180
I mean,

156
00:11:57,970 --> 00:11:58,930
Your Highness.

157
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,020
I guess that was the wrong thing to say.

158
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:10,440
She really believes it now.

159
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,740
That I'm the King.

160
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:26,460
My goodness, my head.

161
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,250
Oh, my heart.

162
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,550
My goodness.

163
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:10,630
You have a meeting at 8 a.m.
regarding the 25th anniversary

164
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:12,420
of your coronation with the staff.

165
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:16,340
And you have an appointment for tea
at 10 a.m. with press company CEOs,

166
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:18,600
then you must make the first throw
at the basketball

167
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,010
season-opening ceremony at 1 p.m.

168
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,060
Hang on.

169
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:23,640
I left the palace for just half a day,

170
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:25,600
and I have that many things to do?

171
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:29,150
Maybe someone in the court
has a grudge on you.

172
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:33,530
-Is there more?
-Yes.

173
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:35,900
You have a speech to deliver at 2 p.m.

174
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:37,450
at the International Congress of
Mathematicians.

175
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:40,870
Then there is a flood relief supply
delivery ceremony at 4 p.m.

176
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:42,870
You can go there by helicopter.

177
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:44,040
All right.

178
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:45,710
I'll do all that,

179
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:47,580
so please let me eat dinner freely.

180
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,550
It's always suspicious
when you do something on your own.

181
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:53,260
You're crossing the line now.

182
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:55,840
I'll be eating by myself in the study.

183
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,970
Alone.

184
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:03,390
There is a guest in His Majesty's study.

185
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:06,270
You must keep that guest

186
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:09,310
locked up in there
until I give other orders.

187
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,580
Ironically, my first duty as a king

188
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:30,960
was to carry out
the funeral of the former king.

189
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:32,630
It was when I was eight.

190
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,690
I'm positive now

191
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:50,940
that it's a parallel universe.

192
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:53,940
Pardon?

193
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,400
Na-ri.

194
00:14:58,070 --> 00:14:58,950
Myeong Na-ri.

195
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:00,910
Who's Myeong Na-ri?

196
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:05,040
I'm Myeong Seung-a
from the Royal Public Affairs Office.

197
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:17,630
I know it won't be true,

198
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:19,930
but I just want to make sure.

199
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,260
Don't you own a building?

200
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:25,260
Didn't you rent it out
to a Taekwondo center?

201
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:31,520
I do own buildings,
but they're all in Canada.

202
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:34,650
Would you like some tea?

203
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:36,530
It's herb tea that will help you
have a good night's sleep.

204
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:43,200
You want me to fall asleep?

205
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:44,780
I'd be grateful if you could.

206
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:46,910
I came here to keep an eye on you,

207
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:50,500
and you won't be able to leave
until Head Court Lady Noh says otherwise.

208
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:52,710
It will be easy for both of us
if you sleep.

209
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,630
You're really straightforward,

210
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,460
just like Na-ri.

211
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,590
I...

212
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:06,560
Can I use that laptop over there?

213
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:09,600
Of course not. You can't use His Majesty's
laptop without his permission.

214
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:15,900
-It's the year 2019 here, right?
-Yes.

215
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:18,780
And was this room's owner born in 1987?

216
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,360
Of course.

217
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,990
And the cultural capital is Busan,

218
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:25,490
and there are 63 buildings
called 63 Building.

219
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:27,370
There's only one 63 Building
in Yeouido, Seoul.

220
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:28,290
That little jerk.

221
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:31,290
Did you just swear at me?

222
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:37,880
What would be the better answer?

223
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:45,140
Can I have alcohol instead of tea?

224
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:47,970
I'd love some soju.

225
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:54,270
Your Majesty, where did you go this time?

226
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:56,770
A parallel universe.

227
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,130
Why do you need a laptop?

228
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:29,430
I wanted to look some stuff up
on the internet.

229
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:36,140
It's a business phone,
so I can't lend it to you.

230
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:39,360
But if you tell me,
I'll read out the search results for you.

231
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,900
I guess that will work.

232
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:45,700
All right. Then...

233
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:47,570
Lee Gon.

234
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:52,490
What did you just say?

235
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:53,870
Lee Gon.

236
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:57,080
Isn't the King's name Lee Gon?

237
00:17:57,170 --> 00:17:58,130
Have you lost your mind?

238
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:01,420
Are you just casually
calling the King's name like that?

239
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:06,470
You don't even know the 63 Building,
and you don't know the King's age.

240
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:11,140
Who in the world are you?

241
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,890
Oh, did you live abroad for a long time?

242
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,980
But even so,

243
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:18,230
how could you be so indifferent
toward your home country?

244
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:20,150
Well...

245
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:23,150
This isn't my home country.

246
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:29,160
Well, my earth is still flat for me
so I can't explain.

247
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:32,700
Let's just say I'm an illegal immigrant.

248
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:35,870
Oh, my gosh.

249
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:45,800
Can you leave us? It won't take long.

250
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:55,220
She's an illegal immigrant.

251
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:02,360
Why are you smiling?

252
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:05,320
I know someone who looks like you,
but you're so different from him.

253
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:06,650
I'm sorry about earlier.

254
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:10,240
But were you always like this?

255
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:13,490
So prudent and serious?

256
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:15,490
Hold this.

257
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:19,160
I understand how you feel.
I went through that too.

258
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:37,520
I thought you'd need it,
so I made it easy for you.

259
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,310
I'm sure you won't find anything, though.

260
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:43,100
You can ask your boss why.

261
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,820
He's a science guy,
so he'd be better at explaining.

262
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:50,780
Are you

263
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:54,370
from a parallel universe?

264
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,410
Where the capital is Seoul,

265
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:59,580
and the country's name
is the Republic of Korea?

266
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:02,710
How do you know that?

267
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:08,460
Who are you?

268
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,630
What have you done to His Majesty?

269
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:15,260
Did you make that weird scar
on his shoulder too?

270
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:18,060
He has a scar on his shoulder?

271
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:22,980
I don't know anything about that.

272
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:25,860
We're not close enough to show
each other's backs.

273
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:29,610
And don't talk to me like that.

274
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:32,200
You were born in 1991, right?
I'm a year older than you.

275
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:37,990
Captain Jo.

276
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,060
I said I wanted the halls empty.

277
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:06,150
Your Majesty, I wanted to ask a few--

278
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:09,020
I know. I know you're curious

279
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:11,360
and I understand why you want
to check her fingerprints.

280
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,070
I'll send you a link.

281
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,990
It's about quantum mechanics.

282
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:17,740
Send me your questions by text
after reading it.

283
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:21,660
And will you open the door now?
The food is getting cold.

284
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:24,370
But Your Majesty.

285
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,170
Didn't you get any alcohol?

286
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:31,460
Your guest was asking for some.

287
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:35,300
Yeong.

288
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:36,340
Yes, Your Majesty.

289
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:40,470
Will you find out where the alcohol fridge
is located in the palace?

290
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:42,470
Pardon?

291
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,400
By the way,

292
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:51,070
when do you think His Majesty saw me?

293
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:53,650
I greeted him,

294
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:57,450
but he said we'd met before
and that he was glad to see me.

295
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:00,830
I had never met him before.

296
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:06,660
Was there anything notable
about the woman in there?

297
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:09,000
-Except that she asked for alcohol.
-You shouldn't ask me.

298
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,630
I'm only going to report
to Head Court Lady Noh.

299
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,760
You're good at your job.

300
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,130
I feel so sad about

301
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:19,720
missing this great opportunity.

302
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:23,260
I have to go meet Head Court Lady Noh.

303
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,140
I'll be off, then.

304
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:39,450
-Did you just lock me up in here?
-I'm housing you.

305
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:41,070
So be understanding.

306
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:43,990
I brought you here
without saying anything.

307
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:47,660
Everyone's in a panic
because this has never happened before.

308
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:49,170
Why are you so calm, then?

309
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:53,040
I imagined bringing you here
lots of times before.

310
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:54,550
Although it wasn't like this.

311
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,300
Did you make a contract or something?
Did you buy land?

312
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,560
I stopped myself from wiping it
on the wall because of your citizens.

313
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:09,140
You should promote that employee
who was watching me.

314
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:10,270
She's a real patriot.

315
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,610
Let me borrow your phone,
and give it to me unlocked.

316
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:15,940
She wouldn't lend me her phone.

317
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:18,240
What are you going to look up?

318
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:20,450
I'm sure you have nowhere to call.

319
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:23,160
None of your business.

320
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:24,330
What's your passcode?

321
00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:26,410
Who would even try to look
through a King's phone?

322
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:27,450
It's not locked.

323
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:35,090
Pass me the snack.

324
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:36,590
It's not a snack, it's dinner.

325
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:39,880
I thought you would be hungry.

326
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,510
You try it first.

327
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,810
-What?
-I'm not joking.

328
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:50,100
I'm Alice in Wonderland right now.

329
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:53,560
She eats weird pills
and grows bigger and smaller and stuff.

330
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:56,570
What if I eat this and die from poisoning
or natural causes and stuff?

331
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:58,990
Don't worry.

332
00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:01,740
I keep my promises.
You'll die from a beheading.

333
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:04,660
All right, then.

334
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:06,080
I'll enjoy the food.

335
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:16,750
You made this yourself?

336
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,510
Yes. Is it good?

337
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:21,300
No, it's bad.

338
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:28,100
I haven't done this for about 25 years,

339
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,140
but I should call my officials today.

340
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:33,390
In this world,
if I say "Anyone out there?",

341
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,810
everyone will come rushing...

342
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:39,150
Oh, gosh.

343
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:45,910
Were you really standing outside the door?

344
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:48,620
Do you think I have
that much time on my hands?

345
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51,700
And you were here this whole time?

346
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:53,460
No, I came just a minute ago.

347
00:24:54,670 --> 00:24:55,880
I barely sat down.

348
00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:00,960
I prepared a bedroom and a meal
for your guest,

349
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:05,720
but since she seems to have eaten,
I will escort her to her room.

350
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:09,890
It is the farthest room from your room,
Your Majesty.

351
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:22,690
I'll see you tomorrow. Get some sleep.

352
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:30,620
I was talking to you.

353
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:33,250
You should really sleep well.

354
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:40,040
Is it far to the right
or to the left from my room?

355
00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:42,630
My goodness!

356
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:55,730
Besides emergency situations,

357
00:25:56,850 --> 00:25:58,810
outsiders hardly ever stay

358
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,980
in the palace overnight.

359
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:06,900
So you must never speak
about what happened today

360
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:08,610
anywhere or to anyone.

361
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:14,290
You must keep everything a secret,
such as the structure of the palace

362
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:17,710
or the private conversations
you've had with the King.

363
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:20,080
You don't need to worry about that.

364
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:22,460
I'm a government official, too.

365
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:23,960
So I've seen.

366
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:27,760
Lieutenant Jeong Tae-eul.

367
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,680
I've been meaning to ask this.

368
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,890
How do you people

369
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,230
know me?

370
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:43,190
A lieutenant in the police force?

371
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:47,200
It is very strange.

372
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:53,490
His Majesty has had a strange ID card
since he was young.

373
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:59,830
There was no police officer named
Jeong Tae-eul in the Kingdom of Corea,

374
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:05,170
and there is no such rank
as a lieutenant in the police force here.

375
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:11,760
I thought that it was a fake ID
made as a joke or for some other reason,

376
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,890
but that nonexistent person

377
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:16,770
suddenly appeared here.

378
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,140
It's shocking.

379
00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:24,730
Everything is just absurd,

380
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:27,150
but there is one thing I'm sure about.

381
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:32,320
An existence that cannot be explained
will only bring chaos to the world,

382
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:34,620
and it will only harm our King.

383
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:36,830
So

384
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:39,210
during your stay here,

385
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:43,630
please try to avoid contact

386
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:48,420
with anyone besides the King,
the Chief of the Royal Guard, and me.

387
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:53,760
Furthermore,
don't get curious about this world,

388
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:56,180
and don't try to stay.

389
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:00,940
And when I say "this world,"

390
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:03,770
that includes the King.

391
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,550
I was right.

392
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:14,680
It was far to the right.

393
00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:22,020
I thought you'd be glad to see me.

394
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,810
You came empty-handed?

395
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:36,320
There's a bed and a sofa in here.
Why are you sitting on the floor?

396
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:39,780
There's a draft in here,
especially on the left side of the bed.

397
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,800
Why are you here?

398
00:29:56,970 --> 00:29:58,930
I didn't want to leave you scared
all by yourself.

399
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:02,390
Trust me. I'm not a weird person here.

400
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:08,020
Why did you use the window
instead of the door if you're not weird?

401
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:11,190
You should know...

402
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:12,940
That's the shortcut.

403
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:15,070
The palace is really big.

404
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:18,280
I thought you couldn't sit on the floor.

405
00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:21,160
It's not so bad, actually.

406
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:24,950
And it feels kind of nice with the draft.

407
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:36,050
When are you going to show me my ID card?

408
00:30:40,050 --> 00:30:41,430
-Tomorrow.
-Why tomorrow?

409
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:43,720
Were you just pretending to have it?

410
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:45,220
I do have it.

411
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:48,310
You might try to go back to your world

412
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:51,150
if I show you.

413
00:30:58,570 --> 00:30:59,570
What is it?

414
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:01,990
What?

415
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:12,500
The doll on my car key.

416
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:14,800
It seems pretty cheap.

417
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:26,720
SHOOTING, ARCHERY

418
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:28,770
You can win this
if you hit the target seven times.

419
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:31,230
But if you've served in the military,

420
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:33,230
it'll be a piece of cake.

421
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,190
It's 10,000 won for 10 bullets.
How many do you want?

422
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,570
I only need seven bullets.

423
00:31:57,210 --> 00:31:58,800
You should really know,

424
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:02,090
nothing I have is cheap.

425
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,850
How much did you spend?

426
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:10,770
Anyone who's served in the military
can do it with their eyes closed.

427
00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:11,770
I knew it.

428
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:15,020
Everyone in your country is a swindler.

429
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:19,150
Be quiet. There's someone
guarding the door outside.

430
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:22,610
Are you stupid?
There are dozens of security cameras here.

431
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:29,330
Is that a security camera?

432
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,210
Wave to them.

433
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,710
Twelve people are watching us right now.

434
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,170
For real?

435
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:41,920
You believe everything I say now.

436
00:32:43,090 --> 00:32:44,050
That was a lie.

437
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:48,470
Are you kidding me?

438
00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:51,810
So

439
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,350
is that really a security camera or not?

440
00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:56,940
It isn't. I was just joking.

441
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,490
You want proof?

442
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:11,290
Move.

443
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:14,750
This might look romantic,

444
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:17,380
but it's actually really uncomfortable.

445
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:20,590
No, it's not uncomfortable at all.

446
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:30,140
I'm going to ask you something,
so just answer with yes or no.

447
00:33:31,770 --> 00:33:32,600
Okay.

448
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:35,230
You've never dated before, right?

449
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:38,440
You startled me.

450
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,230
Yes,

451
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:42,650
I have.

452
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:44,780
Should I guess when?

453
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,700
Guess.

454
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:47,620
Now.

455
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:55,750
Should I have done this?

456
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:21,730
Try guessing what I just proved.

457
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:24,190
The fact that I've dated before?

458
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:25,650
Or

459
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:28,570
that I'm dating right now?

460
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:55,850
Did Squad Two find the weapon used
in their murder case?

461
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:58,560
Chief Choe is begging me to help him out.

462
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:02,360
I just handed the information over.
It's a common kitchen knife.

463
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:04,110
Right.

464
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:06,320
It'd be about this size.

465
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,280
I see.

466
00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:13,950
Here, here, and here.

467
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,500
And made sure the victim would die.

468
00:35:20,210 --> 00:35:21,880
Why is the world so dark?

469
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,790
Let's live a bright life.

470
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,420
As bright as a light bulb.

471
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:30,930
I can't possibly be bright when
my husband is leaving home at this hour.

472
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,140
Come on, I don't want to leave.

473
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:37,220
But I can't help it.
Sin-jae asked for just one glass...

474
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:40,140
Don't make me work
after work hours have passed.

475
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:44,020
I can check your call records
within ten minutes.

476
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:48,610
Honey, wait. I'll push that.

477
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:49,530
No, I'll do it.

478
00:35:49,610 --> 00:35:51,360
Honey, then could I put that in the car

479
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:53,240
and just take a taxi
in front of the building?

480
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,780
VIOLENT CRIMES DIVISION SQUAD 3

481
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:13,640
CHIEF PARK

482
00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:17,890
I'm having a drink with you today.

483
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:22,310
Who are you actually meeting, then?

484
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,440
Loneliness.

485
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:37,790
I'M BORED, LET'S PLAY POOL

486
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:53,130
I told you to sleep well,
but I guess you didn't.

487
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:56,300
It's a Royal Guard uniform.

488
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,140
You want me to run away in disguise?

489
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:02,640
I won't let you do that.

490
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:05,650
I have a full schedule today.

491
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:07,980
Get dressed and come out.

492
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:09,610
We have to leave
without Head Court Lady Noh noticing.

493
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:15,030
If that was your plan,
you should've been more meticulous.

494
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:27,750
My goodness, gracious.

495
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:31,050
I made sure to separate you,
but you came here this early.

496
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:34,550
Right, I guess it's better for you
to go outside.

497
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:37,590
Come back as late as you can.

498
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,890
And don't get any photos taken.
No photos together!

499
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:44,180
My goodness.

500
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:51,940
This was my plan all along.

501
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:54,150
I've succeeded.

502
00:37:57,070 --> 00:37:58,700
You said you weren't a weird person here.

503
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:14,300
IT'S MY VERY FIRST TIME
SEEING HIS MAJESTY IN PERSON!

504
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:31,980
His Majesty will

505
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:35,110
make the first throw
for our victory today.

506
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,070
Please give a round of applause.

507
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:51,210
Please give a round of applause

508
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:55,130
and a loud cheer for the King
who did the first throw for us.

509
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,140
The architect Richard Fuller said,

510
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:05,890
"When I find a solution to a problem,

511
00:39:07,350 --> 00:39:10,900
I know that I am wrong if the solution
is not beautiful."

512
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,070
So I'm giving you this advice

513
00:39:15,110 --> 00:39:19,150
as an amateur mathematician
and also as your King.

514
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:22,530
WALK

515
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:24,540
Leave your lab
for at least 30 minutes a day.

516
00:39:26,790 --> 00:39:27,960
Your labs

517
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,210
need to be cleaned.

518
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:38,420
Get plenty of rest.

519
00:39:38,970 --> 00:39:42,010
Your bodies are not infinite decimals.

520
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:44,810
ATMOSPHERE

521
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:49,560
Share beautiful moments
with your lovers or family.

522
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:53,060
Even mathematicians can do it.

523
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:07,240
You are all proud mathematicians
of the Kingdom of Corea.

524
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:09,660
Whatever problem you are working on,

525
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:13,210
I hope your solution and your answer

526
00:40:14,790 --> 00:40:16,090
are both beautiful.

527
00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:35,520
Wasn't I cool?

528
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,360
Yes, you were.

529
00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:41,990
I think so, too.

530
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:44,070
I've thought that for a long time.

531
00:40:57,210 --> 00:40:58,090
Captain Jo.

532
00:40:58,170 --> 00:40:59,760
Please do as I requested.

533
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:07,100
Can you look this way, please?

534
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:16,860
It doesn't seem to be a present.

535
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:19,270
"I got you out of the palace
since you might stay locked up

536
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,820
in the study.

537
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:22,740
Have fun. I'll see you in the evening."

538
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:26,950
That is what His Majesty said.

539
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:30,790
His Majesty has other duties to attend to,
so you're on your own now.

540
00:41:38,090 --> 00:41:39,000
"Oh, thanks.

541
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,260
It's totally my style."

542
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:44,220
Tell him I said that.

543
00:41:47,050 --> 00:41:47,930
But...

544
00:41:49,390 --> 00:41:50,350
Do you have some money?

545
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:54,940
I bought your boss
chicken and stuff in the other world.

546
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:09,740
It takes about 50 minutes
to the disaster area.

547
00:42:09,830 --> 00:42:12,540
The relief supplies
have been delivered by train.

00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:09,760
It's fine, just go.

556
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:11,850
You should accept my help.

557
00:43:12,550 --> 00:43:14,220
Did you receive the photos?

558
00:43:22,770 --> 00:43:24,480
What are these? Did you send these?

559
00:43:25,690 --> 00:43:26,860
Did you photoshop me?

560
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:29,030
You're crazy.

561
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:32,450
This must be a new scamming method,
but you've chosen the wrong person.

562
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:38,040
I don't even have money
to buy pills to kill myself.

563
00:43:38,830 --> 00:43:42,380
Born on July 12th, 1989.

How do you know my birthdate?

565
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:50,630
The granddaughter of the founder
of a large pharmaceutical company.

Marries the first son of a rich family

567

after meeting him
at a yacht club in America.

568
00:43:57,180 --> 00:44:00,190
And the first baby
is born after four months.

569
00:44:01,310 --> 00:44:04,230
This is your life.

570
00:44:05,770 --> 00:44:07,780
If you want it to be.

571
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:14,830
I've never chosen the wrong person.

572
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:19,660
The woman in these photos is you.

573
00:44:21,290 --> 00:44:22,120
To be exact,

574
00:44:23,210 --> 00:44:24,710
it's you in another world.

575
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:27,840
In this world,

576
00:44:31,220 --> 00:44:33,390
you're living in hell.

577
00:44:52,820 --> 00:44:54,280
How did you get these photos?

578
00:44:55,070 --> 00:44:57,530
Did you come into my house?

579
00:44:57,620 --> 00:44:59,580
You have a useless lock,

580
00:45:00,790 --> 00:45:03,000
a window with no sunlight coming through,

581
00:45:03,670 --> 00:45:05,960
and walls that can't protect you
from the cold nor the heat.

582
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:08,090
Is that house any different

583
00:45:08,710 --> 00:45:09,800
from a grave?

584
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:12,970
How about giving your daughter

585
00:45:13,970 --> 00:45:16,010
a house, a car,

586
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:19,220
and parents like this?

587
00:45:20,970 --> 00:45:24,770
Instead of used garbage like that.

588
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:29,940
How do you know it's a girl?

589
00:45:33,490 --> 00:45:34,610
You...

590
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:38,200
Whether you're a swindler or a member
of a cult, you've got the wrong person.

591
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:39,530
I'm sending you to jail.

592
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:43,540
112 crime report. How may I help you?

593
00:45:48,130 --> 00:45:49,500
Hello? You may speak.

594
00:45:57,050 --> 00:45:58,430
Who are you?

595
00:45:59,010 --> 00:46:01,220
Someone who's going to save your life.

596
00:46:01,810 --> 00:46:03,100
How are you going to do that?

597
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:07,190
What do I have to do

598
00:46:11,270 --> 00:46:12,530
to get that?

599
00:46:13,740 --> 00:46:16,070
You just have to kill the other you.

600
00:46:18,570 --> 00:46:19,950
All right, then...

601
00:46:23,620 --> 00:46:25,660
Would you like to change

602
00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:27,960
your miserable life?

603
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:31,960
What are you going to do

604
00:46:32,590 --> 00:46:33,550
if I say no?

605
00:46:34,130 --> 00:46:35,590
I already saw your face.

606
00:46:37,590 --> 00:46:38,720
Am I going to die

607
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:40,600
instead of

608
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:42,140
her?

609
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:44,810
Well, I haven't thought about that yet.

610
00:46:46,230 --> 00:46:50,310
Nobody has refused until now.

611
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:58,200
It's okay

612
00:46:58,990 --> 00:47:01,240
for you to be the first exception.

613
00:47:03,030 --> 00:47:04,490
It'll be interesting to me.

614
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:08,500
Wait.

615
00:47:08,830 --> 00:47:11,040
Wait...

616
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:15,420
How

617
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:21,220
should I contact you?

618
00:47:29,690 --> 00:47:30,850
I'll be the one

619
00:47:31,650 --> 00:47:33,020
to contact you.

620
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:37,650
It's an urgent report from
the Ministry of National Defense.

621
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:39,990
A Chinese fishing boat
sent a distress signal

622
00:47:40,070 --> 00:47:41,950
in the intermediate zone of the East Sea.

623
00:47:42,030 --> 00:47:44,910
The Yi Sun-sin Destroyer
that was nearby received the signal.

624
00:47:45,950 --> 00:47:47,160
Are they sure it's a fishing boat?

625
00:47:47,250 --> 00:47:48,500
Yes, they confirmed it.

626
00:47:48,580 --> 00:47:52,000
They say it must've been stranded
because of the severe fog and swells.

627
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:53,880
This happened last spring as well.

628
00:47:54,380 --> 00:47:56,960
The Japanese Navy
could interfere again, right?

629
00:47:57,130 --> 00:48:00,090
Yes, after Japan broke off
the EEZ agreement,

630
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:02,430
both Japan and China
are sensitive about such things.

631
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:04,140
Let's just think simply.

632
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:06,600
We'll be more aggressive
at the next negotiation with Japan,

633
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:08,640
and rescue those people
since we got the signal.

634
00:48:09,230 --> 00:48:12,650
And tell our people to ask them
why they keep fishing in our waters.

635
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:15,360
Yes, ma'am.

636

CERTIFICATE OF APPOINTMENT
KOO SEO-RYEONG

637
00:48:30,620 --> 00:48:32,210
The King of the Kingdom of Corea

638
00:48:32,750 --> 00:48:34,170
accepts the people's decision

639
00:48:34,790 --> 00:48:37,550
and allows Prime Minister Koo
to form the Cabinet.

640
00:48:42,930 --> 00:48:44,970
I hope you become a Prime Minister
who values the citizens.

641
00:48:47,010 --> 00:48:48,720
I will do my best, Your Majesty.

642
00:48:51,140 --> 00:48:53,730
What kind of Prime Minister
should I be to you?

643
00:48:56,610 --> 00:48:59,780
Please be a Prime Minister
who mostly gives written reports.

644
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:10,750
Prime Minister Koo.

645
00:49:10,830 --> 00:49:12,750
I can never be indebted to you.

646
00:49:13,370 --> 00:49:15,960
Let's wait and see how my absence
will be historically recorded

647
00:49:17,130 --> 00:49:18,500
in the pages of history books.

My gosh, no way.

650
00:50:23,780 --> 00:50:24,650
Oh, I'm sorry.

651
00:50:24,740 --> 00:50:25,570
It's fine.

652
00:50:30,740 --> 00:50:33,040
KINGDOM OF COREA MAINTAINS
4TH HIGHEST GDP IN THE WORLD

653
00:50:33,620 --> 00:50:34,450
Fourth?

654
00:50:36,710 --> 00:50:37,790
The Republic...

655
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,460
I mean, the Kingdom of Corea's
GDP is that high?

656
00:50:41,540 --> 00:50:44,300
We export rare-earth elements
internationally.

657
00:50:45,010 --> 00:50:46,170
It's even in school textbooks.

658
00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:50,140
I'm sorry, but what are
rare-earth elements?

659
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:52,390
It's always mentioned in exams.

660
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:54,560
Cerium, lanthanum, yttrium, samarium...

661
00:50:57,350 --> 00:50:58,480
Are you a foreigner?

662
00:51:01,190 --> 00:51:03,020
Yeah, something like that.

663
00:51:04,190 --> 00:51:06,280
So, what are they?

664
00:51:06,530 --> 00:51:08,150
Well, they're minerals.

665
00:51:08,780 --> 00:51:12,330
There are 30 million tons
just in the northern area, and in the sea.

666
00:51:12,410 --> 00:51:16,080
Anyway, those minerals in the northern
area are worth 20 billion dollars a ton,

667
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:18,410
so it'd be about six quintillion dollars.

668
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:22,340
And that's all owned
by the Kingdom of Corea?

669
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:23,670
Oh, no.

670
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:26,880
The mountains where they're buried
are owned by the royal court,

671
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:29,550
so they're actually the King's.

672
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:37,180
It's a diamond?

673
00:51:37,930 --> 00:51:40,690
If that's a diamond, I'm Princess Diana.

674
00:51:41,730 --> 00:51:42,610
A king?

675
00:51:43,110 --> 00:51:46,030
You're a total nutjob.
This is so ridiculous.

676
00:51:49,570 --> 00:51:51,410
ROYAL COURT OF KINGDOM OF COREA

677
00:51:52,740 --> 00:51:54,660
You're really one
or the other, aren't you?

678
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:10,590
CTX MOUNT KUMGANG NATIONAL PARK

CTX TRAINS
TO MOKPO TO MOUNT PAEKTU

681
00:52:23,980 --> 00:52:25,320
The CTX train

682
00:52:26,020 --> 00:52:30,110
bound for Pyongyang is ready to depart
on platform number three.

683
00:52:30,860 --> 00:52:31,700
BUSAN STATION TO SEOUL STATION

684
00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:34,700
Passengers, please check the ticket

685
00:52:34,780 --> 00:52:36,950
and board the train immediately.

686
00:52:37,950 --> 00:52:39,580
Sir. Over there.

687
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:47,500
Hey, look who it is. Isn't that Luna?

688
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:49,710
She even changed her hairstyle.

689
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:51,380
-Hey.
-Yes, sir.

690
00:52:51,470 --> 00:52:52,630
-Get her.
-Yes, sir.

691
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:58,100
Who are you to block my way?
Do you have a death wish?

692
00:52:58,260 --> 00:52:59,640
You're...

693
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:00,850
Yes, I'm Jo Yeong.

694
00:53:02,230 --> 00:53:03,230
You got out quickly.

695
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:06,860
-What did you say that woman's name was?
-Luna.

696
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:09,110
You know, the one
we were chasing last time.

697
00:53:09,190 --> 00:53:10,190
Are you sure?

698
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:11,690
She took off with our boss' money

699
00:53:11,780 --> 00:53:14,160
and even got a new hairstyle with it.
How could we forget her?

700
00:53:14,530 --> 00:53:16,820
Our boss is still in jail because of her.

701
00:53:16,910 --> 00:53:19,160
-But that bitch is wandering around--
-All right. Get lost.

702
00:53:19,740 --> 00:53:20,950
She's my guest for now.

703
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:22,500
Don't make me repeat myself.

704
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:55,820
Prime Minister, you're so pretty!

705
00:53:55,910 --> 00:53:57,160
You're so pretty!

706
00:53:57,410 --> 00:53:59,120
Prime Minister, you're so pretty!

707
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:02,830
RELATIVE SEARCH RESULTS TO LEE GON,
LEE GON AND KOO SEO-RYEONG MARRIAGE

708
00:54:02,910 --> 00:54:04,660
Prime Minister, make sure to eat well.

709
00:54:04,750 --> 00:54:06,250
-Love you all!
-Me too, Prime Minister!

710
00:54:06,330 --> 00:54:07,500
Stay healthy!

711
00:54:14,170 --> 00:54:16,260
You're six months pregnant,
but you still look slim.

712
00:54:16,430 --> 00:54:18,470
I watch my figure even more than
before I got married.

713
00:54:18,590 --> 00:54:20,180
My husband didn't want me to gain weight.

714
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:22,100
Right, don't end up like me.

715
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:24,180
My husband cheated on me

716
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:26,140
when I was seven months pregnant.

717
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:30,480
Excuse me.

718
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:32,360
I guess Seo-ryeong is coming.

719
00:54:32,650 --> 00:54:35,280
I've just lost my appetite.
Did she have to come?

720
00:54:35,860 --> 00:54:36,900
I'm leaving first.

721
00:54:36,990 --> 00:54:38,530
-You're leaving?
-Yeah.

722
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:47,920
Did she just leave?

723
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,670
She said she lost her appetite.

724
00:54:50,290 --> 00:54:52,840
The food isn't even served yet.
That's nonsense.

725
00:54:53,090 --> 00:54:54,210
Didn't you know?

726
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:56,380
Congressman Park Cheol-ung,
the one involved in the sex scandal.

727
00:54:56,470 --> 00:54:57,760
He's her sister-in-law's brother-in-law.

728
00:54:57,840 --> 00:54:59,090
So what?

729
00:54:59,180 --> 00:55:00,800
I barely remember my sister-in-law's face.

730
00:55:00,890 --> 00:55:03,850
Bad things keep happening
to people who oppose you.

731
00:55:04,970 --> 00:55:08,600
Rumors say the only one
who benefits from the scandal is you.

732
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:10,860
The person who benefits the most

733
00:55:11,270 --> 00:55:12,230
is usually the culprit.

734
00:55:12,820 --> 00:55:15,740
It's just that the people who oppose me
happen to have dark secrets.

735
00:55:16,530 --> 00:55:19,780
My husband says Prince Buyeong
has your back.

736
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:22,080
-Is that true?
-What if it is?

737
00:55:22,530 --> 00:55:24,160
Does he want to take sides with me?

738
00:55:24,790 --> 00:55:25,830
Can he?

739
00:55:26,910 --> 00:55:28,710
Are the Royal Family your in-laws now?

740
00:55:29,290 --> 00:55:30,830
Is that why you're serving another term?

741
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:32,250
You really think she can?

742
00:55:32,670 --> 00:55:35,880
That "I studied while selling fish"
doesn't work anymore.

743
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:39,430
A queen with no term limit is better

744
00:55:39,550 --> 00:55:41,760
than a Prime Minister
with a five-year term.

745
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:44,760
But I'm not sure
if His Majesty likes old women.

746
00:55:46,890 --> 00:55:49,560
Do you want to see
if it still works or not?

747
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:53,150
What will you do if the priority
for the remainder of my term

748
00:55:53,230 --> 00:55:55,980
is to do a tax investigation into
your husband's company, Sungwoon Group?

749
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:59,990
What'll you do
if I obsess over that like a lunatic?

750
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:04,530
Aren't you going to leave?

751
00:56:05,740 --> 00:56:09,330
I don't think our conversation
will be good for your baby.

752
00:56:13,250 --> 00:56:14,250
Auntie's sorry about that.

753
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:43,740
SEOUL JONGNO POLICE STATION

754
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:00,760
Excuse me.

755
00:57:03,930 --> 00:57:06,430
Don't you know me?

756
00:57:07,430 --> 00:57:08,350
It's Jeong Tae-eul.

757
00:57:09,020 --> 00:57:09,930
Don't you know?

758
00:57:10,020 --> 00:57:11,020
Well...

759
00:57:11,310 --> 00:57:12,350
Do you know her?

760
00:57:16,610 --> 00:57:18,360
No, I don't. Who are you?

761
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:20,940
Then what about Kang Sin-jae? Or Jangmi?

762
00:57:21,190 --> 00:57:23,610
Or what about Director Kim Hee-ju
from Forensics?

763
00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:25,450
I'm not sure who they are.

764
00:57:25,530 --> 00:57:28,160
The names sound like
they are kind-hearted people...

765
00:57:28,740 --> 00:57:29,700
What is this about?

766
00:57:30,370 --> 00:57:31,500
Are you visiting the station?

767
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:34,830
Are you a detective?

768
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:40,510
No, it's nothing. I guess I was mistaken.

769
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:43,420
Enjoy your meal.

770
00:57:44,510 --> 00:57:45,590
-All right.
-Oh, okay.

771
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:52,480
You've been on the news
too often these days.

772
00:57:52,770 --> 00:57:55,690
Yeah, I was so shocked.
I look so good on screen.

773
00:57:55,770 --> 00:57:56,600
You looked so cool.

774
00:57:56,690 --> 00:57:58,400
What do you want to eat?
I want ox bone soup.

775
00:57:58,480 --> 00:57:59,770
I want ox knee soup.

776
00:58:00,780 --> 00:58:04,950
Hey, but how did she know
we were on our way to eat?

777
00:58:12,250 --> 00:58:13,200
Bye.

778
00:58:18,250 --> 00:58:20,630
-Let's eat ox knee soup.
-All right. There's a place I know.

779
00:58:20,710 --> 00:58:24,420
It's been there for 50 years, and
the bone soup tastes just like knee soup.

780
00:58:24,510 --> 00:58:25,720
Don't be ridiculous.

781
00:58:44,860 --> 00:58:46,650
If he hasn't become a detective...

782
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:49,030
Right...

783
00:58:49,780 --> 00:58:51,450
It means his family didn't get bankrupt.

784
00:58:52,790 --> 00:58:55,250
The Kang Sin-jae of the Kingdom of Corea

785
00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:57,080
is so cool.

786
00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:01,840
Wow.

787
01:00:19,370 --> 01:00:20,250
Oh, hey.

788
01:00:21,250 --> 01:00:22,580
I'm running into you often lately.

789
01:00:23,790 --> 01:00:25,000
And you're still eating sweets.

790
01:00:25,590 --> 01:00:28,550
I don't eat sweets that often,
but I keep getting caught eating them.

791
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:32,390
-What are you doing in this neighborhood?
-I live around here.

792
01:00:34,550 --> 01:00:36,640
Well, I used to live around here.

793
01:00:38,350 --> 01:00:39,730
I guess you're having a gathering today.

794
01:00:41,730 --> 01:00:43,100
I'm just going to have some drinks.

795
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:45,480
This won't be enough
if I start drinking in the daytime.

796
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:47,270
Do you want one?

797
01:00:56,780 --> 01:00:59,200
Is it okay for a psychiatrist
to be an alcoholic?

798
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:03,290
I'm not that dependent.
I have a high alcohol tolerance.

799
01:01:04,830 --> 01:01:06,590
But are sweets really effective?

800
01:01:09,050 --> 01:01:11,130
It's just nice
because it's sweet and melts fast.

801
01:01:11,220 --> 01:01:13,680
Isn't it better for it to melt
slowly if it's sweet?

802
01:01:13,930 --> 01:01:15,050
It's going to melt anyway.

803
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:20,180
By the way, what's your job?

804
01:01:21,430 --> 01:01:24,690
I thought I'd ask you at the next session,
but you didn't come.

805
01:01:26,770 --> 01:01:28,770
-I'm a detective.
-Really?

806
01:01:29,610 --> 01:01:31,360
I guessed totally wrong.

807
01:01:32,490 --> 01:01:35,070
-I thought you were a gangster.
-What kind of psychiatrist...

808
01:01:36,820 --> 01:01:38,160
That's why the meds didn't work.

809
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:40,080
You probably didn't even take them.

810
01:01:42,250 --> 01:01:44,170
When did you move away
from this neighborhood?

811
01:01:44,580 --> 01:01:47,420
I've always lived here,
so we could've run into each other...

812
01:01:51,420 --> 01:01:55,180
Yes. I told you that my family
got bankrupt when I was little.

813
01:01:56,840 --> 01:01:58,430
We moved out when I was in middle school.

814
01:02:00,810 --> 01:02:02,430
The house prices here
went up a lot, right?

815
01:02:02,980 --> 01:02:05,850
I visit here sometimes,
but I feel so bitter.

816
01:02:07,900 --> 01:02:10,860
What do you think makes you
keep returning to this place?

817
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:15,150
Do you still have
the same recurring nightmares?

818
01:02:18,660 --> 01:02:20,330
Don't start a session
so suddenly like this.

819
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:22,910
Especially when you're drinking.

820
01:02:23,330 --> 01:02:24,960
You're treating me like some quack.

821
01:02:27,630 --> 01:02:29,130
All right, let's just drink then.

822
01:02:44,850 --> 01:02:47,810
I'M BORED, LET'S PLAY POOL

823
01:02:50,190 --> 01:02:51,230
Jeong who?

824
01:02:51,730 --> 01:02:52,690
SUIM ORIENTAL CLINIC

825
01:02:52,780 --> 01:02:54,360
Jeong Do-in.

826
01:02:54,860 --> 01:02:58,160
He's a Taekwondo instructor
at a Taekwondo center.

827
01:02:58,780 --> 01:03:00,240
I don't know anyone by that name.

828
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:04,450
Then...

829
01:03:07,790 --> 01:03:12,000
How about a woman named Ahn Bong-hui?

830
01:03:13,130 --> 01:03:14,090
Do you know her?

831
01:03:14,170 --> 01:03:16,170
Her face looks really similar to mine.

832
01:03:16,380 --> 01:03:18,720
Have you ever seen her?

833
01:03:19,590 --> 01:03:20,800
Ahn Bong-hui?

834
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:22,810
No, I haven't.

835
01:03:23,390 --> 01:03:25,350
We've lived here for 30 years.

836
01:03:25,980 --> 01:03:28,100
Why? Did they say they live here?

837
01:03:29,350 --> 01:03:31,110
No, never mind. Thank you.

838
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:45,410
It's 41,800 won.

839
01:03:45,540 --> 01:03:46,580
Oh, right. One second.

840
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:59,170
I'm sorry, but how much
is a standing ticket?

841
01:04:00,300 --> 01:04:01,680
It's 34,800 won.

842
01:04:06,180 --> 01:04:09,140
I rode a taxi
without thinking about the ticket.

843
01:04:10,140 --> 01:04:13,730
I'm sorry,
but is there a bus terminal in Gangnam?

844
01:04:14,360 --> 01:04:15,360
There's one in Songpa-gu.

845
01:04:16,110 --> 01:04:19,030
But even if you go now,
you'd miss the last bus.

846
01:04:19,530 --> 01:04:20,780
Don't you have a card?

847
01:04:26,450 --> 01:04:29,540
I'm telling you, it's not a prank call!

848
01:04:29,620 --> 01:04:31,040
I really know Lee Gon...

849
01:04:33,580 --> 01:04:35,880
I mean, the King... I know the King.

850
01:04:36,380 --> 01:04:38,420
Okay? I'm an acquaintance.

851
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:39,630
I...

852
01:04:44,350 --> 01:04:45,890
I'm really serious.

853
01:04:47,010 --> 01:04:49,060
I just need to talk to him for one minute.

854
01:04:52,770 --> 01:04:56,150
I'm short of 2,600 won,

855
01:04:56,980 --> 01:04:59,610
so I can't return to Busan right now.

856
01:05:04,950 --> 01:05:05,910
Just ten seconds.

857
01:05:05,990 --> 01:05:08,540
Please, just ten seconds. I...

858
01:05:16,090 --> 01:05:16,960
Who

859
01:05:18,550 --> 01:05:20,260
did you say it was just now?

860
01:05:21,550 --> 01:05:22,510
Well, Your Majesty,

861
01:05:23,130 --> 01:05:25,640
some woman called
the Royal Court's main number

862
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:27,720
seventeen times, asking for you.

863
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:30,520
-The security team was checking--
-No,

864
01:05:31,730 --> 01:05:33,390
I mean the name of the caller.

865
01:05:34,730 --> 01:05:36,980
Well, she said she was Princess Diana.

866
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:40,030
They tracked her location just in case,
and she's at Seoul Station.

867
01:05:42,570 --> 01:05:43,490
Turn the helicopter.

868
01:05:44,410 --> 01:05:45,530
We're going to Seoul.

869
01:05:46,450 --> 01:05:47,530
Pardon?

870
01:05:47,620 --> 01:05:50,410
Check Captain Jo's location right now.

871
01:05:50,490 --> 01:05:51,410
Yes, Your Majesty.

872
01:06:13,730 --> 01:06:14,640
Oh, my gosh.

873
01:06:17,350 --> 01:06:18,360
What are you doing here?

874
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:19,980
I received orders from the King.

875
01:06:20,980 --> 01:06:23,030
He said you must be kept alive
until your beheading.

876
01:06:27,160 --> 01:06:29,700
But do you even really behead people here?

877
01:06:30,330 --> 01:06:33,290
It hasn't happened since 1920, but...

878
01:06:35,250 --> 01:06:37,040
it seems like it could happen again soon.

879
01:06:37,120 --> 01:06:38,380
My gosh.

880
01:06:40,670 --> 01:06:41,920
Who are you, really?

881
01:06:42,460 --> 01:06:43,630
Are you really a detective?

882
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:46,630
Why did you go
to the police station earlier?

883
01:06:48,890 --> 01:06:50,100
Were you following me?

884
01:06:51,850 --> 01:06:52,680
Follow me.

885
01:07:43,900 --> 01:07:44,900
I heard you were looking for me.

886
01:07:46,110 --> 01:07:46,990
Yes.

887
01:07:47,070 --> 01:07:48,200
Seventeen times.

888
01:07:49,110 --> 01:07:50,030
Yes.

889
01:07:50,110 --> 01:07:51,950
I thought you were going to stay in Busan.

890
01:07:52,490 --> 01:07:53,950
Why did you come so far?

891
01:07:55,870 --> 01:07:57,580
Did you get to find Ahn Bong-hui?

892
01:07:57,870 --> 01:07:58,870
How did you know?

893
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,130
Since when were you following me?

894
01:08:04,290 --> 01:08:06,510
You should have lent me money
if you were there all along.

895
01:08:08,130 --> 01:08:09,050
Who is she?

896
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:12,300
Who are you looking for in this world?

897
01:08:16,890 --> 01:08:18,020
My mom.

898
01:08:20,140 --> 01:08:21,690
If this is a parallel world...

899
01:08:22,440 --> 01:08:25,400
And since Na-ri and Eun-sup are both here,

900
01:08:27,030 --> 01:08:29,110
although I might not exist...

901
01:08:31,360 --> 01:08:32,950
my mother could still be alive.

902
01:08:34,580 --> 01:08:36,160
I know she is someone else,

903
01:08:37,870 --> 01:08:39,710
but I didn't want her to be sick
in this world.

904
01:08:40,790 --> 01:08:44,000
I only have memories of her
from when I was five.

905
01:08:46,420 --> 01:08:48,130
So I just wanted to watch her from afar.

906
01:08:48,840 --> 01:08:50,220
That's why I came here.

907
01:08:52,430 --> 01:08:53,840
You should have told me.

908
01:08:54,760 --> 01:08:55,970
I was just curious.

909
01:08:57,010 --> 01:08:58,140
But she wasn't there.

910
01:08:59,770 --> 01:09:00,640
Anyway...

911
01:09:00,890 --> 01:09:03,980
I had fun today because of you.

912
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:05,980
Is that why you searched for KTX?

913
01:09:06,610 --> 01:09:08,070
I was wondering what KTX is.

914
01:09:09,440 --> 01:09:10,860
Search?

915
01:09:13,360 --> 01:09:14,490
He didn't tell me that.

916
01:09:15,160 --> 01:09:16,830
The auto-save function told me.

917
01:09:17,870 --> 01:09:19,870
You were curious about a lot of things.

918
01:09:20,620 --> 01:09:22,660
Why were you curious about
Lee Gon's ex-girlfriend?

919
01:09:23,330 --> 01:09:24,750
Didn't you think
that I never had a girlfriend?

920
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:29,340
Why would you read that?

921
01:09:30,050 --> 01:09:30,920
That's cheating.

922
01:09:33,090 --> 01:09:34,760
Your Majesty, Prime Minister Koo is--

923
01:09:34,840 --> 01:09:37,390
Right. You looked up
Prime Minister Koo as well.

924
01:09:37,470 --> 01:09:39,010
That was because...

925
01:09:39,720 --> 01:09:43,520
Because I heard she was
the youngest female Prime Minister.

926
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:46,060
I only looked up her name
because I was amazed by that.

927
01:09:47,560 --> 01:09:48,980
Why? Do you feel guilty?

928
01:09:49,070 --> 01:09:50,570
I meet her every Friday.

929
01:09:52,150 --> 01:09:53,070
Is she IU?

930
01:10:00,660 --> 01:10:02,040
Yes, it's Prime Minister Koo.

931
01:10:02,660 --> 01:10:06,080
She probably got a report
that your helicopter landed in Seoul.

932
01:10:36,110 --> 01:10:38,660
I'm seeing you at an unexpected hour,
in an unexpected place,

933
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:41,660
with an unexpected person, Your Majesty.

934
01:10:42,490 --> 01:10:43,370
You're right.

935
01:10:43,870 --> 01:10:45,870
And you've put me in an awkward situation.

936
01:10:48,040 --> 01:10:48,880
Nice to meet you.

937
01:10:50,170 --> 01:10:52,340
I'm Koo Seo-ryeong,
Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Corea.

938
01:11:50,850 --> 01:11:52,650
