1
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:15,930
JEONG TAE-EUL

2
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:17,810
I'm bored, let's play pool.

3
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:24,730
EPISODE 5

4
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:28,740
Thank you for your kindness.

5
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,030
I should repay you in cash,

6
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:33,910
but our worlds had different bills,
so I got you goods instead.

7
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:39,660
I hope you can get a satisfactory price.

8
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,540
Where did you get this?

9
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:48,630
Did you find oil in your yard
or something?

10
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,810
Oh, Sin-jae.

11
00:00:57,890 --> 00:00:59,560
Can I get a sweet milk tea?

12
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,850
I guess Squad Three is off duty tomorrow.

13
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:04,770
Yes, I was thinking of playing pool.

14
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:07,860
I don't see the horse that was here.

15
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:10,190
Maximus? It's been gone for a while.

16
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,530
Everyone's been asking,
so I even wrote it on the sign out front.

17
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:24,420
But Tae-eul isn't here.

18
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:26,790
Who are you playing pool with?

19
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:30,340
-She's not here?
-Maybe she's back.

20
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,590
She left with that King guy a while ago.

21
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:38,890
THE HORSE ISN'T HERE

22
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,020
I'M BORED, LET'S PLAY POOL

23
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:52,070
Head Court Lady Noh, it's me.

24
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:55,740
His Majesty just came back,
and he has a guest.

25
00:01:58,910 --> 00:01:59,990
It's a woman.

26
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:03,830
Tell His Majesty to take a detour,

27
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:05,920
and use the sea route.

28
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,250
He shouldn't be seen by people.

29
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:12,920
Don't worry about the palace,
I'll make sure nobody talks.

30
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:23,310
FOUR TIGER SWORD

31
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:36,360
I'm the King of the Kingdom of Corea.

32
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,160
And my name, which you cannot say,

33
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:45,710
is Lee Gon.

34
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,800
So

35
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:57,590
you do have a name.

36
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:03,810
If you really have a name,

37
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:08,020
I guess there's no way
to avoid a beheading now.

38
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:14,780
From the way you talked to me so far,
it's only right to behead you right away.

39
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:23,200
-I'll escort you to the palace.
-Let me take care of Maximus first.

40
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:26,120
The trip had been too long for her age.

41
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,410
Come to the racetracks.

42
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,710
Withdraw the guards from the racetracks
right now.

43
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:38,170
Two of you go to the control room
and get the security footage.

44
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,180
The rest, follow me.

45
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:07,330
What is this place?

46
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,790
Is it some kind of a fourth dimension?

47
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:13,250
I'm not sure yet.

48
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,170
I guess we can say it's something between
1 and 0 in my world and yours.

49
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:21,220
This is a place that cannot be
explained scientifically.

50
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:27,310
Do you see that balloon?

51
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:31,100
Balloons usually pop within ten hours.

52
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:34,480
But that one has been floating
like that for over ten days.

53
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,610
It hasn't popped or floated away.

54
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:40,320
It's exactly where I let it go.

55
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:44,820
That means there's no light,
wind or air here.

56
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:46,740
Isn't that amazing?

57
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:48,700
If it's not science, what is it?

58
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:52,370
Is it some kind of magic?

59
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:55,460
It could be a part of a legend.

60
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:59,090
Time flows differently here as well.

61
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:01,840
One minute here is about an hour outside.

62
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:04,090
My watch stops here,

63
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:05,850
so I went back and forth
for several days to check.

64
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:10,730
How could you check when clocks stop here?

65
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,730
I used Euler's number.

66
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:17,730
I don't know how deep

67
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,240
or how vast this place is.

68
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,780
I'll reach the edge of this place someday.

69
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,450
And I'll tell you

70
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,370
all about it.

71
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,580
But for today, let's go to my world.

72
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:48,010
Lady Maximus has a lower blood pressure
than last time,

73
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:51,600
but it's still within a normal range.

74
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,520
"Lady"?

75
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,440
A horse is called a lady...

76
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:00,480
I will do another thorough checkup
in the morning, Your Majesty.

77
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:02,240
Please do.

78
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,710
I told you so. Everything I said to you
was true, wasn't it?

79
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,880
Don't you see that's driving me crazy?

80
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:22,920
If this is all real, it's terrifying.

81
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:25,880
And if it's not, that means I'm crazy.

82
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:27,180
You should watch your manners.

83
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:28,890
And that face.

84
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:30,470
He is supposed to be on my side.

85
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:32,720
He's been on my side since I was three.

86
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:37,350
Is that gun real?

87
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:39,400
Can I take a look at it?

88
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:46,740
She knows how to handle it. Let her be.

89
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:49,530
She has to see for herself to believe it.

90
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:50,780
Believe what?

91
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,200
That she just crossed between 1 and 0.

92
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:04,800
No way.

93
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:07,380
This is real?

94
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:09,510
This P30

95
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:12,050
is actually real?

96
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:16,770
I'm going to check something.

97
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:19,270
It's nothing personal.

98
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,910
I told you. She can handle guns.

99
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:35,580
I'm letting this go just this once
because you're His Majesty's guest.

100
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:38,460
So...

101
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,080
This country...

102
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:42,080
And you being the King.

103
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,460
It's all real?

104
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:46,050
It's all real.

105
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:50,550
That gun, this world, and me.

106
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,010
So don't think of confirming that
by pulling the trigger.

107
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:58,310
This guy isn't going to move an inch.

108
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:01,100
Loosen your grip

109
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,270
unless you want to get killed.

110
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:20,920
Your Majesty, is she...

111
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Yes.

112
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,500
She's Lieutenant Jeong Tae-eul.

113
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:28,210
Do you

114
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:29,970
know me as well?

115
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:54,990
Welcome to my palace.

116
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:11,090
This is Gwangyeongjeon.

117
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:12,680
It's my private residence.

118
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:15,180
Make yourself at home...

119
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,930
Did you really have to do this?

120
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,350
Are you trying to worry me to death?

121
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,320
Head Court Lady Noh...

122
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:30,230
I think it has only been
about 10 minutes and 50 seconds

123
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,450
since she believed I'm a king.

124
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,910
She's the important person who knows

125
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,040
where the buttons came from.

126
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,330
It's nice to meet you. I'm--

127
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:48,460
Put all your belongings here in the box.

128
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:54,720
Everyone has to go through
a security check when entering the palace.

129
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,510
Everyone including the court ladies
and even the Prime Minister.

130
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:05,690
You reap what you sow.

131
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:21,450
You're giving them back
to me later, right?

132
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:24,660
I'll be penalized
if I lose my ID card again.

133
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,630
You recognize her face, right?

134
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:32,460
You're right.

135
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:38,180
Do I have to get frisked now?

136
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:39,760
We'll skip that.

137
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:41,640
I should trust you.

138
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:44,060
You're my King's guest.

139
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,860
Let me talk to you for a moment.

140
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,320
Now?

141
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:57,570
I'm sure you want to talk later.

142
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,700
But I also would have liked it
if you had left the palace later

143
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:07,120
and brought a guest according
to the right procedures later.

144
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:11,880
There were five guards and one person
at the stable who saw her.

145
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:15,420
Twelve court ladies who would be
suspicious of being

146
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:17,090
-dismissed suddenly--
-I was on my way.

147
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,050
I needed to talk now anyway.

148
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,230
You should leave, too.

149
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:29,350
It's a King's order.

150
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:40,110
Don't worry.

151
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:42,070
Just wait here.

152
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,240
I'll ditch her somehow and come back.

153
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:47,790
My goodness...

154
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,290
You're really asking for it, aren't you?

155
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:55,880
I mean,

156
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:58,630
Your Highness.

157
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,720
I guess that was the wrong thing to say.

158
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:10,140
She really believes it now.

159
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,440
That I'm the King.

160
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:26,160
My goodness, my head.

161
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:27,950
Oh, my heart.

162
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,250
My goodness.

163
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:10,330
You have a meeting at 8 a.m.
regarding the 25th anniversary

164
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:12,120
of your coronation with the staff.

165
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:16,040
And you have an appointment for tea
at 10 a.m. with press company CEOs,

166
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:18,300
then you must make the first throw
at the basketball

167
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:19,710
season-opening ceremony at 1 p.m.

168
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,760
Hang on.

169
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:23,340
I left the palace for just half a day,

170
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:25,300
and I have that many things to do?

171
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:28,850
Maybe someone in the court
has a grudge on you.

172
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,230
-Is there more?
-Yes.

173
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:35,600
You have a speech to deliver at 2 p.m.

174
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:37,150
at the International Congress of
Mathematicians.

175
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:40,570
Then there is a flood relief supply
delivery ceremony at 4 p.m.

176
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:42,570
You can go there by helicopter.

177
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:43,740
All right.

178
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:45,410
I'll do all that,

179
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:47,280
so please let me eat dinner freely.

180
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:51,250
It's always suspicious
when you do something on your own.

181
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,960
You're crossing the line now.

182
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:55,540
I'll be eating by myself in the study.

183
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:57,670
Alone.

184
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:03,090
There is a guest in His Majesty's study.

185
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,970
You must keep that guest

186
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:09,010
locked up in there
until I give other orders.

187
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:28,280
Ironically, my first duty as a king

188
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:30,660
was to carry out
the funeral of the former king.

189
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:32,330
It was when I was eight.

190
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:48,390
I'm positive now

191
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:50,640
that it's a parallel universe.

192
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:53,640
Pardon?

193
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,100
Na-ri.

194
00:14:57,770 --> 00:14:58,650
Myeong Na-ri.

195
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:00,610
Who's Myeong Na-ri?

196
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:04,740
I'm Myeong Seung-a
from the Royal Public Affairs Office.

197
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:17,330
I know it won't be true,

198
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,630
but I just want to make sure.

199
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:21,960
Don't you own a building?

200
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:24,960
Didn't you rent it out
to a Taekwondo center?

201
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:31,220
I do own buildings,
but they're all in Canada.

202
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,350
Would you like some tea?

203
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:36,230
It's herb tea that will help you
have a good night's sleep.

204
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:42,900
You want me to fall asleep?

205
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:44,480
I'd be grateful if you could.

206
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:46,610
I came here to keep an eye on you,

207
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:50,200
and you won't be able to leave
until Head Court Lady Noh says otherwise.

208
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,410
It will be easy for both of us
if you sleep.

209
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,330
You're really straightforward,

210
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,160
just like Na-ri.

211
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:02,290
I...

212
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:06,260
Can I use that laptop over there?

213
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:09,300
Of course not. You can't use His Majesty's
laptop without his permission.

214
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:15,600
-It's the year 2019 here, right?
-Yes.

215
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,480
And was this room's owner born in 1987?

216
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:20,060
Of course.

217
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:22,690
And the cultural capital is Busan,

218
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:25,190
and there are 63 buildings
called 63 Building.

219
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:27,070
There's only one 63 Building
in Yeouido, Seoul.

220
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:27,990
That little jerk.

221
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:30,990
Did you just swear at me?

222
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:37,580
What would be the better answer?

223
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:44,840
Can I have alcohol instead of tea?

224
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:47,670
I'd love some soju.

225
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,970
Your Majesty, where did you go this time?

226
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,470
A parallel universe.

227
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:24,830
Why do you need a laptop?

228
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:29,130
I wanted to look some stuff up
on the internet.

229
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:35,840
It's a business phone,
so I can't lend it to you.

230
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:39,060
But if you tell me,
I'll read out the search results for you.

231
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:41,600
I guess that will work.

232
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,400
All right. Then...

233
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,270
Lee Gon.

234
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:52,190
What did you just say?

235
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,570
Lee Gon.

236
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,780
Isn't the King's name Lee Gon?

237
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:57,830
Have you lost your mind?

238
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:01,120
Are you just casually
calling the King's name like that?

239
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:06,170
You don't even know the 63 Building,
and you don't know the King's age.

240
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,840
Who in the world are you?

241
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:13,590
Oh, did you live abroad for a long time?

242
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,680
But even so,

243
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,930
how could you be so indifferent
toward your home country?

244
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,850
Well...

245
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:22,850
This isn't my home country.

246
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:28,860
Well, my earth is still flat for me
so I can't explain.

247
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:32,400
Let's just say I'm an illegal immigrant.

248
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:35,570
Oh, my gosh.

249
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,500
Can you leave us? It won't take long.

250
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:54,920
She's an illegal immigrant.

251
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:02,060
Why are you smiling?

252
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:05,020
I know someone who looks like you,
but you're so different from him.

253
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:06,350
I'm sorry about earlier.

254
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:09,940
But were you always like this?

255
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:13,190
So prudent and serious?

256
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:15,190
Hold this.

257
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,860
I understand how you feel.
I went through that too.

258
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:37,220
I thought you'd need it,
so I made it easy for you.

259
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:39,010
I'm sure you won't find anything, though.

260
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:42,800
You can ask your boss why.

261
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:45,520
He's a science guy,
so he'd be better at explaining.

262
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,480
Are you

263
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,070
from a parallel universe?

264
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:56,110
Where the capital is Seoul,

265
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:59,280
and the country's name
is the Republic of Korea?

266
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:02,410
How do you know that?

267
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,160
Who are you?

268
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:11,330
What have you done to His Majesty?

269
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:14,960
Did you make that weird scar
on his shoulder too?

270
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:17,760
He has a scar on his shoulder?

271
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:22,680
I don't know anything about that.

272
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:25,560
We're not close enough to show
each other's backs.

273
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:29,310
And don't talk to me like that.

274
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:31,900
You were born in 1991, right?
I'm a year older than you.

275
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:37,690
Captain Jo.

276
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,760
I said I wanted the halls empty.

277
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:05,850
Your Majesty, I wanted to ask a few--

278
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:08,720
I know. I know you're curious

279
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:11,060
and I understand why you want
to check her fingerprints.

280
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:12,770
I'll send you a link.

281
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:14,690
It's about quantum mechanics.

282
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:17,440
Send me your questions by text
after reading it.

283
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:21,360
And will you open the door now?
The food is getting cold.

284
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:24,070
But Your Majesty.

285
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:26,870
Didn't you get any alcohol?

286
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,160
Your guest was asking for some.

287
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,000
Yeong.

288
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:36,040
Yes, Your Majesty.

289
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:40,170
Will you find out where the alcohol fridge
is located in the palace?

290
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:42,170
Pardon?

291
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:48,100
By the way,

292
00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:50,770
when do you think His Majesty saw me?

293
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:53,350
I greeted him,

294
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:57,150
but he said we'd met before
and that he was glad to see me.

295
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:00,530
I had never met him before.

296
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:06,360
Was there anything notable
about the woman in there?

297
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:08,700
-Except that she asked for alcohol.
-You shouldn't ask me.

298
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,330
I'm only going to report
to Head Court Lady Noh.

299
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:15,460
You're good at your job.

300
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:17,830
I feel so sad about

301
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,420
missing this great opportunity.

302
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:22,960
I have to go meet Head Court Lady Noh.

303
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:24,840
I'll be off, then.

304
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:39,150
-Did you just lock me up in here?
-I'm housing you.

305
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:40,770
So be understanding.

306
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:43,690
I brought you here
without saying anything.

307
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:47,360
Everyone's in a panic
because this has never happened before.

308
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:48,870
Why are you so calm, then?

309
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:52,740
I imagined bringing you here
lots of times before.

310
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,250
Although it wasn't like this.

311
00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:00,000
Did you make a contract or something?
Did you buy land?

312
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:06,260
I stopped myself from wiping it
on the wall because of your citizens.

313
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,840
You should promote that employee
who was watching me.

314
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:09,970
She's a real patriot.

315
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:13,310
Let me borrow your phone,
and give it to me unlocked.

316
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:15,640
She wouldn't lend me her phone.

317
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:17,940
What are you going to look up?

318
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,150
I'm sure you have nowhere to call.

319
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:22,860
None of your business.

320
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,030
What's your passcode?

321
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:26,110
Who would even try to look
through a King's phone?

322
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,150
It's not locked.

323
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:34,790
Pass me the snack.

324
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:36,290
It's not a snack, it's dinner.

325
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:39,580
I thought you would be hungry.

326
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:43,210
You try it first.

327
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:47,510
-What?
-I'm not joking.

328
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:49,800
I'm Alice in Wonderland right now.

329
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:53,260
She eats weird pills
and grows bigger and smaller and stuff.

330
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:56,270
What if I eat this and die from poisoning
or natural causes and stuff?

331
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,690
Don't worry.

332
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:01,440
I keep my promises.
You'll die from a beheading.

333
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:04,360
All right, then.

334
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:05,780
I'll enjoy the food.

335
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:16,450
You made this yourself?

336
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:19,210
Yes. Is it good?

337
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:21,000
No, it's bad.

338
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:27,800
I haven't done this for about 25 years,

339
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:29,840
but I should call my officials today.

340
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:33,090
In this world,
if I say "Anyone out there?",

341
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:35,510
everyone will come rushing...

342
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:38,850
Oh, gosh.

343
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:45,610
Were you really standing outside the door?

344
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:48,320
Do you think I have
that much time on my hands?

345
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:51,400
And you were here this whole time?

346
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,160
No, I came just a minute ago.

347
00:24:54,370 --> 00:24:55,580
I barely sat down.

348
00:24:57,910 --> 00:25:00,660
I prepared a bedroom and a meal
for your guest,

349
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:05,420
but since she seems to have eaten,
I will escort her to her room.

350
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:09,590
It is the farthest room from your room,
Your Majesty.

351
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,390
I'll see you tomorrow. Get some sleep.

352
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:30,320
I was talking to you.

353
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:32,950
You should really sleep well.

354
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:39,740
Is it far to the right
or to the left from my room?

355
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:42,330
My goodness!

356
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:55,430
Besides emergency situations,

357
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:58,510
outsiders hardly ever stay

358
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,680
in the palace overnight.

359
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:06,600
So you must never speak
about what happened today

360
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,310
anywhere or to anyone.

361
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:13,990
You must keep everything a secret,
such as the structure of the palace

362
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:17,410
or the private conversations
you've had with the King.

363
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:19,780
You don't need to worry about that.

364
00:26:20,290 --> 00:26:22,160
I'm a government official, too.

365
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:23,660
So I've seen.

366
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,460
Lieutenant Jeong Tae-eul.

367
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:34,380
I've been meaning to ask this.

368
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:36,590
How do you people

369
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:38,930
know me?

370
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:42,890
A lieutenant in the police force?

371
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:46,900
It is very strange.

372
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:53,190
His Majesty has had a strange ID card
since he was young.

373
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:59,530
There was no police officer named
Jeong Tae-eul in the Kingdom of Corea,

374
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:04,870
and there is no such rank
as a lieutenant in the police force here.

375
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:11,460
I thought that it was a fake ID
made as a joke or for some other reason,

376
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:14,590
but that nonexistent person

377
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:16,470
suddenly appeared here.

378
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:19,840
It's shocking.

379
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:24,430
Everything is just absurd,

380
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:26,850
but there is one thing I'm sure about.

381
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:32,020
An existence that cannot be explained
will only bring chaos to the world,

382
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,320
and it will only harm our King.

383
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:36,530
So

384
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,910
during your stay here,

385
00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:43,330
please try to avoid contact

386
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:48,120
with anyone besides the King,
the Chief of the Royal Guard, and me.

387
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:53,460
Furthermore,
don't get curious about this world,

388
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:55,880
and don't try to stay.

389
00:27:59,090 --> 00:28:00,640
And when I say "this world,"

390
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:03,470
that includes the King.

391
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:12,250
I was right.

392
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:14,380
It was far to the right.

393
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:21,720
I thought you'd be glad to see me.

394
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:23,510
You came empty-handed?

395
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:36,020
There's a bed and a sofa in here.
Why are you sitting on the floor?

396
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:39,480
There's a draft in here,
especially on the left side of the bed.

397
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,500
Why are you here?

398
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:58,630
I didn't want to leave you scared
all by yourself.

399
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,090
Trust me. I'm not a weird person here.

400
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:07,720
Why did you use the window
instead of the door if you're not weird?

401
00:30:09,890 --> 00:30:10,890
You should know...

402
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:12,640
That's the shortcut.

403
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,770
The palace is really big.

404
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,980
I thought you couldn't sit on the floor.

405
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:20,860
It's not so bad, actually.

406
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:24,650
And it feels kind of nice with the draft.

407
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:35,750
When are you going to show me my ID card?

408
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:41,130
-Tomorrow.
-Why tomorrow?

409
00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:43,420
Were you just pretending to have it?

410
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:44,920
I do have it.

411
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:48,010
You might try to go back to your world

412
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:50,850
if I show you.

413
00:30:58,270 --> 00:30:59,270
What is it?

414
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:01,690
What?

415
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,200
The doll on my car key.

416
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,500
It seems pretty cheap.

417
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:26,420
SHOOTING, ARCHERY

418
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:28,470
You can win this
if you hit the target seven times.

419
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:30,930
But if you've served in the military,

420
00:31:31,010 --> 00:31:32,930
it'll be a piece of cake.

421
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:35,890
It's 10,000 won for 10 bullets.
How many do you want?

422
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:37,270
I only need seven bullets.

423
00:31:56,910 --> 00:31:58,500
You should really know,

424
00:31:59,170 --> 00:32:01,790
nothing I have is cheap.

425
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:07,550
How much did you spend?

426
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:10,470
Anyone who's served in the military
can do it with their eyes closed.

427
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:11,470
I knew it.

428
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,720
Everyone in your country is a swindler.

429
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:18,850
Be quiet. There's someone
guarding the door outside.

430
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:22,310
Are you stupid?
There are dozens of security cameras here.

431
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:29,030
Is that a security camera?

432
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:30,910
Wave to them.

433
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:33,410
Twelve people are watching us right now.

434
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:35,870
For real?

435
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:41,620
You believe everything I say now.

436
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:43,750
That was a lie.

437
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:48,170
Are you kidding me?

438
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:51,510
So

439
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:54,050
is that really a security camera or not?

440
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:56,640
It isn't. I was just joking.

441
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:01,190
You want proof?

442
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:10,990
Move.

443
00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:14,450
This might look romantic,

444
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:17,080
but it's actually really uncomfortable.

445
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:20,290
No, it's not uncomfortable at all.

446
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:29,840
I'm going to ask you something,
so just answer with yes or no.

447
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:32,300
Okay.

448
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:34,930
You've never dated before, right?

449
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:38,140
You startled me.

450
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:40,930
Yes,

451
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,350
I have.

452
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:44,480
Should I guess when?

453
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:46,400
Guess.

454
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,320
Now.

455
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,450
Should I have done this?

456
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:21,430
Try guessing what I just proved.

457
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:23,890
The fact that I've dated before?

458
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,350
Or

459
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:28,270
that I'm dating right now?

460
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,550
Did Squad Two find the weapon used
in their murder case?

461
00:34:55,930 --> 00:34:58,260
Chief Choe is begging me to help him out.

462
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:02,060
I just handed the information over.
It's a common kitchen knife.

463
00:35:02,890 --> 00:35:03,810
Right.

464
00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:06,020
It'd be about this size.

465
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:06,980
I see.

466
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:13,650
Here, here, and here.

467
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:17,200
And made sure the victim would die.

468
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:21,580
Why is the world so dark?

469
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:23,490
Let's live a bright life.

470
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:25,120
As bright as a light bulb.

471
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:30,630
I can't possibly be bright when
my husband is leaving home at this hour.

472
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:33,840
Come on, I don't want to leave.

473
00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:36,920
But I can't help it.
Sin-jae asked for just one glass...

474
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:39,840
Don't make me work
after work hours have passed.

475
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:43,720
I can check your call records
within ten minutes.

476
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:48,310
Honey, wait. I'll push that.

477
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:49,230
No, I'll do it.

478
00:35:49,310 --> 00:35:51,060
Honey, then could I put that in the car

479
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:52,940
and just take a taxi
in front of the building?

480
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:54,480
VIOLENT CRIMES DIVISION SQUAD 3

481
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:13,340
CHIEF PARK

482
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:17,590
I'm having a drink with you today.

483
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,010
Who are you actually meeting, then?

484
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:27,140
Loneliness.

485
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:37,490
I'M BORED, LET'S PLAY POOL

486
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:52,830
I told you to sleep well,
but I guess you didn't.

487
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,000
It's a Royal Guard uniform.

488
00:36:58,420 --> 00:36:59,840
You want me to run away in disguise?

489
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:02,340
I won't let you do that.

490
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:05,350
I have a full schedule today.

491
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:07,680
Get dressed and come out.

492
00:37:07,890 --> 00:37:09,310
We have to leave
without Head Court Lady Noh noticing.

493
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,730
If that was your plan,
you should've been more meticulous.

494
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,450
My goodness, gracious.

495
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:30,750
I made sure to separate you,
but you came here this early.

496
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:34,250
Right, I guess it's better for you
to go outside.

497
00:37:34,830 --> 00:37:37,290
Come back as late as you can.

498
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:40,590
And don't get any photos taken.
No photos together!

499
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:43,880
My goodness.

500
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:51,640
This was my plan all along.

501
00:37:52,350 --> 00:37:53,850
I've succeeded.

502
00:37:56,770 --> 00:37:58,400
You said you weren't a weird person here.

503
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
IT'S MY VERY FIRST TIME
SEEING HIS MAJESTY IN PERSON!

504
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:31,680
His Majesty will

505
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:34,810
make the first throw
for our victory today.

506
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,770
Please give a round of applause.

507
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:50,910
Please give a round of applause

508
00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:54,830
and a loud cheer for the King
who did the first throw for us.

509
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:02,840
The architect Richard Fuller said,

510
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:05,590
"When I find a solution to a problem,

511
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:10,600
I know that I am wrong if the solution
is not beautiful."

512
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:13,770
So I'm giving you this advice

513
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:18,850
as an amateur mathematician
and also as your King.

514
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,230
WALK

515
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,240
Leave your lab
for at least 30 minutes a day.

516
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:27,660
Your labs

517
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:29,910
need to be cleaned.

518
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:38,120
Get plenty of rest.

519
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:41,710
Your bodies are not infinite decimals.

520
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,510
ATMOSPHERE

521
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:49,260
Share beautiful moments
with your lovers or family.

522
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:52,760
Even mathematicians can do it.

523
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:06,940
You are all proud mathematicians
of the Kingdom of Corea.

524
00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:09,360
Whatever problem you are working on,

525
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:12,910
I hope your solution and your answer

526
00:40:14,490 --> 00:40:15,790
are both beautiful.

527
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:35,220
Wasn't I cool?

528
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:39,060
Yes, you were.

529
00:40:40,850 --> 00:40:41,690
I think so, too.

530
00:40:41,770 --> 00:40:43,770
I've thought that for a long time.

531
00:40:56,910 --> 00:40:57,790
Captain Jo.

532
00:40:57,870 --> 00:40:59,460
Please do as I requested.

533
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:06,800
Can you look this way, please?

534
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,560
It doesn't seem to be a present.

535
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:18,970
"I got you out of the palace
since you might stay locked up

536
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:20,520
in the study.

537
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:22,440
Have fun. I'll see you in the evening."

538
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:26,650
That is what His Majesty said.

539
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:30,490
His Majesty has other duties to attend to,
so you're on your own now.

540
00:41:37,790 --> 00:41:38,700
"Oh, thanks.

541
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:40,960
It's totally my style."

542
00:41:42,370 --> 00:41:43,920
Tell him I said that.

543
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:47,630
But...

544
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:50,050
Do you have some money?

545
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:54,640
I bought your boss
chicken and stuff in the other world.

546
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,440
It takes about 50 minutes
to the disaster area.

547
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:12,240
The relief supplies
have been delivered by train.

00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:09,460
It's fine, just go.

556
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,550
You should accept my help.

557
00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:13,920
Did you receive the photos?

558
00:43:22,470 --> 00:43:24,180
What are these? Did you send these?

559
00:43:25,390 --> 00:43:26,560
Did you photoshop me?

560
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:28,730
You're crazy.

561
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:32,150
This must be a new scamming method,
but you've chosen the wrong person.

562
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:37,740
I don't even have money
to buy pills to kill myself.

563
00:43:38,530 --> 00:43:42,080
Born on July 12th, 1989.

How do you know my birthdate?

565
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:50,330
The granddaughter of the founder
of a large pharmaceutical company.

Marries the first son of a rich family

567

after meeting him
at a yacht club in America.

568
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:59,890
And the first baby
is born after four months.

569
00:44:01,010 --> 00:44:03,930
This is your life.

570
00:44:05,470 --> 00:44:07,480
If you want it to be.

571
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:14,530
I've never chosen the wrong person.

572
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:19,360
The woman in these photos is you.

573
00:44:20,990 --> 00:44:21,820
To be exact,

574
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:24,410
it's you in another world.

575
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,540
In this world,

576
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:33,090
you're living in hell.

577
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:53,980
How did you get these photos?

578
00:44:54,770 --> 00:44:57,230
Did you come into my house?

579
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:59,280
You have a useless lock,

580
00:45:00,490 --> 00:45:02,700
a window with no sunlight coming through,

581
00:45:03,370 --> 00:45:05,660
and walls that can't protect you
from the cold nor the heat.

582
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:07,790
Is that house any different

583
00:45:08,410 --> 00:45:09,500
from a grave?

584
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,670
How about giving your daughter

585
00:45:13,670 --> 00:45:15,710
a house, a car,

586
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:18,920
and parents like this?

587
00:45:20,670 --> 00:45:24,470
Instead of used garbage like that.

588
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:29,640
How do you know it's a girl?

589
00:45:33,190 --> 00:45:34,310
You...

590
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:37,900
Whether you're a swindler or a member
of a cult, you've got the wrong person.

591
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:39,230
I'm sending you to jail.

592
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:43,240
112 crime report. How may I help you?

593
00:45:47,830 --> 00:45:49,200
Hello? You may speak.

594
00:45:56,750 --> 00:45:58,130
Who are you?

595
00:45:58,710 --> 00:46:00,920
Someone who's going to save your life.

596
00:46:01,510 --> 00:46:02,800
How are you going to do that?

597
00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:06,890
What do I have to do

598
00:46:10,970 --> 00:46:12,230
to get that?

599
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:15,770
You just have to kill the other you.

600
00:46:18,270 --> 00:46:19,650
All right, then...

601
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:25,360
Would you like to change

602
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:27,660
your miserable life?

603
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:31,660
What are you going to do

604
00:46:32,290 --> 00:46:33,250
if I say no?

605
00:46:33,830 --> 00:46:35,290
I already saw your face.

606
00:46:37,290 --> 00:46:38,420
Am I going to die

607
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:40,300
instead of

608
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:41,840
her?

609
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:44,510
Well, I haven't thought about that yet.

610
00:46:45,930 --> 00:46:50,010
Nobody has refused until now.

611
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:57,900
It's okay

612
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:00,940
for you to be the first exception.

613
00:47:02,730 --> 00:47:04,190
It'll be interesting to me.

614
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:08,200
Wait.

615
00:47:08,530 --> 00:47:10,740
Wait...

616
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:15,120
How

617
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,920
should I contact you?

618
00:47:29,390 --> 00:47:30,550
I'll be the one

619
00:47:31,350 --> 00:47:32,720
to contact you.

620
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:37,350
It's an urgent report from
the Ministry of National Defense.

621
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:39,690
A Chinese fishing boat
sent a distress signal

622
00:47:39,770 --> 00:47:41,650
in the intermediate zone of the East Sea.

623
00:47:41,730 --> 00:47:44,610
The Yi Sun-sin Destroyer
that was nearby received the signal.

624
00:47:45,650 --> 00:47:46,860
Are they sure it's a fishing boat?

625
00:47:46,950 --> 00:47:48,200
Yes, they confirmed it.

626
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:51,700
They say it must've been stranded
because of the severe fog and swells.

627
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:53,580
This happened last spring as well.

628
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:56,660
The Japanese Navy
could interfere again, right?

629
00:47:56,830 --> 00:47:59,790
Yes, after Japan broke off
the EEZ agreement,

630
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:02,130
both Japan and China
are sensitive about such things.

631
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:03,840
Let's just think simply.

632
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,300
We'll be more aggressive
at the next negotiation with Japan,

633
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:08,340
and rescue those people
since we got the signal.

634
00:48:08,930 --> 00:48:12,350
And tell our people to ask them
why they keep fishing in our waters.

635
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:15,060
Yes, ma'am.

636

CERTIFICATE OF APPOINTMENT
KOO SEO-RYEONG

637
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:31,910
The King of the Kingdom of Corea

638
00:48:32,450 --> 00:48:33,870
accepts the people's decision

639
00:48:34,490 --> 00:48:37,250
and allows Prime Minister Koo
to form the Cabinet.

640
00:48:42,630 --> 00:48:44,670
I hope you become a Prime Minister
who values the citizens.

641
00:48:46,710 --> 00:48:48,420
I will do my best, Your Majesty.

642
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:53,430
What kind of Prime Minister
should I be to you?

643
00:48:56,310 --> 00:48:59,480
Please be a Prime Minister
who mostly gives written reports.

644
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:10,450
Prime Minister Koo.

645
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:12,450
I can never be indebted to you.

646
00:49:13,070 --> 00:49:15,660
Let's wait and see how my absence
will be historically recorded

647
00:49:16,830 --> 00:49:18,200
in the pages of history books.

My gosh, no way.

650
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:24,350
Oh, I'm sorry.

651
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:25,270
It's fine.

652
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:32,740
KINGDOM OF COREA MAINTAINS
4TH HIGHEST GDP IN THE WORLD

653
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:34,150
Fourth?

654
00:50:36,410 --> 00:50:37,490
The Republic...

655
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:41,160
I mean, the Kingdom of Corea's
GDP is that high?

656
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:44,000
We export rare-earth elements
internationally.

657
00:50:44,710 --> 00:50:45,870
It's even in school textbooks.

658
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:49,840
I'm sorry, but what are
rare-earth elements?

659
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:52,090
It's always mentioned in exams.

660
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:54,260
Cerium, lanthanum, yttrium, samarium...

661
00:50:57,050 --> 00:50:58,180
Are you a foreigner?

662
00:51:00,890 --> 00:51:02,720
Yeah, something like that.

663
00:51:03,890 --> 00:51:05,980
So, what are they?

664
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:07,850
Well, they're minerals.

665
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:12,030
There are 30 million tons
just in the northern area, and in the sea.

666
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:15,780
Anyway, those minerals in the northern
area are worth 20 billion dollars a ton,

667
00:51:15,860 --> 00:51:18,110
so it'd be about six quintillion dollars.

668
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:22,040
And that's all owned
by the Kingdom of Corea?

669
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:23,370
Oh, no.

670
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:26,580
The mountains where they're buried
are owned by the royal court,

671
00:51:27,620 --> 00:51:29,250
so they're actually the King's.

672
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:36,880
It's a diamond?

673
00:51:37,630 --> 00:51:40,390
If that's a diamond, I'm Princess Diana.

674
00:51:41,430 --> 00:51:42,310
A king?

675
00:51:42,810 --> 00:51:45,730
You're a total nutjob.
This is so ridiculous.

676
00:51:49,270 --> 00:51:51,110
ROYAL COURT OF KINGDOM OF COREA

677
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:54,360
You're really one
or the other, aren't you?

678
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:10,290
CTX MOUNT KUMGANG NATIONAL PARK

CTX TRAINS
TO MOKPO TO MOUNT PAEKTU

681
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:25,020
The CTX train

682
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:29,810
bound for Pyongyang is ready to depart
on platform number three.

683
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:31,400
BUSAN STATION TO SEOUL STATION

684
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:34,400
Passengers, please check the ticket

685
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:36,650
and board the train immediately.

686
00:52:37,650 --> 00:52:39,280
Sir. Over there.

687
00:52:44,660 --> 00:52:47,200
Hey, look who it is. Isn't that Luna?

688
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,410
She even changed her hairstyle.

689
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,080
-Hey.
-Yes, sir.

690
00:52:51,170 --> 00:52:52,330
-Get her.
-Yes, sir.

691
00:52:55,420 --> 00:52:57,800
Who are you to block my way?
Do you have a death wish?

692
00:52:57,960 --> 00:52:59,340
You're...

693
00:52:59,420 --> 00:53:00,550
Yes, I'm Jo Yeong.

694
00:53:01,930 --> 00:53:02,930
You got out quickly.

695
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:06,560
-What did you say that woman's name was?
-Luna.

696
00:53:07,140 --> 00:53:08,810
You know, the one
we were chasing last time.

697
00:53:08,890 --> 00:53:09,890
Are you sure?

698
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:11,390
She took off with our boss' money

699
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:13,860
and even got a new hairstyle with it.
How could we forget her?

700
00:53:14,230 --> 00:53:16,520
Our boss is still in jail because of her.

701
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:18,860
-But that bitch is wandering around--
-All right. Get lost.

702
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:20,650
She's my guest for now.

703
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:22,200
Don't make me repeat myself.

704
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:55,520
Prime Minister, you're so pretty!

705
00:53:55,610 --> 00:53:56,860
You're so pretty!

706
00:53:57,110 --> 00:53:58,820
Prime Minister, you're so pretty!

707
00:53:58,900 --> 00:54:02,530
RELATIVE SEARCH RESULTS TO LEE GON,
LEE GON AND KOO SEO-RYEONG MARRIAGE

708
00:54:02,610 --> 00:54:04,360
Prime Minister, make sure to eat well.

709
00:54:04,450 --> 00:54:05,950
-Love you all!
-Me too, Prime Minister!

710
00:54:06,030 --> 00:54:07,200
Stay healthy!

711
00:54:13,870 --> 00:54:15,960
You're six months pregnant,
but you still look slim.

712
00:54:16,130 --> 00:54:18,170
I watch my figure even more than
before I got married.

713
00:54:18,290 --> 00:54:19,880
My husband didn't want me to gain weight.

714
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,800
Right, don't end up like me.

715
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:23,880
My husband cheated on me

716
00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:25,840
when I was seven months pregnant.

717
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:30,180
Excuse me.

718
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:32,060
I guess Seo-ryeong is coming.

719
00:54:32,350 --> 00:54:34,980
I've just lost my appetite.
Did she have to come?

720
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:36,600
I'm leaving first.

721
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:38,230
-You're leaving?
-Yeah.

722
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:47,620
Did she just leave?

723
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:49,370
She said she lost her appetite.

724
00:54:49,990 --> 00:54:52,540
The food isn't even served yet.
That's nonsense.

725
00:54:52,790 --> 00:54:53,910
Didn't you know?

726
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,080
Congressman Park Cheol-ung,
the one involved in the sex scandal.

727
00:54:56,170 --> 00:54:57,460
He's her sister-in-law's brother-in-law.

728
00:54:57,540 --> 00:54:58,790
So what?

729
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:00,500
I barely remember my sister-in-law's face.

730
00:55:00,590 --> 00:55:03,550
Bad things keep happening
to people who oppose you.

731
00:55:04,670 --> 00:55:08,300
Rumors say the only one
who benefits from the scandal is you.

732
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:10,560
The person who benefits the most

733
00:55:10,970 --> 00:55:11,930
is usually the culprit.

734
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:15,440
It's just that the people who oppose me
happen to have dark secrets.

735
00:55:16,230 --> 00:55:19,480
My husband says Prince Buyeong
has your back.

736
00:55:19,940 --> 00:55:21,780
-Is that true?
-What if it is?

737
00:55:22,230 --> 00:55:23,860
Does he want to take sides with me?

738
00:55:24,490 --> 00:55:25,530
Can he?

739
00:55:26,610 --> 00:55:28,410
Are the Royal Family your in-laws now?

740
00:55:28,990 --> 00:55:30,530
Is that why you're serving another term?

741
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:31,950
You really think she can?

742
00:55:32,370 --> 00:55:35,580
That "I studied while selling fish"
doesn't work anymore.

743
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,130
A queen with no term limit is better

744
00:55:39,250 --> 00:55:41,460
than a Prime Minister
with a five-year term.

745
00:55:41,540 --> 00:55:44,460
But I'm not sure
if His Majesty likes old women.

746
00:55:46,590 --> 00:55:49,260
Do you want to see
if it still works or not?

747
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:52,850
What will you do if the priority
for the remainder of my term

748
00:55:52,930 --> 00:55:55,680
is to do a tax investigation into
your husband's company, Sungwoon Group?

749
00:55:56,980 --> 00:55:59,690
What'll you do
if I obsess over that like a lunatic?

750
00:56:02,980 --> 00:56:04,230
Aren't you going to leave?

751
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:09,030
I don't think our conversation
will be good for your baby.

752
00:56:12,950 --> 00:56:13,950
Auntie's sorry about that.

753
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:43,440
SEOUL JONGNO POLICE STATION

754
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:00,460
Excuse me.

755
00:57:03,630 --> 00:57:06,130
Don't you know me?

756
00:57:07,130 --> 00:57:08,050
It's Jeong Tae-eul.

757
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:09,630
Don't you know?

758
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:10,720
Well...

759
00:57:11,010 --> 00:57:12,050
Do you know her?

760
00:57:16,310 --> 00:57:18,060
No, I don't. Who are you?

761
00:57:18,140 --> 00:57:20,640
Then what about Kang Sin-jae? Or Jangmi?

762
00:57:20,890 --> 00:57:23,310
Or what about Director Kim Hee-ju
from Forensics?

763
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:25,150
I'm not sure who they are.

764
00:57:25,230 --> 00:57:27,860
The names sound like
they are kind-hearted people...

765
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:29,400
What is this about?

766
00:57:30,070 --> 00:57:31,200
Are you visiting the station?

767
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:34,530
Are you a detective?

768
00:57:37,580 --> 00:57:40,210
No, it's nothing. I guess I was mistaken.

769
00:57:41,540 --> 00:57:43,120
Enjoy your meal.

770
00:57:44,210 --> 00:57:45,290
-All right.
-Oh, okay.

771
00:57:49,260 --> 00:57:52,180
You've been on the news
too often these days.

772
00:57:52,470 --> 00:57:55,390
Yeah, I was so shocked.
I look so good on screen.

773
00:57:55,470 --> 00:57:56,300
You looked so cool.

774
00:57:56,390 --> 00:57:58,100
What do you want to eat?
I want ox bone soup.

775
00:57:58,180 --> 00:57:59,470
I want ox knee soup.

776
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:04,650
Hey, but how did she know
we were on our way to eat?

777
00:58:11,950 --> 00:58:12,900
Bye.

778
00:58:17,950 --> 00:58:20,330
-Let's eat ox knee soup.
-All right. There's a place I know.

779
00:58:20,410 --> 00:58:24,120
It's been there for 50 years, and
the bone soup tastes just like knee soup.

780
00:58:24,210 --> 00:58:25,420
Don't be ridiculous.

781
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:46,350
If he hasn't become a detective...

782
00:58:47,860 --> 00:58:48,730
Right...

783
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:51,150
It means his family didn't get bankrupt.

784
00:58:52,490 --> 00:58:54,950
The Kang Sin-jae of the Kingdom of Corea

785
00:58:55,780 --> 00:58:56,780
is so cool.

786
00:59:00,540 --> 00:59:01,540
Wow.

787
01:00:19,070 --> 01:00:19,950
Oh, hey.

788
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:22,280
I'm running into you often lately.

789
01:00:23,490 --> 01:00:24,700
And you're still eating sweets.

790
01:00:25,290 --> 01:00:28,250
I don't eat sweets that often,
but I keep getting caught eating them.

791
01:00:29,580 --> 01:00:32,090
-What are you doing in this neighborhood?
-I live around here.

792
01:00:34,250 --> 01:00:36,340
Well, I used to live around here.

793
01:00:38,050 --> 01:00:39,430
I guess you're having a gathering today.

794
01:00:41,430 --> 01:00:42,800
I'm just going to have some drinks.

795
01:00:43,220 --> 01:00:45,180
This won't be enough
if I start drinking in the daytime.

796
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:46,970
Do you want one?

797
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:58,900
Is it okay for a psychiatrist
to be an alcoholic?

798
01:01:00,820 --> 01:01:02,990
I'm not that dependent.
I have a high alcohol tolerance.

799
01:01:04,530 --> 01:01:06,290
But are sweets really effective?

800
01:01:08,750 --> 01:01:10,830
It's just nice
because it's sweet and melts fast.

801
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:13,380
Isn't it better for it to melt
slowly if it's sweet?

802
01:01:13,630 --> 01:01:14,750
It's going to melt anyway.

803
01:01:18,340 --> 01:01:19,880
By the way, what's your job?

804
01:01:21,130 --> 01:01:24,390
I thought I'd ask you at the next session,
but you didn't come.

805
01:01:26,470 --> 01:01:28,470
-I'm a detective.
-Really?

806
01:01:29,310 --> 01:01:31,060
I guessed totally wrong.

807
01:01:32,190 --> 01:01:34,770
-I thought you were a gangster.
-What kind of psychiatrist...

808
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:37,860
That's why the meds didn't work.

809
01:01:37,940 --> 01:01:39,780
You probably didn't even take them.

810
01:01:41,950 --> 01:01:43,870
When did you move away
from this neighborhood?

811
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:47,120
I've always lived here,
so we could've run into each other...

812
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:54,880
Yes. I told you that my family
got bankrupt when I was little.

813
01:01:56,540 --> 01:01:58,130
We moved out when I was in middle school.

814
01:02:00,510 --> 01:02:02,130
The house prices here
went up a lot, right?

815
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:05,550
I visit here sometimes,
but I feel so bitter.

816
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:10,560
What do you think makes you
keep returning to this place?

817
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:14,850
Do you still have
the same recurring nightmares?

818
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:20,030
Don't start a session
so suddenly like this.

819
01:02:20,900 --> 01:02:22,610
Especially when you're drinking.

820
01:02:23,030 --> 01:02:24,660
You're treating me like some quack.

821
01:02:27,330 --> 01:02:28,830
All right, let's just drink then.

822
01:02:44,550 --> 01:02:47,510
I'M BORED, LET'S PLAY POOL

823
01:02:49,890 --> 01:02:50,930
Jeong who?

824
01:02:51,430 --> 01:02:52,390
SUIM ORIENTAL CLINIC

825
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:54,060
Jeong Do-in.

826
01:02:54,560 --> 01:02:57,860
He's a Taekwondo instructor
at a Taekwondo center.

827
01:02:58,480 --> 01:02:59,940
I don't know anyone by that name.

828
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:04,150
Then...

829
01:03:07,490 --> 01:03:11,700
How about a woman named Ahn Bong-hui?

830
01:03:12,830 --> 01:03:13,790
Do you know her?

831
01:03:13,870 --> 01:03:15,870
Her face looks really similar to mine.

832
01:03:16,080 --> 01:03:18,420
Have you ever seen her?

833
01:03:19,290 --> 01:03:20,500
Ahn Bong-hui?

834
01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:22,510
No, I haven't.

835
01:03:23,090 --> 01:03:25,050
We've lived here for 30 years.

836
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:27,800
Why? Did they say they live here?

837
01:03:29,050 --> 01:03:30,810
No, never mind. Thank you.

838
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:45,110
It's 41,800 won.

839
01:03:45,240 --> 01:03:46,280
Oh, right. One second.

840
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:58,870
I'm sorry, but how much
is a standing ticket?

841
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,380
It's 34,800 won.

842
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:08,840
I rode a taxi
without thinking about the ticket.

843
01:04:09,840 --> 01:04:13,430
I'm sorry,
but is there a bus terminal in Gangnam?

844
01:04:14,060 --> 01:04:15,060
There's one in Songpa-gu.

845
01:04:15,810 --> 01:04:18,730
But even if you go now,
you'd miss the last bus.

846
01:04:19,230 --> 01:04:20,480
Don't you have a card?

847
01:04:26,150 --> 01:04:29,240
I'm telling you, it's not a prank call!

848
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:30,740
I really know Lee Gon...

849
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:35,580
I mean, the King... I know the King.

850
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:38,120
Okay? I'm an acquaintance.

851
01:04:38,460 --> 01:04:39,330
I...

852
01:04:44,050 --> 01:04:45,590
I'm really serious.

853
01:04:46,710 --> 01:04:48,760
I just need to talk to him for one minute.

854
01:04:52,470 --> 01:04:55,850
I'm short of 2,600 won,

855
01:04:56,680 --> 01:04:59,310
so I can't return to Busan right now.

856
01:05:04,650 --> 01:05:05,610
Just ten seconds.

857
01:05:05,690 --> 01:05:08,240
Please, just ten seconds. I...

858
01:05:15,790 --> 01:05:16,660
Who

859
01:05:18,250 --> 01:05:19,960
did you say it was just now?

860
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:22,210
Well, Your Majesty,

861
01:05:22,830 --> 01:05:25,340
some woman called
the Royal Court's main number

862
01:05:25,420 --> 01:05:27,420
seventeen times, asking for you.

863
01:05:28,340 --> 01:05:30,220
-The security team was checking--
-No,

864
01:05:31,430 --> 01:05:33,090
I mean the name of the caller.

865
01:05:34,430 --> 01:05:36,680
Well, she said she was Princess Diana.

866
01:05:37,140 --> 01:05:39,730
They tracked her location just in case,
and she's at Seoul Station.

867
01:05:42,270 --> 01:05:43,190
Turn the helicopter.

868
01:05:44,110 --> 01:05:45,230
We're going to Seoul.

869
01:05:46,150 --> 01:05:47,230
Pardon?

870
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:50,110
Check Captain Jo's location right now.

871
01:05:50,190 --> 01:05:51,110
Yes, Your Majesty.

872
01:06:13,430 --> 01:06:14,340
Oh, my gosh.

873
01:06:17,050 --> 01:06:18,060
What are you doing here?

874
01:06:18,140 --> 01:06:19,680
I received orders from the King.

875
01:06:20,680 --> 01:06:22,730
He said you must be kept alive
until your beheading.

876
01:06:26,860 --> 01:06:29,400
But do you even really behead people here?

877
01:06:30,030 --> 01:06:32,990
It hasn't happened since 1920, but...

878
01:06:34,950 --> 01:06:36,740
it seems like it could happen again soon.

879
01:06:36,820 --> 01:06:38,080
My gosh.

880
01:06:40,370 --> 01:06:41,620
Who are you, really?

881
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:43,330
Are you really a detective?

882
01:06:44,420 --> 01:06:46,330
Why did you go
to the police station earlier?

883
01:06:48,590 --> 01:06:49,800
Were you following me?

884
01:06:51,550 --> 01:06:52,380
Follow me.

885
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:44,600
I heard you were looking for me.

886
01:07:45,810 --> 01:07:46,690
Yes.

887
01:07:46,770 --> 01:07:47,900
Seventeen times.

888
01:07:48,810 --> 01:07:49,730
Yes.

889
01:07:49,810 --> 01:07:51,650
I thought you were going to stay in Busan.

890
01:07:52,190 --> 01:07:53,650
Why did you come so far?

891
01:07:55,570 --> 01:07:57,280
Did you get to find Ahn Bong-hui?

892
01:07:57,570 --> 01:07:58,570
How did you know?

893
01:08:01,700 --> 01:08:03,830
Since when were you following me?

894
01:08:03,990 --> 01:08:06,210
You should have lent me money
if you were there all along.

895
01:08:07,830 --> 01:08:08,750
Who is she?

896
01:08:09,380 --> 01:08:12,000
Who are you looking for in this world?

897
01:08:16,590 --> 01:08:17,720
My mom.

898
01:08:19,840 --> 01:08:21,390
If this is a parallel world...

899
01:08:22,140 --> 01:08:25,100
And since Na-ri and Eun-sup are both here,

900
01:08:26,730 --> 01:08:28,810
although I might not exist...

901
01:08:31,060 --> 01:08:32,650
my mother could still be alive.

902
01:08:34,280 --> 01:08:35,860
I know she is someone else,

903
01:08:37,570 --> 01:08:39,410
but I didn't want her to be sick
in this world.

904
01:08:40,490 --> 01:08:43,700
I only have memories of her
from when I was five.

905
01:08:46,120 --> 01:08:47,830
So I just wanted to watch her from afar.

906
01:08:48,540 --> 01:08:49,920
That's why I came here.

907
01:08:52,130 --> 01:08:53,540
You should have told me.

908
01:08:54,460 --> 01:08:55,670
I was just curious.

909
01:08:56,710 --> 01:08:57,840
But she wasn't there.

910
01:08:59,470 --> 01:09:00,340
Anyway...

911
01:09:00,590 --> 01:09:03,680
I had fun today because of you.

912
01:09:04,260 --> 01:09:05,680
Is that why you searched for KTX?

913
01:09:06,310 --> 01:09:07,770
I was wondering what KTX is.

914
01:09:09,140 --> 01:09:10,560
Search?

915
01:09:13,060 --> 01:09:14,190
He didn't tell me that.

916
01:09:14,860 --> 01:09:16,530
The auto-save function told me.

917
01:09:17,570 --> 01:09:19,570
You were curious about a lot of things.

918
01:09:20,320 --> 01:09:22,360
Why were you curious about
Lee Gon's ex-girlfriend?

919
01:09:23,030 --> 01:09:24,450
Didn't you think
that I never had a girlfriend?

920
01:09:26,660 --> 01:09:29,040
Why would you read that?

921
01:09:29,750 --> 01:09:30,620
That's cheating.

922
01:09:32,790 --> 01:09:34,460
Your Majesty, Prime Minister Koo is--

923
01:09:34,540 --> 01:09:37,090
Right. You looked up
Prime Minister Koo as well.

924
01:09:37,170 --> 01:09:38,710
That was because...

925
01:09:39,420 --> 01:09:43,220
Because I heard she was
the youngest female Prime Minister.

926
01:09:43,300 --> 01:09:45,760
I only looked up her name
because I was amazed by that.

927
01:09:47,260 --> 01:09:48,680
Why? Do you feel guilty?

928
01:09:48,770 --> 01:09:50,270
I meet her every Friday.

929
01:09:51,850 --> 01:09:52,770
Is she IU?

930
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:01,740
Yes, it's Prime Minister Koo.

931
01:10:02,360 --> 01:10:05,780
She probably got a report
that your helicopter landed in Seoul.

932
01:10:35,810 --> 01:10:38,360
I'm seeing you at an unexpected hour,
in an unexpected place,

933
01:10:39,780 --> 01:10:41,360
with an unexpected person, Your Majesty.

934
01:10:42,190 --> 01:10:43,070
You're right.

935
01:10:43,570 --> 01:10:45,570
And you've put me in an awkward situation.

936
01:10:47,740 --> 01:10:48,580
Nice to meet you.

937
01:10:49,870 --> 01:10:52,040
I'm Koo Seo-ryeong,
Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Corea.

938
01:11:50,550 --> 01:11:52,350
