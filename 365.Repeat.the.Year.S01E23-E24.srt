more special than ever.</b>

314
00:27:39,069 --> 00:27:42,216
<b>I got to witness
even the sound of your breaths...</b>

315
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,710
<b>right by your side.</b>

316
00:27:44,539 --> 00:27:46,825
<b>So after you used Ms. Lee Shin
as your front...</b>

317
00:27:46,849 --> 00:27:48,386
<b>and watched everything unfold,</b>

318
00:27:48,410 --> 00:27:50,619
<b>did you feel like
you became a deity or something?</b>

319
00:27:51,349 --> 00:27:52,849
<b>A deity?</b>

320
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:03,730
<b>No deity will tell you
your fate before it happens.</b>

321
00:28:06,299 --> 00:28:08,099
<b>I already told everyone
about their fate.</b>

322
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,640
<b>You received the card.</b>

323
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,980
<b>Who do you think it'll be
among those two?</b>

324
00:28:22,279 --> 00:28:23,950
<b>About Detective Ji.</b>

325
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:34,259
<b>(Final Episode)</b>

326
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,379
<b>How did you know I was here?</b>

327
00:28:50,609 --> 00:28:52,510
<b>Today is your daughter's
death anniversary.</b>

328
00:28:53,879 --> 00:28:55,649
<b>You and I have repeated...</b>

329
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,420
<b>the year several times now.</b>

330
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:01,719
<b>Were you...</b>

331
00:29:03,719 --> 00:29:05,689
<b>really going to kill Young?</b>

332
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,359
<b>Did the professor
order you to do it?</b>

333
00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:09,929
<b>Is that so?</b>

334
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,259
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

335
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,500
<b>You know how much pain...</b>

336
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:17,740
<b>she suffered from
better than anyone.</b>

337
00:29:18,439 --> 00:29:19,899
<b>How could you do this to her?</b>

338
00:29:20,369 --> 00:29:21,570
<b>How?</b>

339
00:29:24,109 --> 00:29:27,950
<b>That was the only way
for me to see my daughter too.</b>

340
00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:32,049
<b>What did you say?</b>

341
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:36,819
<b>He promised to take me with him...</b>

342
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:38,760
<b>for the next reset.</b>

343
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:41,189
<b>But your daughter died
three years ago.</b>

344
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:46,159
<b>You can only go back a year.</b>

345
00:29:47,569 --> 00:29:49,469
<b>Did he leave that out to you?</b>

346
00:29:57,709 --> 00:29:59,739
<b>All clinical tests...</b>

347
00:30:00,109 --> 00:30:02,150
<b>come with side effects.</b>

348
00:30:02,450 --> 00:30:03,680
<b>What do you mean?</b>

349
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:06,150
<b>Wait, will you do that to Young?</b>

350
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:08,080
<b>No, I can't do that
even if I knew the reason.</b>

351
00:30:08,519 --> 00:30:10,519
<b>I can't take things this far.</b>

352
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:11,719
<b>You will...</b>

353
00:30:12,659 --> 00:30:14,189
<b>end up doing it,</b>

354
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:16,689
<b>because you always have.</b>

355
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:21,469
<b>(Ms. Song)</b>

356
00:30:24,469 --> 00:30:26,569
<b>Have you been killing Young
all this time?</b>

357
00:30:26,739 --> 00:30:28,310
<b>Every single year?</b>

358
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,640
<b>Because you need me for the reset,</b>

359
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:33,109
<b>did you sacrifice my daughter?</b>

360
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:36,426
<b>I only did it for you, Shin.</b>

361
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:37,825
<b>For me?</b>

362
00:30:37,849 --> 00:30:42,120
<b>How long do you think
your daughter can live?</b>

363
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:43,596
<b>Just because she's alive now,</b>

364
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:46,259
<b>does it mean she'll last
one more month or year?</b>

365
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:51,000
<b>Before she dies, do you think
someone will develop the cure?</b>

366
00:30:53,599 --> 00:30:56,930
<b>As a doctor, you know the answer
better than anyone.</b>

367
00:30:58,770 --> 00:31:02,569
<b>I didn't want you to make
a difficult decision.</b>

368
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:04,816
<b>I didn't want you
to rely on an uncertain future...</b>

369
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,485
<b>and be foolish enough to give up...</b>

370
00:31:06,509 --> 00:31:08,226
<b>living the perfect year.</b>

371
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:11,319
<b>You should have at least given me
a chance to decide.</b>

372
00:31:14,819 --> 00:31:16,520
<b>About Detective Ji.</b>

373
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:20,490
<b>Aren't you curious
about how he'll die?</b>

374
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,746
<b>You know, Samo Pharmaceuticals
where Professor Hwang is working at?</b>

375
00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:35,485
<b>I looked into it, and this company
has a lot of problems.</b>

376
00:31:35,509 --> 00:31:38,110
<b>It's about the clinical trial
they conducted at the sanatorium.</b>

377
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:40,955
<b>They requested to develop
a new drug with rigged data.</b>

378
00:31:40,979 --> 00:31:43,099
<b>And there's a record
that they were investigated by...</b>

379
00:31:47,889 --> 00:31:50,389
<b>What's wrong? Did something happen?</b>

380
00:31:50,919 --> 00:31:51,990
<b>No.</b>

381
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:54,430
<b>Something is up.</b>

382
00:31:55,789 --> 00:31:57,129
<b>What about Ms. Song?</b>

383
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:59,006
<b>No. Not yet.</b>

384
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:00,400
<b>I see. Okay.</b>

385
00:32:11,479 --> 00:32:12,556
<b>Just because she's alive now,</b>

386
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:15,379
<b>does it mean she'll last
one more month or year?</b>

387
00:32:15,409 --> 00:32:18,449
<b>Before she dies, do you think
someone will develop the cure?</b>

388
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:21,849
<b>There are 13 days left
until the reset.</b>

389
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:23,960
<b>This time, you'll decide.</b>

390
00:32:27,889 --> 00:32:29,789
<b>You made the right decision.</b>

391
00:32:30,229 --> 00:32:31,830
<b>I knew you'd make
the right decision.</b>

392
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:34,169
<b>But under one condition.</b>

393
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:40,539
<b>Please keep Detective Park Sun Ho
out of this.</b>

394
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:42,840
<b>He's too dangerous.</b>

395
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:44,580
<b>Of course.</b>

396
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:48,550
<b>I wasn't going to go through
the reset with him, to begin with.</b>

397
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:51,319
<b>I was just playing along...</b>

398
00:32:51,649 --> 00:32:53,990
<b>until Detective Ji was eliminated.</b>

399
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:56,620
<b>Right about now, he's probably...</b>

400
00:32:57,189 --> 00:33:00,759
<b>preparing to take
his role diligently.</b>

401
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,540
<b>Arrest warrant?</b>

402
00:33:14,170 --> 00:33:15,509
<b>On what grounds?</b>

403
00:33:15,839 --> 00:33:17,685
<b>On the grounds of attempted
murder and instigation to murder.</b>

404
00:33:17,709 --> 00:33:20,240
<b>Song Ji Hyun reported it
to Seoul Makang Police Station.</b>

405
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:24,319
<b>I asked you
to be a bit more patient.</b>

406
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,949
<b>I thought you'd be happy
with my decision.</b>

407
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:30,696
<b>Isn't that why you told me
the truth about Professor Hwang?</b>

408
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:31,920
<b>Back then...</b>

409
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:37,060
<b>Things have changed now.</b>

410
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,230
<b>The same goes for me.</b>

411
00:33:39,730 --> 00:33:42,600
<b>I no longer have a reason
to obey his orders.</b>

412
00:33:45,639 --> 00:33:48,069
<b>An arrest warrant for Hwang No Sub
has been issued.</b>

413
00:33:49,009 --> 00:33:50,170
<b>That's a relief.</b>

414
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,310
<b>We can detain him
for at least 48 hours.</b>

415
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:56,149
<b>We'll catch him before the reset
and stop it.</b>

416
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:59,319
<b>We'd be able to put an end to this
if Park Sun Ho is with him.</b>

417
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:04,620
<b>Professor Hwang said that
Mujin was his hometown.</b>

418
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,836
<b>The resetting place
was about two hours from Seoul.</b>

419
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:09,930
<b>Mujin is about that far as well.</b>

420
00:34:10,329 --> 00:34:13,129
<b>Maybe they're hiding there.</b>

421
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,946
<b>Sa Kyung, did you receive
any reports about Park Sun Ho...</b>

422
00:34:21,970 --> 00:34:23,639
<b>being spotted in Mujin?</b>

423
00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:25,139
<b>Hold on.</b>

424
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:29,480
<b>Yes, there was one.</b>

425
00:34:29,910 --> 00:34:32,656
<b>But the CCTV footage was too poor...</b>

426
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:34,196
<b>to verify it.</b>

427
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:35,519
<b>And one more thing.</b>

428
00:34:35,689 --> 00:34:38,019
<b>Can you check if Hwang No Sub
lived in Mujin?</b>

429
00:34:38,519 --> 00:34:40,420
<b>- Text me.
- Okay.</b>

430
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:44,660
<b>I should go right now.</b>

431
00:34:44,899 --> 00:34:46,000
<b>Right now?</b>

432
00:34:46,759 --> 00:34:50,300
<b>We need to catch Park Sun Ho
before tomorrow comes.</b>

433
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:53,675
<b>I'll tell Sa Kyung to come here
just in case.</b>

434
00:34:53,699 --> 00:34:55,139
<b>Don't go anywhere and stay at home.</b>

435
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:56,769
<b>Hyeong Ju.</b>

436
00:35:11,389 --> 00:35:12,959
<b>About Detective Ji...</b>

437
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:17,959
<b>Aren't you curious
about how he'll die?</b>

438
00:35:24,139 --> 00:35:26,740
<b>He dies while trying to save you.</b>

439
00:35:28,769 --> 00:35:31,740
<b>And it's extremely gruesome.</b>

440
00:35:32,009 --> 00:35:34,180
<b>Will Hyeong Ju die because of me?</b>

441
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:36,079
<b>Is this true?</b>

442
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:38,079
<b>Will he die while trying to save me?</b>

443
00:35:46,089 --> 00:35:47,259
<b>Where?</b>

444
00:35:48,389 --> 00:35:49,990
<b>You must know.</b>

445
00:35:50,730 --> 00:35:52,160
<b>Tell me.</b>

446
00:35:52,529 --> 00:35:54,329
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

447
00:35:56,269 --> 00:35:58,399
<b>You and Detective Ji
are going to do everything...</b>

448
00:35:59,470 --> 00:36:01,610
<b>in your power to stop
Professor Hwang.</b>

449
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:05,680
<b>But you see, I need him.</b>

450
00:36:08,879 --> 00:36:11,850
<b>Are you saying you'll go through
the reset once again?</b>

451
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,990
<b>I've thought about it,
and that's the right thing to do.</b>

452
00:36:15,949 --> 00:36:17,389
<b>Once January 11th passes,</b>

453
00:36:18,189 --> 00:36:20,930
<b>I won't be able to bring Young
back to life anymore.</b>

454
00:36:23,829 --> 00:36:25,329
<b>I decided to choose the safe path...</b>

455
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:28,500
<b>over the unseen future.</b>

456
00:36:30,170 --> 00:36:32,800
<b>How do you know
if that future will happen...</b>

457
00:36:33,439 --> 00:36:36,240
<b>in a year or a decade?</b>

458
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:41,850
<b>You could be stopping her...</b>

459
00:36:42,879 --> 00:36:44,480
<b>from turning 10 or even 20.</b>

460
00:36:45,949 --> 00:36:47,319
<b>The fate of death...</b>

461
00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:51,720
<b>can never be changed.</b>

462
00:36:52,889 --> 00:36:53,990
<b>You're wrong.</b>

463
00:36:55,459 --> 00:36:56,930
<b>It can be.</b>

464
00:36:57,430 --> 00:36:58,759
<b>I'll show you.</b>

465
00:37:00,829 --> 00:37:02,700
<b>If he dies while trying to save me,</b>

466
00:37:03,299 --> 00:37:05,269

<b>I know I can't earn
your forgiveness.</b>

624
00:53:34,059 --> 00:53:35,559
<b>But I will remember...</b>

625
00:53:36,130 --> 00:53:37,930
<b>all of my wrongdoings...</b>

626
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:40,299
<b>and plan to accept
and face all of my punishment.</b>

627
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:42,829
<b>I must go back.</b>

628
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:45,539
<b>Another set of painful memories...</b>

629
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:48,099
<b>might be waiting for you there.</b>

630

<b>You may repeat the mistakes
I have made too.</b>

631
00:53:54,180 --> 00:53:55,410
<b>I don't care.</b>

632
00:53:56,009 --> 00:53:57,210
<b>What do I need to do?</b>

633
00:53:57,809 --> 00:53:59,480
<b>As you already guessed,</b>

634
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:02,019
<b>only the professor knows the way.</b>

635
00:54:04,549 --> 00:54:06,319
<b>Are you sure there's no other way?</b>

636
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:18,839
<b>I only know the way
up to the tunnel.</b>

637
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:48,760
<b>He told me that there's
a forked road...</b>

638
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:51,170
<b>at the end of the tunnel.</b>

639
00:55:13,789 --> 00:55:15,089
<b>One way leads to the reset.</b>

640
00:55:16,490 --> 00:55:17,789
<b>And the other way...</b>

641
00:55:18,630 --> 00:55:20,230
<b>leads to death.</b>

642
00:55:22,329 --> 00:55:24,069
<b>Good luck, Detective Ji.</b>

643
00:55:28,839 --> 00:55:32,640
<b>Our fate today will affect
our fate tomorrow.</b>

644
00:56:01,740 --> 00:56:03,260
<b>I don't think
I have a friend like you.</b>

645

<b>A friend who's willing to travel
back in time to save me.</b>

646
00:56:08,380 --> 00:56:10,780
<b>I can at least make one friend
who would before I die, right?</b>

647
00:56:12,420 --> 00:56:15,319
<b>You have me. I'm on my way.</b>

648

<b>- Are you leaving now?
- Yes.</b>

649

<b>- Are you sure you can go alone?
- Of course.</b>

650
00:57:36,829 --> 00:57:38,099
<b>How did you...</b>

651
00:58:00,259 --> 00:58:02,819
<b>It didn't matter which road I took.
They both gave me a chance...</b>

652

<b>Mr. Hwang No Sub.</b>

<b>no matter how hard you try.</b>

661
00:58:28,950 --> 00:58:32,519
<b>It means
you won't be able to do the reset.</b>

662
00:58:36,289 --> 00:58:37,430
<b>You will never...</b>
