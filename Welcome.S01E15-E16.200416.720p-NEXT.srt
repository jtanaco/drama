2
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:15,925
<b>Hong Jo, it was you, wasn't it?</b>

3
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,630
<b>I told you...</b>

4
00:00:18,635 --> 00:00:20,835
<b>that I wanted...</b>

5
00:00:21,405 --> 00:00:24,600
<b>to get more intimate with Bang Guk Bong.</b>

6
00:00:24,608 --> 00:00:26,165
<b>But the thing is,</b>

7
00:00:26,543 --> 00:00:29,035
<b>Bang Guk Bong actually...</b>

8
00:00:29,346 --> 00:00:31,945
<b>kissed me...</b>

9
00:00:32,315 --> 00:00:33,975
<b>all of a sudden.</b>

10
00:00:39,056 --> 00:00:41,685
<b>What am I going to do now?</b>

11
00:00:42,926 --> 00:00:45,585
<b>It was you, wasn't it? You told him, didn't you?</b>

12
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:49,055
<b>What are we going to do?</b>

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,725
<b>Gosh, I'm in so much trouble.</b>

14
00:00:57,207 --> 00:01:01,205
<b>Do you know what's even worse?</b>

15
00:01:02,913 --> 00:01:05,345
<b>I want to...</b>

16
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:07,475
<b>I want to do it again.</b>

17
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:39,445
<b>I should tell her.</b>

18
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:42,515
<b>Wait. Am I being jealous right now?</b>

19
00:01:45,655 --> 00:01:47,555
<b>It's for Sol Ah.</b>

20
00:01:49,659 --> 00:01:51,220
<b>I'm pathetic.</b>

21
00:01:51,228 --> 00:01:52,825
<b>I can't believe I'm jealous.</b>

22
00:01:54,998 --> 00:01:56,625
<b>But I still need to tell her.</b>

23
00:01:59,936 --> 00:02:01,735
<b>Why are you coming out?</b>

24
00:02:02,639 --> 00:02:05,805
<b>It's a bit early to come unannounced like this.</b>

25
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:09,940
<b>Sol Ah and I are close enough to do that.</b>

26
00:02:09,946 --> 00:02:11,540
<b>But you can't just wake her up...</b>

27
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:13,645
<b>I've done that a lot of times.</b>

28
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:16,380
<b>We used to eat sweet red bean porridge and go to school together.</b>

29
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:18,345
<b>Sol Ah doesn't like porridge.</b>

30
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:20,150
<b>She apparently doesn't like the texture.</b>

31
00:02:20,157 --> 00:02:21,650
<b>She eats sweet red bean porridge.</b>

32
00:02:21,658 --> 00:02:23,825
<b>She likes the small rice cakes that are inside them.</b>

33
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,420
<b>Not anymore.</b>

34
00:02:25,428 --> 00:02:26,790
<b>She once got sick because of those small rice cakes.</b>

35
00:02:26,796 --> 00:02:28,425
<b>Oh, right.</b>

36
00:02:28,498 --> 00:02:31,460
<b>Sol Ah tends to get an upset stomach when she eats rice cakes.</b>

37
00:02:31,468 --> 00:02:34,995
<b>She was fine after she ate the tteokbokki I got for her.</b>

38
00:02:35,438 --> 00:02:37,540
<b>I bet you don't know where her favorite park is...</b>

39
00:02:37,541 --> 00:02:39,405
<b>and what her favorite bench is.</b>

40
00:02:40,043 --> 00:02:41,470
<b>I bet you don't know her sleeping habits.</b>

41
00:02:41,478 --> 00:02:43,905
<b>Do you know which side she sleeps on?</b>

42
00:02:46,449 --> 00:02:48,015
<b>Her left side?</b>

43
00:02:48,852 --> 00:02:52,015
<b>She lies on her back.</b>

44
00:02:52,289 --> 00:02:53,915
<b>You can come back later.</b>

45
00:02:54,925 --> 00:02:56,655
<b>What's the use of knowing all that?</b>

46
00:02:57,027 --> 00:02:59,555
<b>Sol Ah doesn't know who you are.</b>

47
00:03:02,799 --> 00:03:04,565
<b>You just hide...</b>

48
00:03:04,668 --> 00:03:06,430
<b>and watch her from behind.</b>

49
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:09,235
<b>So you can't exactly say you really know her.</b>

50
00:03:11,741 --> 00:03:13,365
<b>What's going on?</b>

51
00:03:13,743 --> 00:03:15,335
<b>Sol Ah.</b>

52
00:03:16,146 --> 00:03:17,705
<b>Do you really...</b>

53
00:03:23,053 --> 00:03:24,950
<b>Do you really sleep with Hong Jo?</b>

54
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:28,850
<b>He always snuggles underneath the sheets.</b>

55
00:03:28,858 --> 00:03:31,020
<b>You have no idea how much he moves around at night.</b>

56
00:03:31,027 --> 00:03:32,625
<b>But why do you ask?</b>

57
00:03:34,698 --> 00:03:36,255
<b>It's nothing.</b>

58
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:39,125
<b>I was wondering when you're going to neuter him.</b>

59
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:41,295
<b>I'm not sure.</b>

60
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:43,935
<b>He does need to get neutered.</b>

61
00:03:44,341 --> 00:03:45,965
<b>But...</b>

62
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:47,510
<b>did you come here to ask me that?</b>

63
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:50,240
<b>Yes, there's an animal hospital nearby...</b>

64
00:03:50,247 --> 00:03:51,440
<b>Let's go inside.</b>

65
00:03:51,448 --> 00:03:53,275
<b>- Get lost! - You should do it right away.</b>

66
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:54,650
<b>Hey, calm down.</b>

67
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:56,275
<b>Let's go.</b>

72
00:04:27,317 --> 00:04:29,475
<b>Sol Ah, eat breakfast before you go.</b>

73
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,315
<b>I also made coffee.</b>

74
00:04:48,104 --> 00:04:49,795
<b>No, it's okay.</b>

75
00:04:55,111 --> 00:04:57,345
<b>- Don't you feel well? - I'm fine.</b>

76
00:04:58,648 --> 00:04:59,640
<b>Then what is it?</b>

77
00:04:59,649 --> 00:05:01,245
<b>Why do you keep...</b>

78
00:05:01,651 --> 00:05:03,750
<b>Why won't you look at me?</b>

79
00:05:03,753 --> 00:05:06,345
<b>I'm too embarrassed to look at you.</b>

80
00:05:06,956 --> 00:05:08,450
<b>I mean...</b>

81
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:10,490
<b>Forget about what other people might think.</b>

82
00:05:10,493 --> 00:05:12,860
<b>But we still need to think about our parents.</b>

83
00:05:12,862 --> 00:05:15,495
<b>They only just started living together.</b>

84
00:05:18,468 --> 00:05:20,095
<b>Listen to what I have to say.</b>

85
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:24,470
<b>- I should go. - Wait.</b>

86
00:05:24,474 --> 00:05:26,140
<b>I need to tell you something. It's important.</b>

87
00:05:26,142 --> 00:05:28,035
<b>I'm... I'm late!</b>

88
00:05:28,144 --> 00:05:31,005
<b>Then I'll wait for you. Let's talk once you're done.</b>

89
00:05:34,718 --> 00:05:36,545
<b>I'm going to tell her...</b>

90
00:05:36,686 --> 00:05:38,285
<b>who I really am.</b>

91
00:05:40,824 --> 00:05:43,115
<b>I want to show her my true identity.</b>

92
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,585
<b>Will that be okay?</b>

93
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:52,095
<b>That way, we'll truly be able to like each other.</b>

94
00:06:12,088 --> 00:06:15,255
<b>No way. Is it really you?</b>

95
00:06:17,827 --> 00:06:19,885
<b>A long time ago,</b>

96
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:22,825
<b>I also fell in love just like you.</b>

97
00:06:24,567 --> 00:06:26,365
<b>That's him.</b>

<b>Baek Gu.</b>

99
00:06:53,696 --> 00:06:55,890
<b>I liked this song too.</b>

100
00:06:55,899 --> 00:06:57,795
<b>I see.</b>

101
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:00,395
<b>Thank you.</b>

102
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,845
<b>What happened?</b>

103
00:07:11,948 --> 00:07:14,915
<b>I grew old first.</b>

104
00:07:15,618 --> 00:07:19,380
<b>At one time, we loved each other so much that...</b>

105
00:07:19,389 --> 00:07:22,715
<b>we only had eyes for each other.</b>

106
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:26,755
<b>Now I have grown old and wrinkly,</b>

107
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:29,295
<b>and he doesn't even recognize me.</b>

108
00:07:30,967 --> 00:07:31,960
<b>What?</b>

109
00:07:31,968 --> 00:07:36,795
<b>A cat's time goes by much quicker than a human's.</b>

110
00:07:38,741 --> 00:07:40,775
<b>What do you mean?</b>

111
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:45,640
<b>You will grow old first.</b>

112
00:07:45,648 --> 00:07:49,575
<b>And in the end, you will die first.</b>

113
00:07:50,854 --> 00:07:54,085
<b>Leaving that person alone.</b>

114
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:57,355
<b>Sol Ah...</b>

115
00:07:58,027 --> 00:07:59,760
<b>will be left alone?</b>

116
00:07:59,762 --> 00:08:03,290
<b>So don't let her find out what you really are.</b>

117
00:08:03,299 --> 00:08:05,700
<b>Just stay by her side...</b>

118
00:08:05,702 --> 00:08:08,435
<b>as a silent, wordless cat.</b>

119
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:10,495
<b>If you want to...</b>

120
00:08:10,874 --> 00:08:13,740
<b>at least stay close to your loved one like me,</b>

121
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:16,875
<b>you must never tell her, okay?</b>

122
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:18,880
<b>A cat's time is fleeting.</b>

123
00:08:18,882 --> 00:08:21,975
<b>Love, even more so.</b>

124
00:08:43,206 --> 00:08:44,835
<b>Isn't it nice?</b>

125
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:47,165
<b>Sing it.</b>

126
00:08:48,177 --> 00:08:50,205
<b>- I like this part. - Me too.</b>

127
00:08:51,648 --> 00:08:52,910
<b>- What? - Tada.</b>

128
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:54,515
<b>What's this?</b>

129
00:09:36,459 --> 00:09:39,655
<b>A cat that can't do anything without Sol Ah.</b>

130
00:09:40,263 --> 00:09:42,695
<b>I feel helpless about that fact already.</b>

131
00:09:45,902 --> 00:09:47,495
<b>But there's one more.</b>

132
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:51,065
<b>A cat's most dreadful limit.</b>

133
00:09:52,809 --> 00:09:56,635
<b>Our lives are shorter than a human's.</b>

134
00:10:00,149 --> 00:10:01,775
<b>What should I do?</b>

135
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:05,145
<b>I wanted to tell Sol Ah everything.</b>

136
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:11,125
<b>Don't tell her.</b>

137
00:10:12,729 --> 00:10:14,395
<b>Don't say anything...</b>

138
00:10:15,498 --> 00:10:17,095
<b>and leave.</b>

139
00:10:18,668 --> 00:10:19,900
<b>Leave?</b>

140
00:10:19,902 --> 00:10:22,095
<b>You will die first anyway,</b>

141
00:10:22,138 --> 00:10:24,165
<b>and Sol Ah will be left alone.</b>

142
00:10:24,407 --> 00:10:26,435
<b>The end has been decided.</b>

143
00:10:29,479 --> 00:10:31,405
<b>I know how it feels...</b>

144
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:34,545
<b>to be left alone.</b>

145
00:10:35,084 --> 00:10:37,075
<b>It feels like you're sinking...</b>

146
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:40,015
<b>into a bottomless pool.</b>

147
00:10:43,993 --> 00:10:46,055
<b>Do you want Sol Ah to feel that?</b>

148
00:10:46,596 --> 00:10:48,555
<b>Is leaving her now...</b>

149
00:10:49,866 --> 00:10:52,295
<b>the best I can do for her?</b>

150
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,965
<b>You won't want her to see you...</b>

151
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:02,305
<b>grow old.</b>

152
00:11:04,614 --> 00:11:06,845
<b>It'll be a burden to her.</b>

153
00:11:07,717 --> 00:11:09,645
<b>Is this how it's meant to be?</b>

154
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,645
<b>I'll be leaving her without a word too.</b>

155
00:11:14,957 --> 00:11:16,755
<b>Just like you did.</b>

156
00:11:30,239 --> 00:11:31,805
<b>Not again.</b>

157
00:11:33,076 --> 00:11:34,635
<b>Welcome home.</b>

158
00:11:34,977 --> 00:11:37,375
<b>Why are you up there?</b>

159
00:11:38,548 --> 00:11:39,980
<b>Will you come up?</b>

160
00:11:39,982 --> 00:11:43,315
<b>You said you wanted to talk. Shall we talk up there?</b>

161
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:47,785
<b>That place is a bit...</b>

162
00:11:48,391 --> 00:11:50,555
<b>It's a bit weird.</b>

163
00:11:53,329 --> 00:11:55,895
<b>Okay. Give me a few minutes.</b>

164
00:12:02,438 --> 00:12:03,995
<b>I guess...</b>

165
00:12:04,941 --> 00:12:07,565
<b>it's nice and quiet, perfect for a chat.</b>

166
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:12,405
<b>Shall we sit?</b>

167
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:26,125
<b>My gosh!</b>

168
00:12:27,029 --> 00:12:29,030
<b>Why is your heart beating so fast?</b>

169
00:12:29,031 --> 00:12:30,595
<b>Is it?</b>

170
00:12:35,471 --> 00:12:37,665
<b>Does my time go faster...</b>

171
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:40,865
<b>because my heart beats faster?</b>

172
00:12:41,077 --> 00:12:42,670
<b>What do you mean?</b>

173
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:44,845
<b>Did you drink too much coffee?</b>

174
00:12:46,549 --> 00:12:50,015
<b>Does your heart beat slower than mine?</b>

175
00:12:50,319 --> 00:12:51,915
<b>What?</b>

176
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:55,655
<b>What are you doing?</b>

177
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:57,955
<b>Forget it.</b>

178
00:12:58,661 --> 00:13:01,695
<b>Is this why you wanted me to join you up here?</b>

179
00:13:02,231 --> 00:13:04,465
<b>Just tell me what you wanted to say.</b>

180
00:13:20,383 --> 00:13:22,015
<b>What did you...</b>

181
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:24,485
<b>want to say?</b>

182
00:13:30,927 --> 00:13:32,555
<b>Just one more day.</b>

183
00:13:32,862 --> 00:13:34,425
<b>What?</b>

184
00:13:38,301 --> 00:13:40,295
<b>Let's stay together just one more day.</b>

185
00:13:41,337 --> 00:13:42,995
<b>That means...</b>

186
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:45,535
<b>I'll stay only until today.</b>

187
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:52,745
<b>What about after today?</b>

188
00:13:55,818 --> 00:13:57,945
<b>What happens tomorrow?</b>

189
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,325
<b>I have to go on a trip.</b>

190
00:14:08,531 --> 00:14:10,095
<b>Where to?</b>

191
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:12,865
<b>Bolivia.</b>

192
00:14:13,903 --> 00:14:15,565
<b>The Uyuni salt flats.</b>

193
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:19,105
<b>Really?</b>

194
00:14:23,646 --> 00:14:25,245
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

195
00:14:31,587 --> 00:14:33,515
<b>It's for real.</b>

196
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:37,715
<b>You're leaving.</b>

197
00:14:40,529 --> 00:14:42,695
<b>The Uyuni salt flats.</b>

198
00:14:45,368 --> 00:14:47,565
<b>Why does it have to be there?</b>

199
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:51,235
<b>Because it's furthest away from me?</b>

200
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:04,145
<b>How did we end up being family?</b>

201
00:15:05,454 --> 00:15:07,015
<b>Yes.</b>

202
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:09,455
<b>Family does come first.</b>

203
00:15:10,426 --> 00:15:12,025
<b>But...</b>

204
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:15,025
<b>do you have to go halfway around the world?</b>

205
00:15:15,898 --> 00:15:17,925
<b>And do you have to leave tomorrow?</b>

206
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:21,935
<b>That's why...</b>

207
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:25,805
<b>I want to be with you...</b>

208
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:28,105
<b>today.</b>

209
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,315
<b>Okay.</b>

210
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:43,615
<b>Today is almost over though.</b>

211
00:15:52,468 --> 00:15:55,335
<b>We aren't that high up,</b>

212
00:15:55,972 --> 00:15:58,265
<b>but I see things I couldn't before.</b>

213
00:16:00,609 --> 00:16:03,405
<b>So this is what Hong Jo saw.</b>

214
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:25,295
<b>What are you drawing?</b>

215
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:32,165
<b>Today.</b>

216
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:02,495
<b>What are you looking at?</b>

217
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,805
<b>The cat...</b>

218
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:08,875
<b>Is it me?</b>

219
00:17:09,145 --> 00:17:10,935
<b>Who says it's you?</b>

220
00:17:11,514 --> 00:17:13,405
<b>It's my muse, Hong Jo.</b>

221
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:15,750
<b>What happens after this?</b>

222
00:17:15,751 --> 00:17:17,445
<b>Why didn't you keep drawing?</b>

223
00:17:19,088 --> 00:17:20,950
<b>I don't know.</b>

224
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:23,055
<b>I'm suddenly out of ideas.</b>

225
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,025
<b>But...</b>

226
00:17:26,695 --> 00:17:28,995
<b>I'm never going to draw the two of them kissing.</b>

227
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:31,860
<b>A kiss was powerful enough to bring Snow White back to life...</b>

228
00:17:31,867 --> 00:17:34,865
<b>and turn a frog into a prince. But whenever I kiss,</b>

229
00:17:35,337 --> 00:17:37,565
<b>I suddenly become all alone.</b>

230
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:40,435
<b>It's funny, isn't it?</b>

231
00:17:49,118 --> 00:17:50,845
<b>You're going to...</b>

232
00:17:54,757 --> 00:17:56,615
<b>continue drawing, right?</b>

233
00:17:58,828 --> 00:18:01,055
<b>I'm going to miss it.</b>

234
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,695
<b>I'm going to miss you too.</b>

235
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,735
<b>Goodbye.</b>

236
00:18:57,953 --> 00:18:59,545
<b>Would you like a drink?</b>

237
00:19:01,657 --> 00:19:03,215
<b>Thanks.</b>

238
00:19:07,129 --> 00:19:09,195
<b>I told her I'm going to leave.</b>

239
00:19:11,934 --> 00:19:14,695
<b>I thought I'd be able to be with her forever...</b>

240
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:17,665
<b>as long as I drank coffee.</b>

241
00:19:20,309 --> 00:19:22,135
<b>If you drink coffee to stay awake,</b>

242
00:19:22,278 --> 00:19:24,435
<b>you eventually become really exhausted.</b>

243
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:30,075
<b>Drinking caffeine...</b>

244
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:33,215
<b>is like borrowing time from your future.</b>

245
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:37,385
<b>Do you get it?</b>

246
00:19:37,826 --> 00:19:41,825
<b>The more time I borrow now, the less future I'll have later on.</b>

247
00:19:43,933 --> 00:19:46,125
<b>Living without Sol Ah...</b>

248
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:48,735
<b>will be meaningless anyway.</b>

249
00:19:51,307 --> 00:19:54,065
<b>What if I stay here...</b>

250
00:19:56,645 --> 00:19:58,875
<b>for a bit longer?</b>

251
00:20:20,336 --> 00:20:22,295
<b>Do you want some more coffee?</b>

252
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:26,765
<b>Why don't we go out and get something to eat?</b>

253
00:20:30,846 --> 00:20:32,805
<b>- Sol Ah. - Yes?</b>

254
00:20:33,849 --> 00:20:37,075
<b>You'll tire yourself out if you keep overworking like this.</b>

255
00:20:37,253 --> 00:20:39,085
<b>Let's just call it a day.</b>

256
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:42,250
<b>You guys can go home without me.</b>

257
00:20:42,258 --> 00:20:44,215
<b>Will you be okay by yourself?</b>

258
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:47,085
<b>There are two possible reasons why she's acting like this.</b>

259
00:20:47,096 --> 00:20:49,725
<b>She either really enjoys her work or she doesn't want to go home.</b>

260
00:20:49,798 --> 00:20:52,660
<b>Whenever we got our report card, you stayed in the art room...</b>

261
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:54,395
<b>and drew until really late.</b>

262
00:21:09,418 --> 00:21:11,015
<b>Good luck.</b>

263
00:21:14,857 --> 00:21:17,390
<b>Why is she so obsessed with work?</b>

264
00:21:17,393 --> 00:21:19,625
<b>I personally think it's boring.</b>

265
00:21:20,296 --> 00:21:23,190
<b>And who named the company "Nalsaem"?</b>

266
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:25,695
<b>It's no wonder why we always work until late.</b>

267
00:21:26,769 --> 00:21:28,295
<b>Don't you agree?</b>

268
00:21:28,437 --> 00:21:30,435
<b>Can you at least respond?</b>

269
00:21:33,842 --> 00:21:36,070
<b>"To stay up all night" isn't the only meaning "Nalsaem" has.</b>

270
00:21:36,078 --> 00:21:39,505
<b>It also means "To soar up into the sky".</b>

271
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:40,740
<b>That's what our company's name means.</b>

272
00:21:40,749 --> 00:21:43,415
<b>Well, when is that going to happen?</b>

273
00:21:43,452 --> 00:21:46,080
<b>Every day is the same. It's so repetitive.</b>

274
00:21:46,088 --> 00:21:48,215
<b>That's what I actually like about this company.</b>

275
00:21:50,526 --> 00:21:53,525
<b>I always have something to draw...</b>

276
00:21:53,662 --> 00:21:57,495
<b>every single day.</b>

277
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:00,325
<b>Do you like every drawing you've done at the company?</b>

278
00:22:01,303 --> 00:22:03,770
<b>Don't you want to draw your own drawings?</b>

279
00:22:03,772 --> 00:22:08,475
<b>Well, some people are passionate to do something big.</b>

280
00:22:08,777 --> 00:22:12,475
<b>But some people prefer to do things...</b>

281
00:22:12,648 --> 00:22:16,515
<b>little by little every single day.</b>

282
00:22:16,618 --> 00:22:18,150
<b>I'm more like the latter.</b>

283
00:22:18,153 --> 00:22:20,045
<b>You speak very eloquently.</b>

284
00:22:20,356 --> 00:22:22,655
<b>You make me feel embarrassed for complaining.</b>

285
00:22:26,528 --> 00:22:28,355
<b>Can you walk faster?</b>

286
00:22:29,031 --> 00:22:32,760
<b>I know you find me uncomfortable, so I'll just stay behind you.</b>

287
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:34,995
<b>That makes me feel even more uncomfortable.</b>

288
00:22:35,237 --> 00:22:37,435
<b>I prefer it here.</b>

289
00:22:43,145 --> 00:22:45,245
<b>Since I got you talking, why don't you talk a bit more?</b>

290
00:22:45,647 --> 00:22:47,805
<b>What's your relationship with Ms. Park?</b>

291
00:22:50,052 --> 00:22:53,145
<b>Does she have something on you or something?</b>

292
00:23:04,533 --> 00:23:06,895
<b>He's probably gone by now.</b>

293
00:23:13,509 --> 00:23:17,435
<b>(Uyuni Salt Flat)</b>

294
00:23:49,578 --> 00:23:50,970
<b>What are you doing?</b>

295
00:23:50,979 --> 00:23:52,945
<b>Sol Ah isn't home yet.</b>

296
00:23:53,148 --> 00:23:54,945
<b>I'm worried if she's okay.</b>

297
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:58,715
<b>Wait inside. I'll call her.</b>

298
00:24:12,668 --> 00:24:14,625
<b>What are you doing here?</b>

299
00:24:15,237 --> 00:24:18,405
<b>I was worried you might not come home.</b>

300
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:21,635
<b>I had a lot of work to do.</b>

301
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:25,045
<b>Are you sure it's not because you're scared the house might be empty?</b>

302
00:24:28,484 --> 00:24:30,245
<b>I also heard...</b>

303
00:24:30,519 --> 00:24:32,485
<b>that he's leaving.</b>

304
00:24:34,156 --> 00:24:37,215
<b>I bet he wouldn't feel comfortable about leaving either.</b>

305
00:24:38,494 --> 00:24:40,385
<b>This is awkward.</b>

306
00:24:40,629 --> 00:24:42,390
<b>I can't believe I'm talking about this with you.</b>

307
00:24:42,397 --> 00:24:44,960
<b>What's awkward is the relationship you have with him.</b>

308
00:24:44,967 --> 00:24:47,125
<b>You guys will only end up hurting each other.</b>

309
00:24:47,936 --> 00:24:49,595
<b>I know.</b>

310
00:24:52,207 --> 00:24:54,535
<b>So go home and let him leave in peace.</b>

311
00:24:55,043 --> 00:24:57,935
<b>That way, he won't have to leave with any regrets.</b>

312
00:24:59,348 --> 00:25:02,315
<b>What do you mean?</b>

313
00:25:04,253 --> 00:25:06,845
<b>He hasn't left yet?</b>

314
00:25:07,089 --> 00:25:09,815
<b>Don't be so happy about it. Don't forget you're talking to me.</b>

315
00:25:12,027 --> 00:25:13,985
<b>This is really awkward.</b>

316
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:22,665
<b>- See you. - Okay, bye.</b>

317
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:34,305
<b>Guk Bong.</b>

318
00:25:37,252 --> 00:25:38,815
<b>You're home.</b>

319
00:25:38,987 --> 00:25:40,715
<b>What are you doing here?</b>

320
00:25:42,257 --> 00:25:44,555
<b>And why did you drink so much coffee?</b>

321
00:25:45,928 --> 00:25:47,585
<b>I've been waiting for you.</b>

322
00:25:48,196 --> 00:25:50,230
<b>For how long?</b>

323
00:25:50,232 --> 00:25:51,865
<b>I waited all day.</b>

324
00:25:53,936 --> 00:25:55,570
<b>You're freezing.</b>

325
00:25:55,571 --> 00:25:57,295
<b>Let's go. You must be cold.</b>

326

<b>Thanks.</b>

327
00:26:09,952 --> 00:26:11,945
<b>Why are you still here?</b>

328
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:17,415
<b>Because I wanted to see your drawings.</b>

329
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:19,285
<b>The webtoon?</b>

330
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:23,455
<b>You can see it wherever as long as you have the internet.</b>

331
00:26:23,732 --> 00:26:26,330
<b>I can't wait to see what happens next.</b>

332
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:28,995
<b>I want to be the first one to see it.</b>

333
00:26:30,539 --> 00:26:32,340
<b>I guess I have the talent...</b>

334
00:26:32,341 --> 00:26:34,805
<b>of making people wonder what happens next.</b>

335
00:26:35,143 --> 00:26:38,175
<b>Draw your webtoon. I'll leave once I see it.</b>

336
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:41,375
<b>Okay.</b>

337
00:26:43,952 --> 00:26:47,485
<b>But I'm too tired today.</b>

338
00:26:48,123 --> 00:26:49,815
<b>I just came back from work.</b>

339
00:26:51,627 --> 00:26:53,585
<b>Can I get some rest...</b>

340
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:58,725
<b>and just be with you until the day ends?</b>

341
00:27:07,242 --> 00:27:09,575
<b>There's not much time left anyway.</b>

342
00:27:14,916 --> 00:27:16,515
<b>Okay.</b>

343
00:27:18,253 --> 00:27:19,880
<b>Just until today, okay?</b>

346
00:28:33,328 --> 00:28:35,855
<b>I couldn't draw because I had no ideas.</b>

347
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:39,300
<b>So let's stay together just one more day.</b>

348
00:28:39,301 --> 00:28:40,330
<b>What?</b>

349
00:28:40,335 --> 00:28:42,000
<b>I mean,</b>

350
00:28:42,003 --> 00:28:45,400
<b>inspiration doesn't come suddenly.</b>

351

<b>You have to go out and meet people.</b>

352

<b>There must be input for there to be output.</b>

353
00:28:51,713 --> 00:28:55,580
<b>Also, I feel bad for making you wait yesterday.</b>

354
00:28:55,584 --> 00:28:58,750
<b>We only spent a little time together in the morning and evening.</b>

355
00:28:58,754 --> 00:29:01,685
<b>That's not enough to say we were together for a day.</b>

356
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:03,790
<b>What's your point?</b>

357

<b>We sat here before.</b>

<b>How do you know that? Did you see me here before?</b>

412
00:32:26,895 --> 00:32:28,785
<b>I didn't see it.</b>

413

<b>You would, since you lived nearby.</b>

416

<b>I first saw you somewhere around here.</b>

417
00:33:09,437 --> 00:33:12,135
<b>Wasn't it when I fell from the roof?</b>

418
00:33:14,342 --> 00:33:16,635
<b>I was watching you before then.</b>

419
00:33:16,811 --> 00:33:19,580
<b>You've been watching me? Since when?</b>

420
00:33:19,581 --> 00:33:21,205
<b>From the start.</b>

421

<b>How did I look?</b>

422

<b>It was like a dream.</b>

<b>What?</b>

424

<b>In the short moment when I lost track of you,</b>

<b>I kept having that dream.</b>

<b>But then...</b>

<b>it wasn't a dream.</b>

428

<b>It wasn't a dream.</b>

429
00:34:05,894 --> 00:34:09,355
<b>That's called a dog's dream. Because I'm a dog-like person.</b>

<b>This is another today.</b>

<b>If you keep putting it off like this,</b>

<b>Isn't it strange?</b>

439
00:35:15,597 --> 00:35:17,160
<b>I thought tomorrow would come yesterday,</b>

440

<b>but I opened my eyes, and it's today again!</b>

00:38:14,342 --> 00:38:16,005
<b>Why don't we go and talk?</b>

479
00:38:16,778 --> 00:38:18,940
<b>She's talking with me right now.</b>

480
00:38:18,946 --> 00:38:20,545
<b>About what?</b>

481
00:38:20,748 --> 00:38:22,575
<b>She never talks to me.</b>

482
00:38:22,784 --> 00:38:24,480
<b>When she's our project team leader.</b>

483
00:38:24,485 --> 00:38:25,750
<b>You shouldn't keep talking...</b>

484
00:38:25,753 --> 00:38:28,080
<b>to someone who's silently doing her job.</b>

485
00:38:28,089 --> 00:38:29,715
<b>Let's go talk.</b>

486
00:38:32,293 --> 00:38:35,285
<b>She doing something that isn't even part of her job.</b>

487
00:38:35,296 --> 00:38:36,830
<b>I mean,</b>

488
00:38:36,831 --> 00:38:39,430
<b>her boss kept asking for personal favors,</b>

489
00:38:39,434 --> 00:38:42,230
<b>and she kept doing it without saying a word.</b>

490
00:38:42,236 --> 00:38:44,165
<b>She didn't even know how to refuse.</b>

491
00:38:45,039 --> 00:38:47,470
<b>She kept being summoned during working hours,</b>

492
00:38:47,475 --> 00:38:48,840
<b>and couldn't even eat lunch...</b>

493
00:38:48,843 --> 00:38:51,070
<b>because she was busy writing what floor the buffet was at...</b>

494
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:53,875
<b>on a wedding invitation for someone she doesn't even know.</b>

495
00:38:53,915 --> 00:38:55,780
<b>Why can't you say anything?</b>

496
00:38:55,783 --> 00:38:58,110
<b>That's why you're being treated as a pushover.</b>

497
00:38:58,119 --> 00:38:59,380
<b>Because you won't say anything anyway...</b>

498
00:38:59,387 --> 00:39:01,450
<b>even if that boss asks for personal favors.</b>

499
00:39:01,456 --> 00:39:03,050
<b>You keep quiet even when everyone bullies you...</b>

500
00:39:03,057 --> 00:39:04,490
<b>and thinks you don't deserve to work here.</b>

501
00:39:04,492 --> 00:39:05,990
<b>- Mr. Ko. - "No, I can't!"</b>

502
00:39:05,993 --> 00:39:07,655
<b>"I won't!"</b>

503
00:39:14,969 --> 00:39:16,665
<b>Just say it.</b>

504
00:39:26,914 --> 00:39:31,215
<b>I mean, if you said no, she would've asked me to do it.</b>

505
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:34,215
<b>It's been my lifelong dream to design a wedding invitation.</b>

506
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:39,455
<b>I can even sing for free too.</b>

507
00:39:52,073 --> 00:39:54,205
<b>Doo... Doo Sik.</b>

508
00:39:58,012 --> 00:40:01,145
<b>- Stop following me. - Where are you going?</b>

509
00:40:01,482 --> 00:40:02,580
<b>I don't know.</b>

510
00:40:02,583 --> 00:40:04,450
<b>I lost my temper and just realized what I did.</b>

511
00:40:04,452 --> 00:40:06,045
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

512
00:40:07,455 --> 00:40:09,020
<b>You should feel sorry for yourself.</b>

513
00:40:09,023 --> 00:40:10,890
<b>You said you liked drawing so much.</b>

514
00:40:10,892 --> 00:40:12,955
<b>Will you call that your drawing too?</b>

515
00:40:20,268 --> 00:40:22,230
<b>Why do you keep following me from behind?</b>

516
00:40:22,236 --> 00:40:24,895
<b>Do you secretly stare at my butt or something?</b>

517
00:40:26,007 --> 00:40:27,765
<b>I guess you found out.</b>

518
00:40:41,956 --> 00:40:44,315
<b>Do you need another part-timer?</b>

519
00:40:52,433 --> 00:40:54,360
<b>Let me work at your cafe.</b>

520
00:40:54,368 --> 00:40:56,465
<b>Ask for your own cup.</b>

521
00:40:57,572 --> 00:40:59,970
<b>I might get fired.</b>

522
00:40:59,974 --> 00:41:01,800
<b>Even if I want to continue my parents' business,</b>

523
00:41:01,809 --> 00:41:03,405
<b>you took away our part-timer.</b>

524
00:41:03,478 --> 00:41:05,475
<b>Our sales have plummeted since then.</b>

525
00:41:06,347 --> 00:41:09,745
<b>You can take him back. I can't stand the sight of him.</b>

526
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:11,975
<b>Why? What do you mean?</b>

527
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:15,845
<b>Because he's with Sol Ah all the time.</b>

528
00:41:16,524 --> 00:41:17,650
<b>You can't do anything about that.</b>

529
00:41:17,658 --> 00:41:19,690
<b>It's not like they're living together because they want to.</b>

530
00:41:19,694 --> 00:41:21,355
<b>Sol Ah...</b>

531
00:41:22,763 --> 00:41:24,455
<b>only looks at him.</b>

532
00:41:25,867 --> 00:41:28,165
<b>She smiles next to him...</b>

533
00:41:29,504 --> 00:41:31,135
<b>and chats with him...</b>

534
00:41:31,506 --> 00:41:32,870
<b>and even falls asleep with him.</b>

535
00:41:32,874 --> 00:41:35,365
<b>That's because they spend more time since they're living together.</b>

536
00:41:38,846 --> 00:41:42,075
<b>Kim Sol Ah? She finally got over you?</b>

537
00:41:43,518 --> 00:41:45,680
<b>You seem a bit excited.</b>

538
00:41:45,686 --> 00:41:48,080
<b>Hey, honestly, it does feel satisfying.</b>

539
00:41:48,089 --> 00:41:50,515
<b>If I think about how much Sol Ah suffered because of you.</b>

540
00:41:51,626 --> 00:41:55,355
<b>But the guy she chose after you is Bang Guk Bong?</b>

541
00:41:55,363 --> 00:41:57,125
<b>Are you sure? What will you do?</b>

542
00:41:58,332 --> 00:42:00,000
<b>I'll make her stop.</b>

543
00:42:00,001 --> 00:42:03,065
<b>Stop what? How will you do that?</b>

544
00:42:03,137 --> 00:42:06,000
<b>No matter how weird that guy is, Sol Ah chose him.</b>

545
00:42:06,007 --> 00:42:08,805
<b>You don't want her for yourself but don't want to give her up either?</b>

546
00:42:09,143 --> 00:42:10,775
<b>How selfish.</b>

547
00:42:11,345 --> 00:42:13,175
<b>It's not that.</b>

548
00:42:14,282 --> 00:42:16,245
<b>Do you have feelings for Sol Ah?</b>

549
00:42:23,224 --> 00:42:24,785
<b>Hey...</b>

550
00:42:26,227 --> 00:42:29,285
<b>Hey. Is it true?</b>

551
00:42:29,697 --> 00:42:31,355
<b>After all this time?</b>

552
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:35,065
<b>It's not for me, but for Sol Ah's sake.</b>

553
00:42:35,269 --> 00:42:37,165
<b>What are you talking about?</b>

554
00:42:37,338 --> 00:42:40,135
<b>"I will like you for your sake?"</b>

555
00:42:40,241 --> 00:42:42,570
<b>- How pathetic. - I'll become pathetic.</b>

556
00:42:42,577 --> 00:42:46,175
<b>Even if I become pathetic, I'll protect Sol Ah.</b>

557
00:42:48,849 --> 00:42:50,715
<b>In this situation,</b>

558
00:42:51,686 --> 00:42:54,645
<b>I'm the only one who can protect her.</b>

559
00:43:00,928 --> 00:43:03,325
<b>I told you to ask for your own glass.</b>

560
00:43:03,464 --> 00:43:05,160
<b>You ask then.</b>

561
00:43:05,166 --> 00:43:07,100
<b>Why should I when this is my glass?</b>

562
00:43:07,101 --> 00:43:09,965
<b>I want to drink with this glass.</b>

563
00:43:10,071 --> 00:43:11,700
<b>Whatever.</b>

564
00:43:11,706 --> 00:43:13,840
<b>- You can't even drink. - I will protect Sol Ah.</b>

565
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:16,305
<b>- Get that? - Whatever, do what you want.</b>

566
00:43:16,944 --> 00:43:18,675
<b>What's wrong with you?</b>

567
00:43:22,617 --> 00:43:25,115
<b>It's dark. Let's go inside.</b>

568
00:43:25,653 --> 00:43:27,585
<b>You asked me to draw.</b>

569
00:43:28,589 --> 00:43:30,185
<b>Aren't you cold?</b>

570
00:43:30,992 --> 00:43:32,585
<b>I'm okay.</b>

571
00:43:48,409 --> 00:43:51,035
<b>You asked me to draw.</b>

572
00:43:56,183 --> 00:43:57,945
<b>Are you hurt?</b>

573
00:43:57,952 --> 00:43:59,715
<b>- It's nothing. - Let me see.</b>

574
00:44:00,921 --> 00:44:03,120
<b>This scar looks pretty deep.</b>

575
00:44:03,124 --> 00:44:05,455
<b>How did this happen? When?</b>

576
00:44:11,432 --> 00:44:14,395
<b>Come to think of it, Hong Jo hurt his front leg too.</b>

577
00:44:15,169 --> 00:44:16,865
<b>His left leg like you.</b>

578
00:44:24,211 --> 00:44:27,505
<b>There's something that I imagine from time to time.</b>

579
00:44:28,549 --> 00:44:30,745
<b>I know it will sound funny,</b>

580
00:44:33,521 --> 00:44:36,585
<b>but I think you're Hong Jo sometimes.</b>

581
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:40,220
<b>I mean, if I think about it,</b>

582
00:44:40,227 --> 00:44:43,425
<b>I've never seen you holding Hong Jo.</b>

583
00:44:43,564 --> 00:44:45,660
<b>Strangely, every time you're around,</b>

584
00:44:45,666 --> 00:44:48,795
<b>Hong Jo never comes out and is nowhere to be seen.</b>

585
00:44:49,070 --> 00:44:52,395
<b>Right, I thought your eyes seemed strangely similar.</b>

586
00:44:53,174 --> 00:44:55,465
<b>And you even act like a cat.</b>

587
00:45:03,617 --> 00:45:06,845
<b>I always felt lonely liking guys like cats,</b>

588
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:10,515
<b>so I wanted to meet someone who was like a dog.</b>

589
00:45:13,627 --> 00:45:16,295
<b>But I somehow ended up falling for...</b>

590
00:45:20,267 --> 00:45:21,895
<b>a cat-like guy again.</b>

591
00:45:29,009 --> 00:45:30,635
<b>I'm sorry...</b>

592
00:45:31,112 --> 00:45:32,705
<b>for being a cat.</b>

593
00:45:40,321 --> 00:45:41,985
<b>Thank you.</b>

594
00:45:45,459 --> 00:45:47,055
<b>For being a cat.</b>

595
00:45:56,203 --> 00:45:59,395
<b>You said we should spend just today together.</b>

596
00:45:59,707 --> 00:46:02,665
<b>To me, it felt like Hong Jo was saying that.</b>

597
00:46:04,478 --> 00:46:07,275
<b>Think about tomorrow when tomorrow comes.</b>

598
00:46:07,548 --> 00:46:10,075
<b>And just focus on today, today.</b>

599
00:46:11,252 --> 00:46:13,315
<b>Cats are like that.</b>

600
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:17,415
<b>I tried living like a cat,</b>

601
00:46:18,058 --> 00:46:20,885
<b>and every day was a great today.</b>

602
00:46:20,895 --> 00:46:22,585
<b>Me too.</b>

603
00:46:23,798 --> 00:46:26,195
<b>I hoped today would never end.</b>

604
00:46:28,335 --> 00:46:29,895
<b>Then can't we...</b>

605
00:46:31,705 --> 00:46:34,435
<b>just go on living like cats?</b>

606
00:46:40,781 --> 00:46:45,415
<b>Waking up to a brand-new today is so fun and exciting.</b>

607
00:46:47,354 --> 00:46:49,015
<b>Can't we just...</b>

608
00:46:51,892 --> 00:46:53,585
<b>live for...</b>

609
00:46:54,528 --> 00:46:56,255
<b>today?</b>

610
00:47:15,616 --> 00:47:17,345
<b>Kim Sol Ah!</b>

611
00:47:20,054 --> 00:47:21,985
<b>Let's talk.</b>

612
00:47:24,725 --> 00:47:26,855
<b>What's the matter?</b>

613
00:47:27,695 --> 00:47:29,255
<b>Kim Sol Ah.</b>

614
00:47:29,997 --> 00:47:32,625
<b>Why did you come with her?</b>

615
00:47:34,468 --> 00:47:38,535
<b>You shouldn't be here. Why are you still here?</b>

616
00:47:40,574 --> 00:47:42,765
<b>You... You can go.</b>

617
00:47:42,943 --> 00:47:44,610
<b>- Hey, wait. - Get out.</b>

618
00:47:44,612 --> 00:47:45,610
<b>Right now.</b>

619
00:47:45,613 --> 00:47:47,310
<b>Did you have a drink?</b>

620
00:47:47,314 --> 00:47:48,580
<b>Get out of here.</b>

621
00:47:48,582 --> 00:47:50,645
<b>- I'll get some water. - Okay.</b>

622
00:47:51,085 --> 00:47:55,145
<b>Kim Sol Ah. You don't know anything.</b>

623
00:47:56,257 --> 00:47:58,155
<b>That idiot...</b>

624
00:47:58,826 --> 00:48:01,285
<b>can't be with you because...</b>

625
00:48:01,996 --> 00:48:03,725
<b>That idiot...</b>

626
00:48:04,598 --> 00:48:06,395
<b>That idiot...</b>

627
00:48:07,034 --> 00:48:08,695
<b>is a ca...</b>

628
00:48:10,004 --> 00:48:11,630
<b>- A ca... - Who did you drink with?</b>

629
00:48:11,639 --> 00:48:14,035
<b>- Ko Doo Sik? - Ko Doo Sik!</b>

630
00:48:14,575 --> 00:48:17,005
<b>That idiot is Ko Doo Sik.</b>

631
00:48:17,044 --> 00:48:18,540
<b>What?</b>

632
00:48:18,545 --> 00:48:21,080
<b>Why are you calling Bang Guk Bong, Ko Doo Sik?</b>

633
00:48:21,081 --> 00:48:23,875
<b>No. I mean...</b>

634
00:48:24,351 --> 00:48:27,015
<b>That guy isn't Bang Guk Bong.</b>

635
00:48:27,187 --> 00:48:28,745
<b>No.</b>

636
00:48:29,156 --> 00:48:31,115
<b>He's not even human.</b>

637
00:48:31,892 --> 00:48:33,420
<b>You don't have to be so mean.</b>

638
00:48:33,427 --> 00:48:34,720
<b>No, listen to me.</b>

639
00:48:34,728 --> 00:48:37,655
<b>Okay, fine. Give me a moment.</b>

640
00:48:41,435 --> 00:48:43,125
<b>Hello, Ms. Bang.</b>

641
00:48:44,004 --> 00:48:45,400
<b>Yes, I can talk.</b>

642
00:48:45,406 --> 00:48:47,900
<b>Your father's birthday is coming up.</b>

643
00:48:47,908 --> 00:48:50,240
<b>Can you come by this weekend?</b>

644
00:48:50,244 --> 00:48:51,210
<b>What?</b>

645
00:48:51,211 --> 00:48:54,075
<b>I wish Guk Bong could come with you.</b>

646
00:48:55,683 --> 00:48:58,075
<b>With Bang Guk Bong?</b>

647
00:48:58,085 --> 00:49:01,450
<b>The truth is, we got a marriage license.</b>

648
00:49:01,455 --> 00:49:03,050
<b>We won't have a wedding,</b>

649
00:49:03,057 --> 00:49:06,285
<b>but I thought we should eat together as a family.</b>

650
00:49:06,694 --> 00:49:09,490
<b>If you're not up for it, you don't have to come.</b>

651
00:49:09,496 --> 00:49:12,395
<b>No. I should come.</b>

652
00:49:12,833 --> 00:49:15,025
<b>Yes. I'll be there.</b>

653
00:49:16,603 --> 00:49:18,235
<b>Bye.</b>

654
00:49:21,809 --> 00:49:23,240
<b>What was that about?</b>

655
00:49:23,243 --> 00:49:25,505
<b>That sounded like a parent.</b>

656
00:49:26,613 --> 00:49:28,405
<b>Bang Guk Bong's...</b>

657
00:49:28,582 --> 00:49:30,175
<b>mother.</b>

658
00:49:31,051 --> 00:49:32,745
<b>Yes.</b>

659
00:49:33,187 --> 00:49:37,085
<b>She wants us to visit together.</b>

660
00:49:46,734 --> 00:49:48,595
<b>This is it.</b>

661
00:49:49,169 --> 00:49:51,095
<b>Don't go any further.</b>

662
00:49:52,373 --> 00:49:54,165
<b>Stop right here.</b>

663
00:50:00,581 --> 00:50:02,745
<b>Before the truth comes out.</b>

664
00:50:30,844 --> 00:50:32,805
<b>Are you going today?</b>

665
00:50:33,013 --> 00:50:34,605
<b>To your parents?</b>

666
00:50:36,483 --> 00:50:38,575
<b>I bought your ticket too.</b>

667
00:50:40,187 --> 00:50:43,715
<b>I have to drop by work. Let's meet at the train station.</b>

668
00:50:44,992 --> 00:50:46,655
<b>I can't go.</b>

669
00:50:49,763 --> 00:50:52,325
<b>I know how it'll all end.</b>

670
00:50:52,833 --> 00:50:54,565
<b>Because I'm me.</b>

671
00:50:58,105 --> 00:51:00,235
<b>I'll just cause you a heartache.</b>

672
00:51:05,279 --> 00:51:06,905
<b>Bang Guk Bong.</b>

673
00:51:08,682 --> 00:51:10,245
<b>It looks like...</b>

674
00:51:13,087 --> 00:51:15,085
<b>I won't get to see your drawing.</b>

675
00:51:22,463 --> 00:51:24,355
<b>Do you have to leave?</b>

676
00:51:26,166 --> 00:51:29,895
<b>It might not seem so now, but later as time goes by,</b>

677
00:51:31,205 --> 00:51:32,995
<b>it'll only get worse for you.</b>

678
00:51:33,574 --> 00:51:35,135
<b>Who knows?</b>

679
00:51:35,742 --> 00:51:38,205
<b>Giving up now might cause more heartache later.</b>

680
00:51:39,246 --> 00:51:43,005
<b>I might still miss you, feel bad, and have regrets about today...</b>

681
00:51:43,784 --> 00:51:47,245
<b>no matter how much time passes by.</b>

682
00:51:50,958 --> 00:51:53,215
<b>Every day is today,</b>

683
00:51:54,261 --> 00:51:57,055
<b>but a today that has passed never comes back.</b>

684
00:52:06,473 --> 00:52:08,000
<b>Sol Ah.</b>

685
00:52:08,008 --> 00:52:10,470
<b>Didn't you say you're going to your father's?</b>

686
00:52:10,477 --> 00:52:12,705
<b>- I am. - Take care.</b>

687
00:52:12,946 --> 00:52:15,505
<b>Is Bang Guk Bong going too?</b>

688
00:52:16,416 --> 00:52:18,075
<b>I don't know...</b>

689
00:52:18,519 --> 00:52:20,315
<b>if he'll come or not.</b>

690
00:52:24,191 --> 00:52:26,890
<b>I have to leave early today.</b>

691
00:52:26,894 --> 00:52:28,260
<b>- Okay. - Take care.</b>

692
00:52:28,262 --> 00:52:29,690
<b>Bye.</b>

693
00:52:29,696 --> 00:52:31,255
<b>See you.</b>

<b>(KTX platform)</b>

695
00:53:00,194 --> 00:53:01,755
<b>Hi, Sol Ah.</b>

696
00:53:01,962 --> 00:53:03,755
<b>Hey, Jae Seon.</b>

697
00:53:04,198 --> 00:53:05,995
<b>I'm at the train station.</b>

698
00:53:06,366 --> 00:53:09,795
<b>I'm sorry, but can you do me a favor?</b>

699
00:53:09,803 --> 00:53:11,170
<b>Sure.</b>

700
00:53:11,171 --> 00:53:14,965
<b>Hong Jo will be alone at home. Can you check on him?</b>

701
00:53:16,343 --> 00:53:17,935
<b>What about Bang Guk Bong?</b>

702
00:53:18,545 --> 00:53:20,275
<b>I'm going with him.</b>

703
00:53:20,981 --> 00:53:22,705
<b>You're going together?</b>

704
00:53:24,051 --> 00:53:26,475
<b>Or maybe not.</b>

705
00:53:26,787 --> 00:53:28,550
<b>Are you waiting for him?</b>

706
00:53:28,555 --> 00:53:31,255
<b>Anyway, take care of Hong Jo for me.</b>

707
00:53:42,603 --> 00:53:44,265
<b>Bang Guk Bong.</b>

708
00:53:44,605 --> 00:53:46,535
<b>No. Hong Jo.</b>

709
00:53:47,808 --> 00:53:49,435
<b>Are you here?</b>

710
00:54:24,778 --> 00:54:26,435
<b>He left.</b>

711

<b>Kim Sol Ah.</b>

<b>Stop waiting.</b>

714

<b>He left.</b>

715
00:55:21,735 --> 00:55:23,295
<b>I'll be with you.</b>

716
00:55:28,709 --> 00:55:29,840
<b>What?</b>

717
00:55:29,843 --> 00:55:32,605
<b>I put you through too much for too long.</b>

718
00:55:33,613 --> 00:55:36,005
<b>So I don't have the right to do this,</b>

719
00:55:37,584 --> 00:55:40,615
<b>but don't go elsewhere for comfort for what I did to you.</b>

720
00:55:42,723 --> 00:55:43,820
<b>I'll comfort you.</b>

721
00:55:43,824 --> 00:55:46,785
<b>- Jae Seon. - I won't leave you alone again.</b>

722

<b>I'll be there for you.</b>

<b>Bang Guk Bong.</b>

724

<b>- Don't mention a guy that left. - He hasn't left.</b>

725
00:56:36,643 --> 00:56:38,805
<b>I thought about it all night.</b>

726
00:56:40,013 --> 00:56:42,545
<b>The end is too obvious.</b>

727
00:56:44,284 --> 00:56:48,745
<b>Should I go down that obvious path or not?</b>

728
00:56:50,323 --> 00:56:51,985
<b>Did you finish the drawing?</b>

729
00:57:00,567 --> 00:57:02,695
<b>The result may be obvious,</b>

730
00:57:03,904 --> 00:57:07,565
<b>but there might be something for me on that path.</b>

<b>I...</b>

735
00:57:42,209 --> 00:57:43,775
<b>like you.</b>

736

<b>I just don't think it's me to run away and hide.</b>

737
00:57:56,490 --> 00:57:58,385
<b>I must like whoever I like.</b>

738
00:58:00,126 --> 00:58:03,385
<b>Enough to let the whole world know.</b>

739

<b>This is my choice.</b>
