157
00:11:24,117 --> 00:11:26,487
<b>So I told you not to walk around
showing your face to others.</b>

158
00:11:26,546 --> 00:11:28,247
<b>Was that so hard for you
to understand?</b>

159
00:11:29,716 --> 00:11:31,556
<b>- You darn wench.
- I'm sorry.</b>

160
00:11:38,397 --> 00:11:41,367
<b>You're the one
who can't seem to understand things.</b>

161
00:11:42,227 --> 00:11:43,336
<b>What did she just say?</b>

162
00:11:44,936 --> 00:11:47,466
<b>Has she lost her mind?</b>

163
00:11:47,466 --> 00:11:48,767
<b>You crazy wench.</b>

164
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:57,546
<b>Get her!</b>

165
00:12:05,186 --> 00:12:07,127
<b>Let me go, you wench!</b>

166
00:12:16,497 --> 00:12:17,936
<b>Hey!</b>

167
00:13:11,987 --> 00:13:14,157
<b>Kind people
always keep their promises.</b>

168
00:13:14,956 --> 00:13:16,497
<b>And you promised to keep it clean.</b>

169
00:13:17,426 --> 00:13:18,426
<b>Of course.</b>

170
00:13:39,586 --> 00:13:41,487
<b>She beat them all up...</b>

171
00:13:42,586 --> 00:13:43,657
<b>in just one round.</b>

172
00:13:47,527 --> 00:13:49,727
<b>You're really a psycho.</b>

173
00:13:51,857 --> 00:13:54,296
<b>You're the only one who volunteered
to receive solitary confinement...</b>

174
00:13:54,326 --> 00:13:55,926
<b>before getting released on parole.</b>

175
00:13:59,066 --> 00:14:00,066
<b>Are you crying?</b>

176
00:14:04,877 --> 00:14:07,277
<b>Can you give me one more spoon
of red pepper paste?</b>

177
00:14:07,407 --> 00:14:09,176
<b>This tastes amazing today.</b>

178
00:14:09,747 --> 00:14:12,176
<b>Whoever cooked the vegetables
did an excellent job.</b>

179
00:14:12,877 --> 00:14:13,916
<b>My gosh.</b>

180
00:14:24,956 --> 00:14:28,096
<b>Bring Baek Chan Mi back
and make her catch Michael.</b>

181
00:14:28,966 --> 00:14:31,037
<b>Sir, I don't think
it's a good idea...</b>

182
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:32,867
<b>to have her on the case.</b>

183
00:14:32,867 --> 00:14:34,737
<b>The president is keeping an eye
on this case.</b>

184
00:14:34,867 --> 00:14:37,977
<b>Our department might disappear
if we fail to catch him.</b>

185
00:14:38,637 --> 00:14:41,107
<b>Why don't we leave this to Mr. Dong?</b>

186
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:42,676
<b>I'm sure he'll do well.</b>

187
00:14:42,706 --> 00:14:43,877
<b>Mr. Dong, I want you...</b>

188
00:14:44,546 --> 00:14:46,316
<b>to be in charge of this mission.</b>

189
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:49,887
<b>But...</b>

190
00:15:00,227 --> 00:15:01,867
<b>I can't handle Baek Chan Mi.</b>

191
00:15:01,867 --> 00:15:03,596
<b>I don't like her either.</b>

192
00:15:03,936 --> 00:15:05,966
<b>But you heard what he said.
We were given orders.</b>

193
00:15:06,306 --> 00:15:07,966
<b>If you don't want to follow orders,
you can either quit...</b>

194
00:15:08,336 --> 00:15:09,676
<b>or become more competent.</b>

195
00:15:09,706 --> 00:15:11,176
<b>Then I'll just quit.</b>

196
00:15:11,407 --> 00:15:13,306
<b>I heard your monthly pay
got distrained...</b>

197
00:15:13,306 --> 00:15:14,946
<b>because you couldn't even afford
to pay your alimony.</b>

198
00:15:15,346 --> 00:15:17,446
<b>You need a job to make a living.</b>

199
00:15:34,367 --> 00:15:36,537
<b>(Good Casting)</b>

200
00:15:46,007 --> 00:15:47,247
<b>Get back to work.</b>

201
00:15:53,186 --> 00:15:55,287
<b>(Sweet Americano: 70 cents,
Ice: 60 cents)</b>

202
00:15:55,546 --> 00:15:56,987
<b>How many times
do I need to tell you...</b>

203
00:15:57,316 --> 00:16:00,987
<b>that you can't make a claim

204

205
00:16:02,056 --> 00:16:05,897
<b>I drank this while I was
waiting for the summit to end...</b>

206
00:16:05,897 --> 00:16:07,466
<b>last month.</b>

207
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:10,096
<b>- Oh, the summit?
- Yes.</b>

208
00:16:11,367 --> 00:16:12,497
<b>At Hongdae?</b>

209
00:16:13,237 --> 00:16:14,706
<b>At two in the morning?</b>

210
00:16:29,186 --> 00:16:30,387
<b>Don't mess up.</b>

211
00:16:34,127 --> 00:16:35,127
<b>Hello?</b>

212
00:16:35,556 --> 00:16:37,657
<b>Yes, this is Hwang Mi Soon.</b>

213
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:40,666
<b>I think you called the wrong number.</b>

214
00:16:42,696 --> 00:16:45,867
<b>Here you go, sir.
I got you iced tea.</b>

215
00:16:46,196 --> 00:16:48,407
<b>And I got you an iced Americano
since you're always...</b>

216
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:49,737
<b>doing fieldwork.</b>

217
00:16:49,877 --> 00:16:51,206
<b>I should be buying you a drink.</b>

218
00:16:51,977 --> 00:16:54,747
<b>I owe Ye Eun so much.</b>

219
00:16:54,777 --> 00:16:57,017
<b>A field agent is like a motor,</b>

220
00:16:57,017 --> 00:16:59,076
<b>and the support team is like fuel.</b>

221
00:16:59,076 --> 00:17:01,816
<b>Not just any type of fuel.
I'm talking about the best kind.</b>

222
00:17:02,017 --> 00:17:05,086
<b>All I do is help her do her work.</b>

223
00:17:05,086 --> 00:17:08,527
<b>It doesn't matter
how good the motor is.</b>

224
00:17:09,186 --> 00:17:11,326
<b>Once it breaks, it becomes useless.</b>

225
00:17:13,926 --> 00:17:16,596
<b>Ye Eun, don't you want to do
fieldwork sometimes?</b>

226
00:17:16,737 --> 00:17:19,566
<b>Gosh, that kind of work
isn't for everyone.</b>

227
00:17:19,937 --> 00:17:21,667
<b>I prefer working in the office.</b>

228
00:17:21,667 --> 00:17:25,207
<b>My goal is to keep this job
until I retire due to old age.</b>

229
00:17:26,306 --> 00:17:31,546
<b>We're better off staying quiet
until we're too old to work here.</b>

230
00:17:31,747 --> 00:17:33,586
<b>I've seen tons of colleagues
get fired...</b>

231
00:17:33,586 --> 00:17:36,517
<b>because they failed to meet
their performance standards.</b>

232
00:17:39,987 --> 00:17:41,056
<b>Yes, of course.</b>

233
00:17:41,287 --> 00:17:43,296
<b>A white agent in the field?</b>

234
00:17:43,296 --> 00:17:45,197
<b>There are no precedents,
and it's totally absurd.</b>

235
00:17:45,556 --> 00:17:46,566
<b>That's right.</b>

236
00:17:49,066 --> 00:17:50,136
<b>Just a second.</b>

237
00:17:51,096 --> 00:17:53,866
<b>Hello, this is Im Ye Eun
from the support team.</b>

238
00:17:55,566 --> 00:17:56,606
<b>What?</b>

239
00:17:57,306 --> 00:17:58,437
<b>I don't want to do it.</b>

240
00:17:59,977 --> 00:18:02,106
<b>If I do fieldwork at my age,
I might actually die.</b>

241
00:18:02,106 --> 00:18:05,717
<b>I don't even take the stairs
these days because I have arthritis.</b>

242
00:18:06,017 --> 00:18:08,287
<b>Forget it.
I'm really not interested.</b>

243
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:10,316
<b>Gosh, what's the matter with you?</b>

244
00:18:10,586 --> 00:18:14,187
<b>You'd never let arthritis
get in the way of your career.</b>

245
00:18:15,056 --> 00:18:17,427
<b>It's been a while since
we worked together, dear colleague.</b>

246
00:18:17,957 --> 00:18:21,126
<b>Who cares about colleagues and such?
It's been way too long.</b>

247
00:18:21,296 --> 00:18:23,126
<b>I don't care
if you're my colleague or not.</b>

248
00:18:23,126 --> 00:18:24,167
<b>Don't anger me.</b>

249
00:18:24,197 --> 00:18:25,767
<b>And seriously? Her?</b>

250
00:18:26,267 --> 00:18:27,967
<b>You want me to do
fieldwork with her?</b>

251
00:18:28,237 --> 00:18:31,106
<b>I've never worked as a field agent
in my entire life.</b>

252
00:18:31,106 --> 00:18:34,707
<b>See? She's a complete rookie.
What am I supposed to do with her?</b>

253
00:18:34,707 --> 00:18:36,177
<b>I have a kid.</b>

254
00:18:36,376 --> 00:18:39,816
<b>I may look young,
but I have a three-year-old kid.</b>

255
00:18:46,217 --> 00:18:48,586
<b>Early childhood insurance is a must.
Do you have one?</b>

256
00:18:49,156 --> 00:18:52,156
<b>Kids get hurt very easily.</b>

257
00:18:52,156 --> 00:18:54,396
<b>And hospital bills cost a fortune.</b>

258
00:18:55,727 --> 00:18:56,737
<b>Right.</b>

259
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:01,467
<b>I'm sorry, sir.</b>

260
00:19:01,667 --> 00:19:04,277
<b>But can't you just tell them
that I'm not capable of doing...</b>

261
00:19:04,277 --> 00:19:07,606
<b>You're right. It's practically
a battlefield out there.</b>

262
00:19:08,046 --> 00:19:09,846
<b>Why would anyone volunteer
to work out in the field?</b>

263
00:19:09,876 --> 00:19:10,947
<b>- Exactly.
- Exactly.</b>

264
00:19:11,477 --> 00:19:13,717
<b>But the upper management still
wanted me to give you something.</b>

265
00:19:13,917 --> 00:19:15,187
<b>So make sure you take it.</b>

266
00:19:15,747 --> 00:19:18,386
<b>Hwang Mi Soon,
you need to repay your loan...</b>

267

<b>by the end of this month.</b>

268
00:19:20,126 --> 00:19:22,287
<b>Im Ye Eun, you have to move out...</b>

<b>of the housing provided to you

270
00:19:24,027 --> 00:19:25,027
<b>That will be all.</b>

271
00:19:26,227 --> 00:19:27,296
<b>Hey, wait.</b>

272
00:19:28,796 --> 00:19:30,796
<b>You're blackmailing me.</b>

273
00:19:30,796 --> 00:19:32,167
<b>Do you think I'm here
to convince you?</b>

274
00:19:33,207 --> 00:19:37,136
<b>Where am I supposed to live

275

<b>Don't ask me.</b>

<b>Who's our target?</b>

277
00:19:44,277 --> 00:19:45,717
<b>That's the question

<b>Hi, Barbara Massalitinova.</b>

310
00:25:05,336 --> 00:25:07,037
<b>That was so hard to say.</b>

311
00:25:11,306 --> 00:25:13,007
<b>The thing I'm looking for.</b>

312
00:25:13,876 --> 00:25:15,076
<b>You have it.</b>

313
00:25:15,076 --> 00:25:16,646
<b>There's no such thing.</b>

314
00:25:17,177 --> 00:25:20,177
<b>If you keep pestering me,
I'll call for a guard.</b>

315
00:25:20,177 --> 00:25:22,717
<b>Madam Wu who died in...</b>

316
00:25:22,717 --> 00:25:25,757
<b>the solitary cell three months ago.</b>

317
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:29,126
<b>I bet she left it with you.</b>

318
00:25:29,457 --> 00:25:30,896
<b>I don't know such a person.</b>

319
00:25:30,896 --> 00:25:33,626
<b>No. Do you think I'll let it go...</b>

320
00:25:33,626 --> 00:25:34,927
<b>because you pretend not to?</b>

321
00:25:35,697 --> 00:25:36,937
<b>I can't do that.</b>

322
00:25:36,937 --> 00:25:40,096
<b>I really don't know, okay?</b>

323
00:26:06,156 --> 00:26:08,896
<b>How about we talk this out now?</b>

324
00:26:09,096 --> 00:26:11,467
<b>If I give it to you,
how much will you give me?</b>

325
00:26:11,467 --> 00:26:13,537
<b>You want me to pay you
for holding onto it?</b>

326
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:18,177
<b>I'll be deported
once I get out of here.</b>

327
00:26:18,537 --> 00:26:20,207
<b>I can't just let you have it.</b>

328
00:26:21,747 --> 00:26:22,846
<b>100,000 dollars...</b>

329
00:26:24,046 --> 00:26:27,086
<b>should be enough to get you home.</b>

330
00:26:51,906 --> 00:26:53,076
<b>Keep your word.</b>

331
00:26:53,406 --> 00:26:55,806
<b>For breaking
Immigration Control Law,</b>

332
00:26:55,806 --> 00:26:57,677
<b>you'll be sentenced to
10 more months in prison.</b>

333
00:26:57,947 --> 00:27:01,517
<b>And for industrial espionage,
Barbara Massalitinova,</b>

334
00:27:01,546 --> 00:27:03,116
<b>you'll get
at least three more years.</b>

335
00:27:04,386 --> 00:27:05,417
<b>Congratulations.</b>

336
00:27:08,987 --> 00:27:11,296
<b>Hey! Hey, you mad wench!</b>

337
00:27:13,896 --> 00:27:16,096
<b>I knew she could speak Korean.</b>

338
00:27:35,247 --> 00:27:36,417
<b>(Personnel Transfer)</b>

339
00:27:37,417 --> 00:27:38,957
<b>(Geum Dong Seok, Deputy Head of NIS)</b>

340
00:27:41,187 --> 00:27:44,796
<b>You've aged a lot in three years.</b>

341
00:27:44,997 --> 00:27:46,697
<b>Your seat doesn't agree with you?</b>

342
00:27:46,697 --> 00:27:48,427
<b>We lost Michael because of you,</b>

343
00:27:48,427 --> 00:27:50,836
<b>and I barely clawed my way back
from certain death.</b>

344
00:27:51,066 --> 00:27:52,566
<b>How could I look okay?</b>

345
00:27:57,306 --> 00:27:59,106
<b>That was my only mistake.</b>

346
00:27:59,306 --> 00:28:00,947
<b>Give me a chance to make up for it.</b>

347
00:28:00,947 --> 00:28:01,977
<b>Sure.</b>

348
00:28:02,477 --> 00:28:04,777
<b>That's why you
came to prison, right?</b>

349
00:28:07,146 --> 00:28:08,146
<b>Turn around.</b>

350
00:28:15,257 --> 00:28:17,126
<b>When did you join forces
with the deputy head?</b>

351
00:28:17,796 --> 00:28:20,527
<b>Are you upset I made a deal with him
behind your back?</b>

352
00:28:20,527 --> 00:28:23,096
<b>If you ruin my plans again
like you did three years ago,</b>

353
00:28:23,326 --> 00:28:24,997
<b>I will not let you off.</b>

354
00:28:27,106 --> 00:28:28,437
<b>Don't worry.</b>

355
00:28:28,836 --> 00:28:30,507
<b>I'll wrap it up with "TOP".</b>

356
00:28:30,507 --> 00:28:31,636
<b>"TOP"?</b>

357
00:28:31,636 --> 00:28:34,606
<b>In time, without going overboard,</b>

358
00:28:34,606 --> 00:28:35,876
<b>perfectly.</b>

359
00:28:37,447 --> 00:28:38,477
<b>Shall we?</b>

360
00:28:58,636 --> 00:29:00,566
<b>Will this team be trustworthy?</b>

361
00:29:00,906 --> 00:29:01,967
<b>What do you mean?</b>

362
00:29:02,106 --> 00:29:03,467
<b>Three years ago,</b>

363
00:29:03,707 --> 00:29:06,237
<b>a jerk of a teammate
I trusted with my life...</b>

364
00:29:06,237 --> 00:29:08,106
<b>gave me a really hard time.</b>

365
00:29:08,507 --> 00:29:10,846
<b>He told the boss
that I took a bribe...</b>

366
00:29:10,977 --> 00:29:12,346
<b>to let Michael go.</b>

367
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:15,187
<b>Who was it?</b>

368
00:29:17,757 --> 00:29:19,257
<b>It can't have been you.</b>

369
00:29:20,927 --> 00:29:23,527
<b>This team will be fine
as long as you behave.</b>

370
00:29:29,697 --> 00:29:31,596
<b>I'm excited!</b>

371
00:29:31,596 --> 00:29:35,136
<b>What amazing aces
did you put in line for me?</b>

372
00:29:57,086 --> 00:29:58,126
<b>Long time no see.</b>

373
00:29:58,927 --> 00:30:00,056
<b>Not really.</b>

374
00:30:00,096 --> 00:30:01,497
<b>You came to visit me in prison
last week.</b>

375
00:30:01,866 --> 00:30:03,796
<b>I heard you were in jail.</b>

376
00:30:03,967 --> 00:30:06,937
<b>My body must've gotten used to
solitary confinement.</b>

377
00:30:07,437 --> 00:30:10,037
<b>It's quite awkward to sit
on something so comfortable.</b>

378
00:30:10,606 --> 00:30:13,306
<b>Okay, let's catch up while we eat.</b>

379
00:30:13,306 --> 00:30:14,376
<b>Wait.</b>

380
00:30:16,177 --> 00:30:17,977
<b>Where did you bring
that rookie from?</b>

381
00:30:18,217 --> 00:30:19,316
<b>The industry team?</b>

382
00:30:19,376 --> 00:30:20,987
<b>The international team?
Or the terror team?</b>

383
00:30:21,616 --> 00:30:25,356
<b>I worked for the support team in
the industrial security department.</b>

384
00:30:25,356 --> 00:30:26,417
<b>What?</b>

385
00:30:28,227 --> 00:30:31,056
<b>One is an old lady who hasn't
been in the field for years.</b>

386
00:30:31,056 --> 00:30:33,027
<b>And the other one is a rookie
who's only seen stuff...</b>

387
00:30:33,027 --> 00:30:34,227
<b>through a monitor?</b>

388
00:30:39,396 --> 00:30:42,537
<b>Do you want me to succeed,
or do you want me to mess up?</b>

389
00:30:42,537 --> 00:30:45,636
<b>That's why the deputy head
personally asked for you.</b>

390
00:30:45,636 --> 00:30:48,777
<b>He knew that you'd do better
than 10 ordinary agents.</b>

391
00:30:48,777 --> 00:30:50,646
<b>But she's no longer a team leader.
She's just an agent.</b>

392
00:30:51,017 --> 00:30:53,546
<b>If you act up like how you used to
when you were a team leader,</b>

393
00:30:53,876 --> 00:30:55,787
<b>I'll just kick you off the team.</b>

394
00:30:56,386 --> 00:30:57,957
<b>You know me, right?
I do what I want...</b>

395
00:30:57,957 --> 00:30:59,187
<b>once I make up my mind.</b>

396
00:30:59,287 --> 00:31:00,316
<b>Yes, I know.</b>

397
00:31:00,687 --> 00:31:02,556
<b>You were like that when we broke up.</b>

398
00:31:03,626 --> 00:31:04,927
<b>Are you kidding me?</b>

399
00:31:04,957 --> 00:31:07,096
<b>What? People talk about it
behind our backs anyway.</b>

400
00:31:07,096 --> 00:31:08,566
<b>So it's better to be
honest about it.</b>

401
00:31:08,566 --> 00:31:09,896
<b>You haven't changed at all.</b>

402
00:31:09,896 --> 00:31:11,767
<b>You don't care about others.</b>

403
00:31:11,767 --> 00:31:12,997
<b>You think you're the best,
don't you?</b>

404
00:31:12,997 --> 00:31:14,007
<b>Obviously.</b>

405
00:31:14,336 --> 00:31:17,507
<b>I even went to prison all by myself
because that's how good I am.</b>

406
00:31:19,876 --> 00:31:23,477
<b>Well, it looks like
we all get the point.</b>

407
00:31:23,477 --> 00:31:25,146
<b>Shall we start eating then?</b>

408
00:31:26,046 --> 00:31:29,247
<b>I'll order five Course A meals.</b>

409
00:31:29,287 --> 00:31:30,316
<b>- Sure.
- Okay.</b>

410
00:31:46,037 --> 00:31:48,106
<b>You're the type of guy...</b>

411
00:31:48,537 --> 00:31:50,636
<b>who's very careful and skeptical.</b>

412
00:31:51,406 --> 00:31:53,937
<b>What if I join forces with Michael?</b>

413
00:31:55,177 --> 00:31:57,677
<b>Are you warning me
before you betray us?</b>

414
00:31:57,677 --> 00:31:58,777
<b>I didn't get dismissed...</b>

415
00:31:58,816 --> 00:31:59,977
<b>because our bosses
wanted to save face.</b>

416
00:32:00,517 --> 00:32:02,046
<b>But I bet no one trusts me anymore.</b>

417
00:32:02,046 --> 00:32:03,747
<b>No one barely knows
because it's confidential.</b>

418
00:32:04,487 --> 00:32:06,586
<b>And I never thought of you
as someone...</b>

419
00:32:06,586 --> 00:32:08,287
<b>who'd do something like that.</b>

420
00:32:08,586 --> 00:32:10,527
<b>- How can you be so sure?
- You may be...</b>

421
00:32:10,527 --> 00:32:11,796
<b>out of control sometimes.</b>

422
00:32:12,727 --> 00:32:14,296
<b>But you never cross the line.</b>

423
00:32:25,237 --> 00:32:28,846
<b>About Baek Chan Mi...</b>

424
00:32:28,846 --> 00:32:29,906
<b>Yes?</b>

425
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:31,947
<b>Why did she go to prison?</b>

426
00:32:33,277 --> 00:32:35,017
<b>She didn't go there
because she did anything wrong.</b>

427
00:32:35,747 --> 00:32:36,787
<b>She went there
as an undercover agent.</b>

428
00:32:37,247 --> 00:32:39,717
<b>I see. I get it now.</b>

429
00:32:39,717 --> 00:32:42,086
<b>But you'd better brace yourself...</b>

430
00:32:43,626 --> 00:32:44,757
<b>now that she's in our team.</b>

431
00:32:45,197 --> 00:32:46,227
<b>What?</b>

432
00:32:47,967 --> 00:32:49,197
<b>The tiger is here.</b>

433
00:32:51,937 --> 00:32:53,336
<b>This is your first time
doing fieldwork?</b>

434
00:32:54,507 --> 00:32:55,507
<b>Yes.</b>

435
00:32:55,566 --> 00:32:59,406
<b>I'm lacking in many ways,
but I'll try my best to learn a lot.</b>

436
00:32:59,406 --> 00:33:00,906
<b>I don't care how much you lack.</b>

437
00:33:00,906 --> 00:33:02,477
<b>And don't even try to learn stuff.</b>

438
00:33:02,606 --> 00:33:05,076
<b>When we're out in the field,
there's no time to teach you stuff.</b>

439
00:33:05,146 --> 00:33:08,217
<b>Okay, then I'll do my best.</b>

440
00:33:08,217 --> 00:33:10,447
<b>That kind of mindset
only works in the office.</b>

441
00:33:11,517 --> 00:33:13,886
<b>But that can't bring
a dead person back to life.</b>

442
00:33:16,126 --> 00:33:19,396
<b>I want you to bring 100 sheets
of shooting paper by next week.</b>

443
00:33:19,697 --> 00:33:20,727
<b>"100 sheets"?</b>

444
00:33:20,727 --> 00:33:22,066
<b>It's not so you can shoot people.</b>

445
00:33:22,326 --> 00:33:23,727
<b>I just want you to protect yourself.</b>

446
00:33:24,197 --> 00:33:26,467
<b>And I'll see you at the gym
every day at 6 a.m...</b>

447
00:33:26,767 --> 00:33:27,767
<b>so we can train together.</b>

448
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:32,106
<b>But I have a kid.</b>

449
00:33:33,007 --> 00:33:35,777
<b>I think 6 a.m. would be
too early for me.</b>

450
00:33:36,406 --> 00:33:39,376
<b>You look young.
I'm surprised you have a kid.</b>

451
00:33:41,586 --> 00:33:42,987
<b>Then let's make it 6 p.m.</b>

452
00:33:50,826 --> 00:33:52,197
<b>Do you get what I mean?</b>

453
00:34:00,859 --> 00:34:03,029
<b>Whatever. I'm just going to eat it.</b>

454
00:34:03,029 --> 00:34:04,369
<b>Do you want one too?</b>

455
00:34:04,369 --> 00:34:05,470
<b>No?</b>

456
00:34:05,529 --> 00:34:09,099
<b>Ye Eun, will you come with us
to the indoor playground?</b>

457
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,569
<b>The indoor playground?</b>

458
00:34:10,569 --> 00:34:13,140
<b>Goodness. I see you didn't
check the chatroom.</b>

459
00:34:13,609 --> 00:34:16,309
<b>We agreed to all go today.</b>

460
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:19,509
