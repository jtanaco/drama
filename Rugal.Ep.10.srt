PORTRAYED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,740
EPISODE 10

4
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:14,590
<i>They restored the power.</i>

5
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:16,790
Gwang-cheol, turn the lights on.

6
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:47,990
I expected this, but this is worse than I imagined.

7
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:50,190
What they did to us doesn't even come close to this.

8
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:52,160
There's no point talking about it.

9
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:54,630
Should we catch the guys we saw at the entrance first?

10
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:57,900
Let's not catch them. Instead, we should crush them there.

11
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,040
Securing Dr. Oh takes priority.

12
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:28,030
MISSING PERSON AN YU-MIN

13
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:32,030
He's a missing person.

14
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:33,670
He went missing in 2018.

15
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:35,570
A professional basketball player, An Yu-min.

16
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:39,340
They'll take anyone they can get their hands on.

17
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:42,180
If they want to create an army, they should use their men.

18
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,040
This isn't research, but a massacre.

19
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,550
This ends today.

20
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:48,550
This is the only exit. Let's split and meet back here again.

21
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:52,290
And we'll let the police rescue the victims as always.

22
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:55,360
Gi-beom, check the entrance.

23
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:58,860
Mi-na, sweep the area where the electrical accident took place.

24
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:01,730
Gwang-cheol, search the basement.

25
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:11,600
DANGER: ULTRA-HIGH-VOLTAGE TRANSMISSION

26
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,370
Who are you?

27
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:21,670
Have you seen a man named Oh Gwang-su?

28
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:23,010
Oh Gwang-su?

29
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:25,450
I see. The former doctor from K Hospital...

30
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:31,120
Who the heck are you?

31
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:39,160
What's your problem?

32
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,970
That can't be.

33
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:49,300
The subbasement is cleared.

34
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,690
The electricity room is cleared.

35
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:16,690
<i>It seems like Dr. Oh was moved somewhere else.</i>

36
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:18,760
<i>What? When?</i>

37
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:20,530
Someone saw us when we entered.

38
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:23,760
-Then, Dr. Oh isn't here? -That's my guess.

39
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:26,000
<i>I'm sure it was part of their protocol.</i>

40
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,070
Given the incident, he was the first one to get moved.

41
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:35,410
-We'll be on our move, too. <i>-Okay.</i>

42
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:37,940
But we can't leave this place like this, Tae-woong.

43
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:44,580
As Dr. Oh isn't here, there's no point for us to be careful.

44
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:48,720
Let's meet back safely at where we parted earlier while leaving

45
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,390
a lot of damages behind.

46
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,390
I'm so glad to hear that.

47
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:55,090
I must check where he might be. I'll meet you there.

48
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,600
-That's my plan, too. -Same here.

49
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,570
I need to check something.

50
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:17,080
My parents must be worried.

51
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,650
Can I call them

52
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:22,720
to let them know I'm fine and they don't have to worry?

53
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,920
Or I can just text them.

54
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:32,470
Who are you?

55
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:50,150
The way out of here will be rough.

56
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,150
Do you want to wear this?

57
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,300
Can we slow down a bit?

58
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:10,370
My goodness. What's happening?

59
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,420
Just kill me already.

60
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:27,520
It's a waste of time.

61
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:31,860
I did everything I was asked. Why are you doing this to me?

62
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:47,370
<i>The number you are calling cannot be reached.</i>

63
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:50,680
YE-WON

64
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:56,920
<i>The number you are calling cannot be reached.</i>

65
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,890
She's not answering my calls. Did the negotiation fall through?

66
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:05,660
According to Man-cheol, Deuk-gu was going to get him out right away.

67
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:11,130
You know what? Chairwoman Choi confuses me these days.

68
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,230
What do you mean?

69
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:17,640
She gathered us up and asked for our help to bring him down.

70
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:21,070
But this afternoon, she stuck up for him because he's the vice-chairman.

71
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:24,210
Don't you know that the position shapes the person?

72
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:26,450
If she's not qualified for it, she's out.

73
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,820
I'm worried about my later years.

74
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,120
I can't even retire with some peace in my mind.

75
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:37,420
What? Do you want to join the game?

76
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,830
Let's do a few rounds when Man-cheol gets out.

77
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:01,450
WHERE ARE YOU?

78
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:05,620
CASE BY CASE

79
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:41,120
Are you planning to jump?

80
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:44,460
We're almost there. Be patient.

81
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:50,630
What's that watch?

82
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:52,870
What the heck are you up to?

83
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,800
You're the chairwoman.

84
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:58,700
Why are you so scared?

85
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,830
Who would believe that?

86
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:26,600
The almighty chairwoman of Argos reached out to the police

87
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,640
because she felt threatened by her loyal vice-chairman, Hwang Deuk-gu.

88
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:32,270
Stop the car.

89
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:33,810
Pull over now!

90
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,210
Excuse me.

91
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,210
Hey.

92
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:34,570
Please put something in my eye sockets.

93
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:36,340
Please.

94
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:40,470
Dr. Oh, you said you would never do it,

95
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:42,210
but did you know

96
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:46,550
that I'm even more scared now than the time when they brought me here?

97
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:50,280
I must be able to see if I want to do anything.

98
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:01,660
What happened?

99
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,300
Who are you?

100
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,570
I'm sorry.

101
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:11,240
Pretend you didn't hear that.

102
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,940
I don't know anything!

103
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:20,550
Tell me what they did to you.

104
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:23,150
I don't care if you kill me,

105
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:25,420
but please spare my daughter.

106
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:27,520
Was she kidnapped here, too?

107
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:30,760
You killed my daughter, didn't you?

108
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:33,160
You came in to tell me that, right?

109
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:35,660
Answer me!

110
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:38,830
Answer me, you murderer!

111
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:42,000
Bring her back!

112
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,150
Murderer...

113
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,290
THE SICK MURDERER KANG GI-BEOM

114
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:06,260
Kang Gi-beom is a murderer.

115
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:25,480
<i>Kill them.</i>

116
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:31,880
Gi-beom.

117
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,050
<i>Test subject.</i>

118
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:10,780
Stop it.

119
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:31,940
Calm down, Gi-beom. Compose yourself!

120
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:01,470
I did this, didn't I?

121
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:03,870
Yes.

122
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:07,610
-And I attacked you, too, Tae-woong? -What happened?

123
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,540
I don't know.

124
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,850
Everyone looked like test subjects to me.

125
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:19,080
-That's not exactly wrong. -It's not right, either.

126
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:22,590
Is it some kind of error?

127
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:26,630
If you didn't stop me, I might have killed you, too.

128
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:28,960
I couldn't control myself.

129
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,870
If it was an error, we can fix it.

130
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:35,030
If I can bring you back like now,

131
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:37,270
that's good for me.

132
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:41,610
Are you okay now?

133
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,380
Yes.

134
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,020
-You're back. -Yes.

135
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:52,020
-Is it just the two of us here? -The two of us?

136
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:53,450
Yes.

137
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:55,990
Who else is here except for you and me?

138
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,390
Well...

139
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:16,910
-Don't try to talk me out of this. -Hey.

140
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:22,480
I'm sorry. I wasn't talking to you.

141
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,450
You come here.

142
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:29,020
How could you bring her here?

143
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:32,520
What are you going to say to Tae-woong?

144
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,630
-If the chief finds out-- -He'll destroy me

145
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:36,530
and put me in the solitary cell.

146
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,430
So what's your plan?

147
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:41,770
Let's just bring her outside. Deal?

148
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:44,870
You're not offering me anything. That's not a deal.

149
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:48,140
You're on your own.

150
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:52,780
Who is she?

151
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:55,080
Let's escort her outside the building.

152
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,520
Leave her here. The police will be here any minute.

153
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,690
It's too dangerous for us to leave her here.

154
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:01,850
They put a chip in her body. It's dangerous.

155
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:03,290
Chip?

156
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,490
I want her to be the first person the police find.

157
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:16,600
There might be more of them here.

158
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,840
Mi-na and I will guard the front and back.

159
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,610
Gi-beom, you'll lead.

160
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:23,410
Thank you, Tae-woong.

161
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:26,950
-Let's go. -Gi-beom.

162
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:28,810
Are you okay?

163
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,620
Yes. I'm fine. Let's go.

164
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:05,350
Once we leave, take off the blindfold.

165
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:09,220
And keep walking this way.

166
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:13,230
The police will be coming from there. You'll see them soon.

167
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:18,630
Take me with you.

168
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:25,840
I'll keep this a secret.

169
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:29,140
Please protect me.

170
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:37,320
-Take her to the headquarters. -What about you?

171
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,790
I'll go back on my own.

172
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:42,490
See you at the headquarters.

173
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:04,110
This got exposed?

174
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,550
The police are everywhere.

175
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:12,620
I doubt that you called the police

176
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:15,490
to turn yourself in out of guilt for what you did to me.

177
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:19,220
Don't hold your breath for it.

178
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:21,430
If your businesses keep getting exposed,

179
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:24,160
how will you make up for the monetary losses?

180
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:32,940
What happened to Director Gu and that darned doctor?

181
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:35,870
Seol Min-jun moved them to a safe place.

182
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:37,980
Everyone is doing their job.

183
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:41,010
What have you done to stop this getting out of control?

184
00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:42,680
I was guarding the gate.

185
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:45,220
There's only one entrance here.

186
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:47,790
-I thought guarding the gate-- -So,

187
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:50,260
did you stop them?

188
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:52,690
Logically speaking, it worked out in my head.

189
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:55,090
But you know, our bodies need us to discharge some stuff.

190
00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:56,960
And I had to smoke a few cigarettes--

191
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:02,530
I can assure you that it wasn't Kang Gi-beom.

192
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:05,440
It's as clear as day this is his doing. You're telling me it's not?

193
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,640
I even checked the face myself.

194
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:12,080
He waltzes into Argo's operations as if it's his own.

195
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:15,950
He makes a royal mess and finishes up with the police.

196
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:17,720
Can't you see?

197
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,750
We're getting exposed more and more,

198
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:23,390
but those bastards are getting cocky.

199
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:27,560
I'm so busy, straightening out the people who betray us.

200
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,930
But you failed to do one simple task of guarding the gate.

201
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:32,230
How dare you talk that nonsense to me?

202
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:36,100
You bastard. You too. Just die!

203
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:38,640
Die. Just die, you bastard.

204
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:45,710
Boss, wait.

205
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:48,010
Boss...

206
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:50,420
I'll go catch her. Please?

207
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:52,180
You seem

208
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:55,650
to be destined to live a long life.

209
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,930
-Go get her... -Yes, sir.

210
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:03,530
-...unless you have a death wish. -Yes, sir.

211
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:34,330
Hey, we need to report first.

212
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,670
My gosh.

213
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,640
Hello.

214
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:49,410
Who is she?

215
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:51,110
We brought her from there.

216
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:54,580
Does Chief Choi know?

217
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:56,720
He will. Soon.

218
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,480
"Soon"? I never saw her, then.

219
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,150
Gosh, come on.

220
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,560
Just remove the chip behind her neck.

221
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:08,360
Gwang-cheol, ask Susan if you need help with something like that.

222
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:14,200
It can blow up anytime like Kim Dae-sik and other test subjects did.

223
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,670
Gwang-cheol, please don't test me like this.

224
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:26,340
Just follow his instructions.

225
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:29,850
Whose instructions? I never saw her.

226
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:31,720
Come on.

227
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:36,690
Follow this handsome guy's instructions.

228
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:39,760
You'll remove the thing on the back of my neck, right?

229
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:44,460
Gosh, what a headache.

230
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:49,530
Why is everyone doing this to me these days? Gosh, my head hurts.

231
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:53,940
Gi-beom found the person who had come in contact with Dr. Oh,

232
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:56,210
but we couldn't find anything else.

233
00:24:56,410 --> 00:24:59,710
I knew it. Dr. Oh sent us a signal.

234
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:04,350
What if he's alive, but this imperils his life even more?

235
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:05,920
Now, one thing is certain.

236
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:09,090
They abducted him to use him, not to kill him.

237
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:11,520
Isn't that more dangerous?

238
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:16,130
I'm always prepared to deal with something like this, and so was Dr. Oh.

239
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:19,000
He'd never cooperate. And even if he does,

240
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,200
I'm sure he has a plan, so don't worry.

241
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:25,370
Then what should we do now?

242
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:27,540
Leave this to me.

243
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:29,810
What about Gi-beom and Gwang-cheol?

244
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:31,910
Gi-beom is on his way back.

245
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:36,720
Gwang-cheol has a minor injury, so I sent him to Bradley.

246
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,950
Okay. You two should get some rest too.

247
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:41,350
Yes, sir.

248
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:09,950
<i>Right, it's understandable.</i>

249
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:13,020
<i>Those bastards deserved something even worse.</i>

250
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,490
<i>Test subject.</i>

251
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:27,000
<i>Why did I do that?</i>

252
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,870
<i>Did I mistake him for a test subject?</i>

253
00:26:37,810 --> 00:26:39,610
<i>Aggression detected.</i>

254
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,910
-Shit. -<i>Has the defensive instinct been upgraded?</i>

255
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:48,150
-Are you all right? -Don't touch me.

256
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:57,100
<i>Murder success probability, 73 percent.</i>

257
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:59,400
What the heck is this? Get rid of this.

258
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,670
Why are you suddenly all quiet? Get rid of it!

259
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:03,370
<i>I will delete it.</i>

260
00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:06,970
Jeez, today is not my day.

261
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:43,540
That goofball. When did he have time to do this?

262
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:54,710
Good to see you alive.

263
00:28:57,180 --> 00:29:00,720
People are still debating whether or not you're the killer and if you're dead.

264
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:04,490
It's not that simple.

265
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,960
What is your real job?

266
00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:09,060
I'm after Argos.

267
00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:11,930
Then did you approach me intentionally?

268
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:13,630
Will my answer change anything?

269
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:17,240
I was going to say, it won't.

270
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:23,910
Our contract is still valid, right?

271
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:26,750
-What if the answer is yes? -You'll need me.

272
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:29,410
Do you trust me?

273
00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:31,920
Someone's tailing us.

274
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:04,450
All knocked out.

275
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:09,650
Look at this bloody mess. Don't you feel a sense of despair?

276
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:16,330
He risked his own life and walked into it just to provoke me.

277
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,530
I really want to get my hands on him.

278
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:22,930
Are you all right, sir?

279
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,840
Don't worry about me.

280
00:30:27,010 --> 00:30:29,510
I'm seeing what you probably can't see.

281
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:32,810
He's different.

282
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:36,210
He doesn't go all bonkers, swept up in anger.

283
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:40,520
He wants to play with me, so he's coming at me with everything he's got.

284
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:43,490
If that's what he wants,

285
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:47,690
I shall put him on the game board and play with him.

286
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:50,430
You can get ready, right?

287
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:52,300
Yes, sir.

288
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,730
Let's go eat something.

289
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,980
Gwang-cheol is so stubborn.

290
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:09,380
He's usually easy going though.

291
00:31:09,810 --> 00:31:12,780
-He's not like that all the time. -He's reckless.

292
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:16,050
Sure, the surgery is fine. But what about after that?

293
00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:17,590
We should save her life first.

294
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:20,430
It'll take her a while to fully recover.

295
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:24,460
You sound so unconcerned.

296
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:26,500
You're making me look petty-minded.

297
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:29,930
I'll worry about it later.

298
00:31:30,170 --> 00:31:32,370
There's something more important right now.

299
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,270
What's going on?

300
00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:35,770
It's about Gi-beom.

301
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:37,310
What about him?

302
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:41,580
I saw him getting out of control.

303
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:43,310
Did he have a shutdown?

304
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:46,450
No, I think it was a different kind of error.

305
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:51,120
I guess he acted recklessly.

306
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:53,290
Yes.

307
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,830
"The whispers of the artificial eyes."

308
00:31:56,090 --> 00:31:58,200
That's what Chief Choi calls it.

309
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:00,970
"Whispers"?

310
00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:03,740
When you get used to relying on the artificial eyes,

311
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:06,740
you experience moments when you're not thinking of your own accord.

312
00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:09,570
That's when they whisper to you to lure you.

313
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:12,940
"Hand over full control."

314
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:15,350
So, the more you use them,

315
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:16,510
the more they control you?

316
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:19,750
They're a strong tool, so there's a big price to pay.

317
00:32:20,050 --> 00:32:21,420
That's why...

318
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:22,790
What?

319
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,560
To tell you the truth, there's a safety device.

320
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,200
I have it.

321
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,400
You?

322
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:37,000
Gi-beom and I are the only ones with the chip, you know.

323
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,140
The thing for your blood flow and body balance?

324
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:42,870
Yes, Chief Choi linked it to that device.

325
00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:45,280
-They're linked? -Not always.

326
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:47,880
When Gi-beom loses his sense of self

327
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:50,250
or gets emotional,

328
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:53,690
I get a signal.

329
00:32:58,890 --> 00:33:00,990
His emotional state is shared with you?

330
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:03,430
Yes, you can say that.

331
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:08,130
To tell you the truth, I felt it when we were at the lab earlier.

332
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:32,560
Well, it does catch me off guard at times.

333
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:34,730
But it's not always bad.

334
00:34:10,530 --> 00:34:12,300
<i>Maybe that's why.</i>

335
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:17,900
<i>From time to time, Gi-beom and I feel and act the same way.</i>

336
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:22,370
<i>We even wind up in the exact same places at times.</i>

337
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:26,680
<i>I worry about him.</i>

338
00:34:27,850 --> 00:34:29,650
But in a way, it's nice.

339
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:34,220
I envy you guys for that.

340
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:38,590
Being able to share so much as teammates.

341
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,260
Well, I guess.

342
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:43,690
I'm just not cut out for that.

343
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,960
Understanding others and being communicative.

344
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,670
Gosh, what are you talking about?

345
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:49,870
You're so good at it.

346
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:51,270
With you?

347
00:34:54,910 --> 00:34:56,870
Well...

348
00:34:57,410 --> 00:34:58,680
Yes.

349
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:34,180
This is Hwang Deuk-gu's car, so he'll track it down soon.

350
00:35:34,410 --> 00:35:36,480
Let's have some tea and part ways.

351
00:35:37,350 --> 00:35:40,420
So we can call it even and start afresh with a clean slate?

352
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:41,820
That'd be nice too.

353
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:23,930
Shit. Damn it!

354
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:25,700
Fuck!

355
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:30,070
As for the plan to whack Hwang Deuk-gu at the party...

356
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:31,640
Some stuff happened.

357
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:34,340
Yes. The same goes for me,

358
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:36,410
so you don't owe me an explanation.

359
00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:38,680
One of his businesses got destroyed.

360
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:41,650
Was that also you?

361
00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:43,750
It wasn't intentional.

362
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:49,650
But you know what? If I seem a little off

363
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:51,760
next time you see me,

364
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,460
just avoid me.

365
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:54,630
Okay?

366
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,430
I have to say,

367
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,600
there are so many obstacles between us.

368
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,970
But one thing is for sure.

369
00:37:03,970 --> 00:37:06,470
We're bound to cross paths again.

370
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:07,870
Right?

371
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:21,690
Can you explain why Hwang Deuk-gu had this?

372
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:25,720
Well, there was a bit of a situation.

373
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:31,460
Can I call you when I want to hear your voice?

374
00:37:37,170 --> 00:37:41,070
If you need to talk to me about something, I won't avoid you.

375
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:11,200
Get in. I'll take you to your master.

376
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,000
Thank you, ma'am--

377
00:38:14,210 --> 00:38:17,070
Come on. Don't be like this, ma'am.

378
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,180
Jeez, whatever.

379
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,730
"Mentally and physically incompetent"?

380
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:38,360
Did you really have to make me look like a crazy moron?

381
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:40,300
Who cares? You got out.

382
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:42,170
That's all that matters.

383
00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:45,870
Madame Jang, would you trust me with your money?

384
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:47,240
The CEO is a moron.

385
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:49,010
Would you do business with his bank?

386
00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:51,680
Private loans won't be affected at all, you know.

387
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:53,410
If you're that worried,

388
00:38:53,410 --> 00:38:55,910
you can let me handle the secondary market.

389
00:38:55,910 --> 00:38:58,950
-What? -Gosh, enough.

390
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:01,690
She's just worried about you.

391
00:39:01,690 --> 00:39:03,990
In any case, you got out.

392
00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:06,460
Let's drink to celebrate.

393
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:17,370
Well, I heard that Hwang Deuk-gu got attacked too.

394
00:39:17,370 --> 00:39:19,840
What? That bastard?

395
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,710
Do you remember the place

396
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:23,610
where he took us after we got shot?

397
00:39:23,610 --> 00:39:25,740
Yes. It looked like a hospital.

398
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:27,350
I heard it got destroyed.

399
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,850
Really? Who did it?

400
00:39:29,850 --> 00:39:31,920
When Hwang Deuk-gu visited me,

401
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,420
he said some punks are after us.

402
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:34,920
We're not their target.

403
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:36,690
It's Hwang Deuk-gu.

404
00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:39,590
I don't know who they are, but they're clearly

405
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:41,530
after Hwang Deuk-gu.

406
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:44,300
I don't know who those lunatics are,

407
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,870
but I want to start their fan club or something.

408
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,940
Come on. Don't laugh.

409
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:52,770
Can't you see that I got hurt too?

410
00:39:52,770 --> 00:39:55,710
If you don't want to deal with something worse,

411
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:57,580
you'd better listen up.

412
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:09,150
Gosh, Madame Jang. Is this the only booze you have?

413
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:10,990
Give us something better.

414
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:14,020
Why now? We're talking.

415
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:19,930
Gosh, seriously.

416
00:40:32,010 --> 00:40:35,880
Hwang Deuk-gu has the key for the safe in your office.

417
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:39,350
What? It needs to scan my palm to be unlocked.

418
00:40:39,350 --> 00:40:42,690
You know he'd do anything to figure out a way.

419
00:40:43,450 --> 00:40:47,860
You'd better protect the VIP vault from him.

420
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:52,100
Hwang Deuk-gu, that fucker...

421
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:53,500
Gosh.

422
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:10,510
I'm pretty sure no one invited you today.

423
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:23,130
Don't let anyone in.

424
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,560
I want to drink alone.

425
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:28,000
Get him a separate room.

426
00:41:59,130 --> 00:42:00,500
Hwang Deuk-gu is here.

427
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:03,270
You mean, now? That fucker is here?

428
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:05,570
Yes, he just got here.

429
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:07,510
He's in a room over there.

430
00:42:14,610 --> 00:42:17,010
I should give back what I received.

431
00:42:37,330 --> 00:42:39,600
Hey, Hwang Deuk-gu.

432
00:42:52,650 --> 00:42:54,390
You don't need to thank me.

433
00:42:54,390 --> 00:42:55,720
If you're that grateful,

434
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:58,660
just shut up and lie low.

435
00:42:59,490 --> 00:43:02,230
What the hell are you saying?

436
00:43:02,490 --> 00:43:05,130
If I'm "grateful"?

437
00:43:06,630 --> 00:43:10,600
You can either shut up and drink with me or get out.

438
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:12,140
Choose one.

439
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:29,390
What? Does this piss you off because I snatched your drink

440
00:43:29,390 --> 00:43:31,520
when you're so used to stealing shit?

441
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,420
You thief.

442
00:43:33,990 --> 00:43:36,630
How dare you go through my vault?

443
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:12,660
Who do you think the real owner of Argos is?

444
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:14,900
Argos?

445
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:18,570
It belongs to us, who faithfully served Chairman Ko.

446
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:24,340
At this very moment, who can decide whether you can live or not?

447
00:44:39,390 --> 00:44:40,720
What's going on?

448
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:44,330
I heard your business got destroyed.

449
00:44:44,330 --> 00:44:48,570
Apparently, so many people are out to get you.

450
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:09,750
Gosh, don't be like this. My goodness!

451
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:12,460
I was rude, wasn't I?

452
00:45:12,690 --> 00:45:15,130
You can't really say that thing is yours.

453
00:45:15,790 --> 00:45:17,590
Sure, I went through it.

454
00:45:17,590 --> 00:45:19,800
What's wrong with that?

455
00:45:22,370 --> 00:45:26,000
God, seriously! Drop the gun, will you?

456
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,270
You shouldn't have made me pick it up in the first place.

457
00:45:29,270 --> 00:45:31,080
I gave you a chance to make your choice.

458
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:33,540
-I'm already holding the gun, -Gosh.

459
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:35,010
so I should finish the job.

460
00:45:35,010 --> 00:45:38,020
What? "Finish the job"? What job?

461
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:40,720
If you want to be spared, choose one.

462
00:45:41,090 --> 00:45:43,190
Choi Yong or Madame Jang?

463
00:45:43,190 --> 00:45:45,460
You'll have to kill one of them.

464
00:45:45,790 --> 00:45:47,420
What? What did you say?

465
00:45:50,590 --> 00:45:54,130
You need to pay for acting rashly.

466
00:45:54,630 --> 00:45:56,900
Gosh, hey. Please drop the gun.

467
00:45:57,030 --> 00:46:01,910
My goodness, I'm injured. Gosh!

468
00:46:36,670 --> 00:46:38,780
Change the D-day to today.

469
00:46:38,780 --> 00:46:40,010
Get started.

470
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:46,750
You told me something

471
00:46:46,750 --> 00:46:48,720
about the blackout.

472
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:51,160
You said an error could occur

473
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:53,090
if the recovery process is ignored.

474
00:46:53,090 --> 00:46:55,560
You said it was like opening Pandora's box.

475
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:56,930
Right.

476
00:46:57,590 --> 00:46:59,060
I guess I said something like that.

477
00:46:59,060 --> 00:47:01,470
You guess? Unbelievable.

478
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:03,930
The resetting process didn't work this afternoon.

479
00:47:03,930 --> 00:47:05,600
Are you sure it's not an error?

480
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:08,470
Like I said, no technical errors occurred.

481
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:10,310
But...

482
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:12,280
But what?

483
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:17,610
Well,

484
00:47:18,150 --> 00:47:22,090
I still don't know whether it's a bug or a major error,

485
00:47:22,090 --> 00:47:24,590
but your artificial eyes sometimes reveal themselves.

486
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:26,960
What? When did that happen?

487
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:30,260
There are gaps among the synapses in our brain

488
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:33,600
that conveys electrical and chemical responses.

489
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:36,070
A highly developed deep learning process of the AI

490
00:47:36,230 --> 00:47:38,400
could lead to your artificial eyes

491
00:47:39,170 --> 00:47:41,000
reading that information too.

492
00:47:41,410 --> 00:47:45,980
Are you saying that my artificial eyes could hijack my thoughts?

493
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:49,150
It will seem foreign to you at first,

494
00:47:49,150 --> 00:47:52,150
but as time goes by, you'll be confused as to

495
00:47:52,150 --> 00:47:54,550
which are your own thoughts.

496
00:47:55,490 --> 00:47:58,860
This is just my theory though,

497
00:47:58,860 --> 00:48:01,590
so it can't be applied to your case.

498
00:48:04,930 --> 00:48:06,530
What if,

499
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:09,100
and this is a big if...

500
00:48:09,330 --> 00:48:12,440
What happens if the artificial eyes take control of me?

501
00:48:17,340 --> 00:48:20,080
You will lose yourself and live by its orders.

502
00:48:22,310 --> 00:48:24,620
What can I do to stop it?

503
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:35,060
What about the young lady?

504
00:48:35,060 --> 00:48:36,430
The procedure was a success.

505
00:48:36,430 --> 00:48:38,660
She'll be sent away once she recovers.

506
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:40,830
I'm ready to be tossed in solitary,

507
00:48:40,830 --> 00:48:43,200
so I'll be telling the chief what happened.

508
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:45,740
-Sure. -Thank you

509
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,770
for letting me do this.

510
00:48:48,210 --> 00:48:51,210
I didn't do anything. It was Tae-woong who approved.

511
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:53,440
This response is unexpected.

512
00:48:54,340 --> 00:48:55,810
I don't want to go into solitary

513
00:48:55,810 --> 00:48:58,450
for being on the same page as you, that's all.

514
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:02,320
Right.

515
00:49:03,050 --> 00:49:05,660
This is new and I brought it here for a wash.

516
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:08,060
Take it into your solitary cell.

517
00:49:11,530 --> 00:49:13,530
-You're mocking me, right? -It's a solitary cell.

518
00:49:13,530 --> 00:49:16,630
You should go in there with a clean mind and body.

519
00:49:16,630 --> 00:49:17,800
Try them on.

520
00:49:19,270 --> 00:49:21,140
I have good personal hygiene.

521
00:49:22,340 --> 00:49:25,740
Hold on a second. Haven't you had those on for days?

522
00:49:25,740 --> 00:49:28,150
I have ten of the same design.

523
00:49:28,150 --> 00:49:30,610
As if.

524
00:49:30,650 --> 00:49:31,950
Now, go to the chief.

525
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:34,480
I will after I change.

526
00:50:03,150 --> 00:50:05,650
<i>Breaking news, Director Gu Won-bong</i>

527
00:50:05,650 --> 00:50:08,850
<i>who went missing from K Hospital turns out to be alive.</i>

528
00:50:09,090 --> 00:50:11,590
<i>Just a moment ago, we received a package</i>

529
00:50:11,590 --> 00:50:13,290
<i>from an anonymous sender.</i>

530
00:50:13,290 --> 00:50:15,590
<i>It contained a recorded video</i>

531
00:50:15,590 --> 00:50:17,560
<i>of Director Gu's crucial announcement.</i>

532
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:19,600
<i>What he has to say is quite shocking</i>

533
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:21,700
<i>and we will play it for you right this moment.</i>

534
00:50:22,770 --> 00:50:26,140
I sit here before you today to expose

535
00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:28,510
this nation's evil government and police force.

536
00:50:28,510 --> 00:50:31,340
Several years ago, under the pretext

537
00:50:31,340 --> 00:50:34,640
of eliminating The Red Ants before it became Argos,

538
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:37,510
a proposal was made to our lab

539
00:50:37,510 --> 00:50:40,520
regarding the creation of enhanced human weapons.

540
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:44,320
<i>K Hospital's research lab was a leading force</i>

541
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:46,520
<i>behind rehabilitation medicine</i>

542
00:50:46,790 --> 00:50:50,790
<i>and therefore clearly expressed its objection to using technology</i>

543
00:50:50,790 --> 00:50:53,760
<i>to create weapons that can take human lives.</i>

544
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:57,300
<i>However, the government and police pressured us</i>

545
00:50:57,530 --> 00:51:00,770
into joining the experiment with its threats and trickery.

546
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:05,740
We had no choice but to launch unethical human experimentation.

547
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:08,310
-Director Gu... -<i>However,</i>

548
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:11,880
<i>once we found out that the experiments</i>

549
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:14,890
<i>were to be made on the most vicious criminals,</i>

550
00:51:14,890 --> 00:51:16,620
<i>we took a strong stand and</i>

551
00:51:16,620 --> 00:51:20,220
-<i>the experiments were ceased.</i> -Chief. Why is Gi-beom's photo there?

552
00:51:21,060 --> 00:51:24,290
<i>The government and the police stressed social responsibility</i>

553
00:51:24,290 --> 00:51:27,330
-<i>and squashed our opinions.</i> -What the hell are we seeing?

554
00:51:27,330 --> 00:51:29,970
-He's the whistle-blower. -<i>Despite our achievements,</i>

555
00:51:29,970 --> 00:51:33,170
-<i>we were abandoned though.</i> -But they are all lies.

556
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:37,140
<i>All the researchers including myself were abducted and murdered.</i>

557
00:51:37,140 --> 00:51:38,680
That son of a bitch.

558
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:40,080
-He tried to kill us. -<i>The government</i>

559
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:44,580
<i>and police must acknowledge their unethical and illegal ways.</i>

560
00:51:44,710 --> 00:51:48,420
<i>I, Gu Won-bong, strongly urge them</i>

561
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:52,420
to genuinely apologize and generously compensate those

562
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:56,460
who were coerced into participating in this project.

563
00:51:57,560 --> 00:52:01,000
<i>No matter how many times you hear it,</i>

564
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,270
<i>the content is too shocking to believe.</i>

565
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:05,600
<i>However, there is something</i>

566
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:08,910
<i>that the viewers should be well aware of.</i>

567
00:52:08,910 --> 00:52:12,180
<i>This is only Director Gu's unilateral claim</i>

568
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:15,550
<i>and investigations must be conducted to verify his allegations.</i>

569
00:52:15,550 --> 00:52:17,580
-Hello? -<i>You son of a bitch.</i>

570
00:52:17,580 --> 00:52:19,780
Is this the best you can do?

571
00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:21,850
Do you want to see my head on a spike?

572
00:52:23,250 --> 00:52:25,320
You're done for.

573
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:34,130
Any more exposure will bring an end to Rugal.

574
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:35,570
Don't let this explode.

575
00:52:35,570 --> 00:52:38,030
I'll do whatever it takes.

576
00:52:38,030 --> 00:52:39,800
<i>With just your words?</i>

577
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:42,210
It's time to cut our losses.

578
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:44,310
Kang Gi-beom's the issue,

579
00:52:44,310 --> 00:52:46,880
so sever him from the operation.

580
00:52:47,210 --> 00:52:49,150
<i>Deal with what's urgent</i>

581
00:52:49,150 --> 00:52:51,010
<i>and I'll take it from there.</i>

582
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:10,270
We will try our best to check the facts

583
00:53:10,270 --> 00:53:13,240
to see what is true and what is not.

584
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:22,750
<i>Do you finally get it?</i>

585
00:53:23,050 --> 00:53:25,550
<i>Argos isn't a criminal enterprise.</i>

586
00:53:26,350 --> 00:53:29,620
<i>The true criminals of this nation are government officials</i>

587
00:53:29,620 --> 00:53:32,690
<i>and police officers living off our tax.</i>

588
00:53:32,690 --> 00:53:34,520
<i>They are our enemies.</i>

589
00:53:34,790 --> 00:53:36,530
<i>My fellow people,</i>

590
00:53:36,690 --> 00:53:38,200
<i>open your eyes.</i>

591
00:53:39,630 --> 00:53:41,530
<i>What they did was put on a show</i>

592
00:53:41,530 --> 00:53:43,370
<i>to create human weapons.</i>

593
00:53:43,370 --> 00:53:44,970
Fuck. Is this true?

594
00:53:44,970 --> 00:53:49,210
<i>They did so by pointing all the blame at Argos too.</i>

595
00:53:49,510 --> 00:53:51,840
<i>All the cold cases,</i>

596
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:55,310
<i>the missing people, and violent crimes</i>

597
00:53:55,310 --> 00:53:57,650
<i>were created by the leaders of this nation.</i>

598
00:53:57,650 --> 00:54:00,280
He can't just spit lies like this.

599
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:03,020
What's going on? Were we hacked?

600
00:54:03,020 --> 00:54:04,650
I can't pull down the video.

601
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:06,220
It seems recorded,

602
00:54:06,220 --> 00:54:07,520
but every network's server

603
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:09,130
has been breached as well.

604
00:54:10,230 --> 00:54:12,830
<i>The man at the center of this scheme...</i>

605
00:54:13,060 --> 00:54:16,230
<i>He will come out and reveal all the truth.</i>

606
00:54:16,230 --> 00:54:18,100
What if he refuses?

607
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,970
<i>All the tragedies</i>

608
00:54:20,970 --> 00:54:22,840
Argos was accused

609
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:25,410
of masterminding and executing

610
00:54:25,410 --> 00:54:30,050
will be reenacted by Argos in person.

611
00:54:32,050 --> 00:54:34,020
You hear me,

612
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:36,020
Kang Gi-beom?

613
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:39,990
Sure.

614
00:54:40,260 --> 00:54:42,830
I hear you loud and clear, Hwang Deuk-gu.

615
00:54:51,770 --> 00:54:53,140
<i>Kang is a killer and a fugitive.</i>

616
00:54:53,140 --> 00:54:54,870
<i>No one knows if he's dead or alive.</i>

617
00:54:54,870 --> 00:54:56,370
<i>Please get to the truth.</i>

618
00:54:56,370 --> 00:55:00,340
<i>If things go this way, we cannot be sure that we are able to live safely.</i>

619
00:55:00,340 --> 00:55:03,350
<i>We have a right to know if we're safe or not.</i>

620
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:09,790
Don't let this get to you personally, Gi-beom.

621
00:55:09,790 --> 00:55:12,360
We might be played by Hwang Deuk-gu.

622
00:55:12,590 --> 00:55:13,790
Over my dead body.

623
00:55:13,790 --> 00:55:15,830
We're to give Gi-beom up?

624
00:55:16,460 --> 00:55:18,730
That will never happen, so don't you worry.

625
00:55:18,730 --> 00:55:19,960
I have your back.

626
00:55:21,130 --> 00:55:23,130
Your sacrifice won't clear up this mess.

627
00:55:23,130 --> 00:55:24,430
He's right.

628
00:55:24,430 --> 00:55:27,300
Playing into his hands could destroy Rugal too.

629
00:55:27,540 --> 00:55:30,640
Hwang Deuk-gu's move isn't all that surprising though.

630
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:32,910
We all knew this would happen.

631
00:55:32,910 --> 00:55:34,810
He plastered my name on dead bodies.

632
00:55:34,810 --> 00:55:36,980
Of course, he'd go all the way.

633
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:40,550
But that got me thinking

634
00:55:41,150 --> 00:55:44,190
about what would happen if my identity were to be revealed.

635
00:55:45,590 --> 00:55:48,690
I believe my sacrifice will put an end to him.

636
00:55:48,930 --> 00:55:50,590
I am who Hwang Deuk-gu wants.

637
00:55:50,590 --> 00:55:52,430
You think he'll keep his promise?

638
00:55:52,430 --> 00:55:54,000
Hwang Deuk-gu of all people?

639
00:55:54,430 --> 00:55:56,230
I can make him.

640
00:55:56,230 --> 00:55:58,370
That won't be the end though.

641
00:55:58,370 --> 00:56:00,500
It'll be up to you to do the rest.

642
00:56:00,740 --> 00:56:02,170
Rugal will still have you three.

643
00:56:02,170 --> 00:56:03,640
Gi-beom...

644
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:05,440
What the hell are you saying?

645
00:56:06,510 --> 00:56:09,150
Do you know what's funny though?

646
00:56:09,850 --> 00:56:14,020
Although he looks like pure evil, the people are swayed by his words.

647
00:56:15,620 --> 00:56:18,050
We worked hard, didn't we?

648
00:56:19,020 --> 00:56:21,090
We fought through our injuries

649
00:56:21,090 --> 00:56:23,290
to protect those we don't even know.

650
00:56:24,460 --> 00:56:27,060
I didn't care about being acknowledged

651
00:56:27,530 --> 00:56:29,230
because I believed

652
00:56:29,530 --> 00:56:31,900
in what we were doing.

653
00:56:32,870 --> 00:56:34,070
But...

654
00:56:35,370 --> 00:56:37,110
I guess that wasn't it.

655
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:40,710
It's heartbreaking actually.

656
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:45,050
Our good intentions have been ignored,

657
00:56:46,550 --> 00:56:48,250
and it burns.

658
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:55,260
Do I really deserve to be this hated?

659
00:56:56,130 --> 00:56:58,330
What on earth did I do anyway?

660
00:57:06,870 --> 00:57:08,970
On the other hand, I'm just sorry.

661
00:57:11,540 --> 00:57:13,640
I'm sorry about everything

662
00:57:15,250 --> 00:57:17,610
and that guilt is hard to bear.

663
00:58:34,820 --> 00:58:38,460
-Are you sure it's a bomb? -It's homemade, but the maker is talented.

664
00:58:38,460 --> 00:58:41,330
Trying to dismantle the timer bomb without proper knowledge of it

665
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:42,930
will blow up the bus.

666
00:58:42,930 --> 00:58:45,800
If Gi-beom doesn't show up at the designated location by 9 a.m.,

667
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:47,600
he'll blow it up.

668
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:00,320
I'll go alone.

669
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:01,920
Go where?

670
00:59:03,490 --> 00:59:05,620
It's me he wants.

671
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:09,090
I want to stop being the cause

672
00:59:10,460 --> 00:59:12,560
of other people's pain.

673
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:15,200
Please let me do this.

674
00:59:33,420 --> 00:59:36,650
POLICE

675
00:59:36,650 --> 00:59:39,460
KANG GI-BEOM

676
01:00:36,710 --> 01:00:38,650
Tae-woong, move out of the way.

677
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:49,390
CLIENT

678
01:01:10,610 --> 01:01:12,920
KANG GI-BEOM

679
01:02:51,350 --> 01:02:53,280
<i>Is it really worth it</i>

680
01:02:53,720 --> 01:02:56,020
to protect the things you want?

681
01:02:56,020 --> 01:02:59,160
<i>You know you will all be fugitives if your team is dismissed.</i>

682
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:01,790
Don't get caught until you catch them all.

683
01:03:01,890 --> 01:03:03,930
<i>The ones who are worse than me</i>

684
01:03:04,390 --> 01:03:06,100
<i>are your higher-ups.</i>

685
01:03:07,730 --> 01:03:10,970
<i>Tell me the truth before I kill you all.</i>

686
01:03:11,370 --> 01:03:13,500
<i>You arrogant bastard.</i>

687
01:03:14,100 --> 01:03:16,710
<i>One of us has to die for it to end.</i>

688
01:03:17,010 --> 01:03:20,040
Goodbye, Kang Gi-beom.
