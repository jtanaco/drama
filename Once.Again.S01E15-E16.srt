1
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:10,136
<b>Put the ingredients in the fridge.</b>

2
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:11,330
<b>Okay.</b>

3
00:00:12,089 --> 00:00:13,356
<b>We're closed for...</b>

4
00:00:13,381 --> 00:00:14,381
<b>My goodness.</b>

5
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,429
<b>My gosh.
Aren't you the chicken lady?</b>

6
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,269
<b>What brings you all here?</b>

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,269
<b>Okay, so, the thing is...</b>

8
00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:32,550
<b>We're here to give you a warning.</b>

9
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:35,780
<b>A warning?</b>

10
00:00:44,189 --> 00:00:45,805
<b>(Episode 15)</b>

11
00:00:45,829 --> 00:00:49,259
<b>A warning?
I don't think I quite follow.</b>

12
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:53,100
<b>I've been...</b>

13
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,600
<b>watching you for a few days
after you opened your diner and...</b>

14
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,840
<b>Yes, I'm listening.</b>

15
00:00:59,869 --> 00:01:01,109
<b>Well...</b>

16
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:05,310
<b>The way you operate
your diner isn't...</b>

17
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:07,079
<b>It doesn't fit the market tradition.</b>

18
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:09,880
<b>It's tasteless to be exact.</b>

19
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,965
<b>What do you mean by "tasteless"?</b>

20
00:01:13,989 --> 00:01:15,620
<b>Let's start with the sign out front.</b>

21
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:19,266
<b>The drawing on it
is a bit hard to understand.</b>

22
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:23,299
<b>The sign out front?
It was for my previous business,</b>

23
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,370
<b>and it's practically brand new.</b>

24
00:01:25,569 --> 00:01:27,876
<b>It'll be a waste of money
to throw it away,</b>

25
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,415
<b>so I thought I'd make
good use of it.</b>

26
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:30,469
<b>Hold on.</b>

27
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:33,545
<b>Are you saying
you're going to keep using that?</b>

28
00:01:33,569 --> 00:01:34,980
<b>What else can we do?</b>

29
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:37,456
<b>New signs cost extra money...</b>

30
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:40,226
<b>and we spent every last penny
we had for buying this place.</b>

31
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:41,549
<b>We're broke.</b>

32
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:44,219
<b>It's not like you ladies
will pay for a new one.</b>

33
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:47,750
<b>Also, please refrain...</b>

34
00:01:47,989 --> 00:01:51,989
<b>from soliciting people out
on the street to come inside.</b>

35
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:55,859
<b>We don't know what sort of
business you previously ran,</b>

36
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:57,736
<b>but we don't do that here.</b>

37
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,945
<b>Why not?</b>

38
00:01:58,969 --> 00:02:02,146
<b>How can you run a business without
asking customers to come inside?</b>

39
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:04,045
<b>We live in an era of self-promotion.</b>

40
00:02:04,069 --> 00:02:07,346
<b>Only accepting customers
who walk in willingly...</b>

41
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:09,355
<b>- is too old-fashioned.
- Exactly.</b>

42
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:12,885
<b>It's nice that
you're taking initiative, but...</b>

43
00:02:12,909 --> 00:02:14,719
<b>- But then we're good, right?
- Right.</b>

44
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:16,120
<b>So what else?</b>

45
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:20,419
<b>Your clothes and hair!
That's what I hate the most.</b>

46
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:25,189
<b>Who shows skin like this
in a small diner?</b>

47
00:02:25,289 --> 00:02:27,536
<b>One might think you're a call girl.</b>

48
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,635
<b>Tell me about it.</b>

49
00:02:28,659 --> 00:02:30,336
<b>Who cares what you think?</b>

50
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,699
<b>Are you saying we're not allowed
to wear what we want?</b>

51
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:34,816
<b>Must those who run
a business at a market...</b>

52
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,515
<b>wear baggy pants of all colors
and have extra curly hair?</b>

53
00:02:38,539 --> 00:02:40,169
<b>It's like a uniform, if you ask me.</b>

54
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,756
<b>Fashion is all about
being satisfied with yourself.</b>

55
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:47,385
<b>It's not like
we're carrying around daggers,</b>

56
00:02:47,409 --> 00:02:50,550
<b>so I'd appreciate some level
of respect for our individuality.</b>

57
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:54,325
<b>While we're at it,
let me explain my makeup.</b>

58
00:02:54,349 --> 00:02:56,659
<b>Growing up in the woods
gave me so many freckles.</b>

59
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:59,265
<b>I would've given anything
to be born with...</b>

60
00:02:59,289 --> 00:03:01,235
<b>fair skin like yours,</b>

61
00:03:01,259 --> 00:03:03,099
<b>but all I can do is conceal it now.</b>

62
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,530
<b>I'm sure the sister understands.</b>

63
00:03:06,229 --> 00:03:07,545
<b>- What?
- So,</b>

64
00:03:07,569 --> 00:03:10,569
<b>did that answer your questions?
I tried my best, you know.</b>

65
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:14,816
<b>You're probably exhausted,
so go ahead and get some rest.</b>

66
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,586
<b>Gosh, look at the bags
under your eyes.</b>

67
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:18,250
<b>You must be exhausted.</b>

68
00:03:19,509 --> 00:03:22,195
<b>Then get home safely.</b>

69
00:03:22,219 --> 00:03:23,925
<b>- Girls, let's call it a day.
- Sure.</b>

70
00:03:23,949 --> 00:03:25,425
<b>- Mop the floor.
- Got it.</b>

71
00:03:25,449 --> 00:03:27,650
<b>- Mop the floor!
- What on earth?</b>

72
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,695
<b>Mop, mop.</b>

73
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:31,830
<b>My goodness.</b>

74
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:39,445
<b>My gosh.</b>

75
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:40,545
<b>Let's go.</b>

76
00:03:40,569 --> 00:03:42,340
<b>Can you believe it?</b>

77
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,846
<b>Gosh, look at the time.</b>

78
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:46,770
<b>I should close up.
See you tomorrow.</b>

79
00:03:46,969 --> 00:03:49,580
<b>I need to clean up too.
Bye, Ok Boon.</b>

80
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:52,250
<b>What now?</b>

81
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:54,825
<b>You dragged me here
and look what happened.</b>

82
00:03:54,849 --> 00:03:56,919
<b>What will they think of me now?</b>

83
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:00,590
<b>I'll never lead the pack again,
so don't you make me.</b>

84
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:05,090
<b>What on earth
are you blaming me for?</b>

85
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:11,199
<b>What has that woman been eating?</b>

86
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:13,000
<b>Never have I seen a woman...</b>

87
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:14,470
<b>that boisterous
and shameless before.</b>

88
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,870
<b>No, sir.
Saying that won't persuade us.</b>

89
00:04:21,009 --> 00:04:24,439
<b>We're not going on TV.
We won't change our minds.</b>

90
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:31,726
<b>Gosh, what's this smell?</b>

91
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,526
<b>The stew must be burning.</b>

92
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:36,889
<b>Sir, I'll call you back.
I'm terribly sorry!</b>

93
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,605
<b>No, sir. That's not it.</b>

94
00:04:44,629 --> 00:04:47,199
<b>It's not because
you did anything wrong.</b>

95
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,076
<b>No, it's just that we're...</b>

96
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,540
<b>That's not it.</b>

97
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:57,716
<b>Wait, what's that smell?</b>

98
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:00,386
<b>I mean sound?
I think I'm hearing something.</b>

99
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:02,326
<b>Someone must be at the door.</b>

100
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:04,019
<b>I'll call you back.
I'm terribly sorry.</b>

101
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,990
<b>I thought my ears
were going to melt.</b>

102
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:11,706
<b>He's been calling us back and forth
for hours now.</b>

103
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:13,735
<b>Why won't he give up already?</b>

104
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:16,660
<b>Tell me about it.
The man sure can whine.</b>

105
00:05:17,529 --> 00:05:20,076
<b>It doesn't seem like
he'll give up easily. Now what?</b>

106
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,446
<b>What else can we do?</b>

107
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:23,446
<b>It's not like we can
actually go on TV.</b>

108
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:25,209
<b>That's not what I meant.</b>

109
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,069
<b>Why don't we...</b>

110
00:05:27,709 --> 00:05:30,110
<b>just tell the director our status?</b>

111
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:31,550
<b>Are you serious?</b>

112
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:34,656
<b>Have you forgotten
that he's close to your mother?</b>

113
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,096
<b>This isn't at all like
keeping your brother's secret.</b>

114
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,795
<b>Who do you think
the director is closer to?</b>

115
00:05:39,819 --> 00:05:41,389
<b>Us or your mother?</b>

116
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:47,160
<b>The show is next week,
so let's hold him off until then.</b>

117
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,976
<b>I'm sure they'll look
for a substitute shortly.</b>

118
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,100
<b>I can't believe the stress.</b>

119
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:55,740
<b>The stew has completely boiled down.
How am I supposed to eat this?</b>

120
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:58,970
<b>But I saw you eat earlier today.</b>

121
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:00,410
<b>You want more?</b>

122
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:05,726
<b>Well, Si Hoo didn't like
the hospital food,</b>

123
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,030
<b>so she packed some food for him.</b>

124
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:09,620
<b>She packed too much
and asked me to finish it off.</b>

125
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:12,389
<b>But I was interrupted
by the director's call.</b>

126
00:06:12,949 --> 00:06:15,636
<b>One might think of you
as the husband.</b>

127
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:19,365
<b>Don't be ridiculous.
Don't let Si Hoo's father hear that.</b>

128
00:06:19,389 --> 00:06:20,565
<b>Si Hoo's father?</b>

129
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:21,759
<b>You see,</b>

130
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:26,076
<b>she's always been the type
to be generous to those around her.</b>

131
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,216
<b>When she was in the choir,
she used to pack...</b>

132
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,615
<b>- sandwiches for everyone...
- Who cares?</b>

133
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,240
<b>Yes, exactly.</b>

134
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:35,310
<b>I don't even know
why I'm explaining myself to you.</b>

135
00:06:42,779 --> 00:06:45,226
<b>So I'll officially start
my promotions today.</b>

136
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,425
<b>With running a business,
half of it is getting started,</b>

137
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:49,096
<b>and the other half is promotions.</b>

138
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,966
<b>I'll send out
my business cards today and...</b>

139
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:54,660
<b>Look at you,
talking like a true businessman now.</b>

140
00:06:54,829 --> 00:06:55,976
<b>I'm amazed.</b>

141
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,629
<b>Da Hee, I'm grateful and all,</b>

142
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,846
<b>but I'd rather you call me a CEO
than a businessman.</b>

143
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:05,886
<b>Shouldn't you put on a suit to
make yourself look more presentable?</b>

144
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:07,446
<b>Something casual
would probably be better.</b>

145
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:09,456
<b>Wearing a suit
makes me look like a thug.</b>

146
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:12,555
<b>My gosh. Who said that?
Which scumbag said that to you?</b>

147
00:07:12,579 --> 00:07:13,680
<b>Hyun Gyung.</b>

148
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:16,279
<b>That's what you listen to?</b>

149
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:18,196
<b>Hyun Gyung is someone
he always listens to.</b>

150
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:20,180
<b>It's why he divorced her so easily
when she asked.</b>

151
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,906
<b>Do you want my help

<b>Save it, old lady,

154

<b>Old lady?</b>

155
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:35,069
<b>Are you kidding me?
No one calls me old on the streets.</b>

156
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:37,839
<b>Son, do I look old to you?</b>

157
00:07:38,439 --> 00:07:40,016
<b>No, you're beautiful.</b>

158
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,110
<b>Right? I am, right?</b>

159
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:45,810
<b>My son sure has good taste,

160
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:49,120
<b>This is why brainwashing
can be dangerous.</b>

161
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:51,055
<b>Gosh, I almost forgot. Mom,</b>

162
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:54,295
<b>did you leave this and a plant
outside my office?</b>

163

<b>No, I don't even know where it is.</b>

164

<b>Well, the address
is on the business card so...</b>

165
00:07:59,529 --> 00:08:00,860
<b>Was it either of you then?</b>

166
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:02,759
<b>- No.
- It wasn't me either.</b>

167

I would've announced myself.</b>

00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:07,730
<b>You're right. Then who...</b>

169
00:08:09,699 --> 00:08:11,076
<b>No way. That's impossible.</b>

170
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:13,315
<b>I must be crazy to think that.</b>

171

<b>What are you mumbling on your own?</b>

172

<b>Stop yapping and eat up.</b>

173

177
00:08:38,259 --> 00:08:40,830
<b>No way. When did I spend that much?</b>

178
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,840
<b>That's right. The restaurant!</b>

179

183

<b>Does she think

196
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:29,696
<b>Exactly!</b>

197
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,395
<b>There's no need

198

<b>They're part of the family now,

<b>She can work alone

204

<b>Why bother joining

205
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:50,846
<b>Lower your voice.
There's no need to take the lead.</b>

<b>Guys, come on.</b>

207

<b>It's not like I particularly want

208

<b>without joining the association.</b>

210
00:10:01,779 --> 00:10:04,296

<b>to ostracize people anyway.</b>

214

<b>about the merchants here

216

217

<b>Keep the peace yourself,

218
00:10:20,269 --> 00:10:22,570
<b>If we must do this,

<b>If they agree...</b>

220

<b>to follow our rules and cooperate,</b>

221

222
00:10:28,539 --> 00:10:30,615
<b>That's right.
They should make a promise.</b>

223

<b>Yes, they should.</b>

224

<b>What? On one condition?</b>

225
00:10:40,019 --> 00:10:41,326
<b>Just forget about it.</b>

226
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:44,196
<b>We'd rather not get involved

232

<b>They won't let us join if we don't.</b>

233
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,186
<b>What a dirty move.</b>

234
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:00,885
<b>Who gave them the right
to push us around?</b>

235
00:11:00,909 --> 00:11:01,985
<b>This is ridiculous.</b>

236
00:11:02,009 --> 00:11:04,515
<b>I guess they found out

237

<b>That's why they are

<b>no human is above a human,

<b>Who's calling who vulgar?</b>

241
00:11:13,549 --> 00:11:16,035
<b>Forget it, Cho Yeon.
Just ignore them.</b>

242
00:11:16,059 --> 00:11:17,635
<b>Right. Just forget about them.</b>

243
00:11:17,659 --> 00:11:20,360
<b>Gosh, I just want to fight them.</b>

244
00:11:21,159 --> 00:11:24,029
<b>If they keep being like this,
I'll just have it out with them.</b>

245

<b>What did she say?
Did she say she wouldn't accept it?</b>

246
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,440
<b>She said she doesn't need it.
She just hung up on me.</b>

<b>My gosh. She's unbelievable.</b>

248

<b>My goodness.
She just hung up on you?</b>

249

<b>I knew she was something,</b>

250

<b>but she's stronger than I thought.</b>

251
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:47,395
<b>She wants to run a business here...</b>

252

<b>without joining
the merchant association?</b>

253

<b>I guess she doesn't know anything.</b>

254

<b>She's so stubborn.</b>

255

<b>We didn't threaten her.

<b>Why are you yelling at me?</b>

260

<b>Gosh, when did I do that?</b>

262

<b>It's not that I was scared.</b>

263
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:13,809

304
00:14:28,149 --> 00:14:29,149
<b>What?</b>

305
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:31,879
<b>I will get back as much as I invest?</b>

306
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:35,289
<b>What nonsense.
Do you think I'm getting it back?</b>

307
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:37,820
<b>You can't do this to me.</b>

308
00:14:44,529 --> 00:14:46,206
<b>So the president called her.</b>

309
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:48,070
<b>Do you know what she said?</b>

310
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:52,440
<b>She said, "I don't need
the merchant association."</b>

311
00:14:52,669 --> 00:14:54,046
<b>"I know how to get things done."</b>

312
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:57,785
<b>"I will show you
disregard and disrespect."</b>

313
00:14:57,809 --> 00:14:59,556
<b>She practically wants a fight.</b>

314
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:01,086
<b>My goodness.
Did she really say that?</b>

315
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:02,620
<b>Of course, she did.</b>

316
00:15:03,419 --> 00:15:04,655
<b>That's what I heard.</b>

317
00:15:04,679 --> 00:15:06,450
<b>I don't make things up.</b>

318
00:15:06,889 --> 00:15:08,919
<b>Has she lost her mind or what?</b>

319
00:15:09,059 --> 00:15:11,696
<b>I don't care what she's up to.</b>

320
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:15,905
<b>I used to be quite notorious
in Wangsimni back in the days.</b>

321
00:15:15,929 --> 00:15:18,129
<b>- Just bring it on.
- I know.</b>

322
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:21,269
<b>Hello there.</b>

323
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:24,100
<b>- You're early today.
- Hello.</b>

324
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,216
<b>Look at your clothes.</b>

325
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,440
<b>Those are huge flowers.
You look great.</b>

326
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,556
<b>- Have a nice day.
- Have a nice day.</b>

327
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:34,080
<b>Have a nice day.</b>

328
00:15:39,019 --> 00:15:40,720
<b>They are smiling.</b>

329
00:15:42,789 --> 00:15:45,066
<b>They just made fun of us, right?</b>

330
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:46,090
<b>- Yes.
- Sure.</b>

331
00:15:47,129 --> 00:15:48,860
<b>I can't believe this.</b>

332
00:15:49,259 --> 00:15:50,259
<b>Darn it.</b>

333
00:15:55,669 --> 00:15:58,716
<b>Did you just see their faces?
They look brutal.</b>

334
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,385
<b>I was so intimidated.</b>

335
00:16:00,409 --> 00:16:02,485
<b>They are quite scary
when they're together.</b>

336
00:16:02,509 --> 00:16:03,879
<b>Don't be intimidated.</b>

337
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:06,285
<b>A fight is all about spirit.</b>

338
00:16:06,309 --> 00:16:08,480
<b>Once you lose your nerve,
the fight is over.</b>

339
00:16:08,679 --> 00:16:11,655
<b>We should treat them with a smile
at a time like this. You know?</b>

340
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:13,389
<b>Okay. I get it.</b>

341
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,860
<b>Fine. We're experts in smiling.</b>

342
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:19,490
<b>By the way, those petty things are
just getting on my nerves.</b>

343
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:23,059
<b>The woman with the tiny eyes.
She keeps acting up.</b>

344
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:25,159
<b>She's so annoying.</b>

345
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:27,870
<b>Hello. I'm from Good Action Company.</b>

346
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,976
<b>We can hit, get hit,
or rise from the dead.</b>

347
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,275
<b>We can do just about anything.</b>

348
00:16:31,299 --> 00:16:32,809
<b>Please call us. Thank you.</b>

349
00:16:33,669 --> 00:16:35,940
<b>Producer Choi, do you remember me?</b>

350
00:16:36,139 --> 00:16:38,580
<b>I was the stand-in for Lee Seo Jin.</b>

351
00:16:38,809 --> 00:16:40,525
<b>I heard you're starting
a historical drama.</b>

352
00:16:40,549 --> 00:16:42,326
<b>My guys look
like prisoners of war...</b>

353
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:43,750
<b>even without makeup.</b>

354
00:16:43,879 --> 00:16:46,125
<b>If you hire two people,
we can send you an extra.</b>

355
00:16:46,149 --> 00:16:48,389
<b>Buy 2, get 1 free.
Isn't it a good deal?</b>

356
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:50,120
<b>Please call us.</b>

357
00:16:50,419 --> 00:16:52,289
<b>Good Action Company. Thank you.</b>

358
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:53,806
<b>Hello, sir.</b>

359
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:55,936
<b>Why are you carrying a heavy box?
You might hurt your back.</b>

360
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,460
<b>- Hello.
- You know who I am.</b>

361
00:16:57,659 --> 00:16:59,269
<b>It's Good Action Company.</b>

362
00:17:02,029 --> 00:17:04,769
<b>Gosh. I was so afraid
the toilet would be clogged again.</b>

363
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:07,009
<b>What are you doing?</b>

364
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,539
<b>Are you a larva? Just get up.</b>

365
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:12,250
<b>I'm so cold.</b>

366
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:14,809
<b>I have aches and pains
all over my body.</b>

367
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:17,420
<b>Really? I feel the same way.</b>

368
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:20,220
<b>I feel itchy all over.
Come on and scratch my back.</b>

369
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:23,789
<b>Is it because the room is moldy?</b>

370
00:17:24,789 --> 00:17:26,089
<b>Did you see the ceiling?</b>

371
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,400
<b>When I lived alone,</b>

372
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:30,960
<b>I saw the map of Korea
on the ceiling.</b>

373
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,575
<b>But this is my first time to see
the map of the world.</b>

374
00:17:32,599 --> 00:17:34,269
<b>If it's that bad up there,</b>

375
00:17:34,299 --> 00:17:36,740
<b>it means the walls and floors
are all rotten.</b>

376
00:17:36,769 --> 00:17:38,440
<b>Can't we just go back to a sauna?</b>

377
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:40,386
<b>At least the floor is warm there.</b>

378
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:41,670
<b>No, we can't.</b>

379
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:43,539
<b>Did you not see
Joon Seon feeling so happy?</b>

380
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,750
<b>And what about the money?</b>

381
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:48,880
<b>What are you doing?</b>

382
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:50,825
<b>- You're here.
- Hello.</b>

383
00:17:50,849 --> 00:17:52,150
<b>Hey, did you sleep well?</b>

384
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:53,696
<b>How was it?
Did you get some good sleep?</b>

385
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:56,396
<b>- It was like paradise.
- It's so comfortable.</b>

386
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:57,460
<b>Really?</b>

387
00:17:57,619 --> 00:18:00,059
<b>I guess this place suits you well.
That's nice.</b>

388
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:01,835
<b>Let's eat before we practice.</b>

389
00:18:01,859 --> 00:18:03,436
<b>Put these away.
I'll go cook noodles.</b>

390
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:04,529
<b>Okay.</b>

391
00:18:09,269 --> 00:18:12,515
<b>(Sort out your recyclables.)</b>

392
00:18:12,539 --> 00:18:13,985
<b>Stop.</b>

393
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:16,039
<b>(Please separate your garbage.)</b>

394
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:18,210
<b>How are you?</b>

395
00:18:20,509 --> 00:18:23,079
<b>How I'm doing is not your business.</b>

396
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:26,549
<b>You're not supposed to dump
your garbage here.</b>

397
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:29,735
<b>I heard this is where merchants
take out the garbage.</b>

398
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:32,789
<b>It's for the members
of the merchant association.</b>

399
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:36,099
<b>You're not a member.</b>

400
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,799
<b>Then where should we throw out
our garbage?</b>

401
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:41,845
<b>- Come again.
- Thank you.</b>

402
00:18:41,869 --> 00:18:44,045
<b>You left your food.
I'll pack it for you.</b>

403
00:18:44,069 --> 00:18:45,845
<b>- No.
- It's okay.</b>

404
00:18:45,869 --> 00:18:47,039
<b>- I'm full.
- It's okay.</b>

405
00:18:47,539 --> 00:18:49,579
<b>Come again. Study hard.</b>

406
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:53,609
<b>People in this neighborhood
have small appetites.</b>

407
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,220
<b>Hey.</b>

408
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:02,065
<b>Are you loafing around
and avoiding doing the dishes?</b>

409
00:19:02,089 --> 00:19:03,335
<b>No.</b>

410
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:05,390
<b>I had to go all the way
outside the market...</b>

411
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:06,490
<b>to dump the garbage.</b>

412
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:08,706
<b>The disposal site over here is for
members of the merchant association.</b>

413
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:11,406
<b>So we're not supposed
to use the place.</b>

414
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:13,369
<b>- What?
- Cho Yeon.</b>

415
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:17,269
<b>The merchant association wouldn't
let us cash in gift cards.</b>

416
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,245
<b>It's only for the members.</b>

417
00:19:19,269 --> 00:19:20,946
<b>- What should we do with these?
- Hang on.</b>

418
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:23,916
<b>We get a lot of gift cards.
What do we do?</b>

419
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:25,779
<b>Gosh, this is unbelievable.</b>

420
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:29,250
<b>Give me that. This is ridiculous.</b>

421
00:19:30,619 --> 00:19:31,596
<b>Take this.</b>

422
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:34,495
<b>I told you.
That's not within my authority.</b>

423
00:19:34,519 --> 00:19:36,295
<b>Then who's in charge?</b>

424
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:39,160
<b>It's fine that we can't use
the disposal site.</b>

425
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:41,329
<b>We can walk all the way
for exercise.</b>

426
00:19:41,789 --> 00:19:44,735
<b>But we're running the business
in the market.</b>

427
00:19:44,759 --> 00:19:47,569
<b>It's just unfair that we can't
cash in the gift cards.</b>

428
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:50,500
<b>It's like you don't want us
to run a business in the market.</b>

429
00:19:50,599 --> 00:19:52,809
<b>I understand. I really do.</b>

430
00:19:53,539 --> 00:19:57,515
<b>But it's the association that issues
and manages the gift cards.</b>

431
00:19:57,539 --> 00:19:59,285
<b>There's nothing I can do.</b>

432
00:19:59,309 --> 00:20:02,420
<b>Gosh, this is ridiculous.</b>

433
00:20:02,619 --> 00:20:05,180
<b>Gosh, it's so hot.</b>

434
00:20:05,349 --> 00:20:08,019
<b>Now that you're here,
let me tell you something.</b>

435
00:20:08,349 --> 00:20:10,819
<b>Why don't you just give in
and join the association?</b>

436
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:14,859
<b>You can't run a business in a market
without winning over the women.</b>

437
00:20:15,259 --> 00:20:16,976
<b>You should look further ahead.</b>

438
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,176
<b>It's so touching.</b>

439
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,869
<b>You're just playing the hypocrite.</b>

440
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:24,170
<b>Holding out like that wouldn't work.</b>

441
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:26,485
<b>We're having
the regular disinfection today.</b>

442
00:20:26,509 --> 00:20:28,640
<b>If you keep being like this,
you can't be part of it.</b>

443
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:31,410
<b>- Are you okay with that?
- Are you threatening me now?</b>

444
00:20:32,009 --> 00:20:33,549
<b>I'm not threatening you.</b>

445
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,386
<b>If you give way a little,</b>

446
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:38,180
<b>I can arbitrate between you two.</b>

447
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:41,025
<b>The women in the market
aren't that bad.</b>

448
00:20:41,049 --> 00:20:43,660
<b>They just lost their temper,
but they don't hold grudges.</b>

449
00:20:44,259 --> 00:20:46,406
<b>- So if you...
- Apparently, in the colonial era,</b>

450
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:50,059
<b>the Japanese exchanged
awards of honor amongst themselves.</b>

451
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:53,446
<b>- What did you say?
- The bottom line is...</b>

452
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:55,940
<b>that I can't cash
these gift cards in.</b>

453
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:59,269

<b>Or we tell the hospital director

<b>The director can't keep a secret.</b>

480

00:28:29,619 --> 00:28:32,559
<b>- Dad!
- My dear girl!</b>

609
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:36,005
<b>Why are you so late?
I waited for you.</b>

610
00:28:36,029 --> 00:28:37,500
<b>Dad was a bit busy.</b>

611
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,769
<b>Hi, Seo Jin.</b>

612
00:28:41,599 --> 00:28:42,845
<b>What did you do?</b>

613
00:28:42,869 --> 00:28:45,240
<b>Did you have business meetings
or something?</b>

614
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:47,940
<b>Well, something like that.</b>

615
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,015
<b>CEO Song, good for you!</b>

616
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:52,950
<b>Good for you too!</b>

617
00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:56,349
<b>Seo Young, get in the car.
I'm tired.</b>

618
00:28:57,049 --> 00:28:58,226
<b>Okay.</b>

619
00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:00,095
<b>I have to go. Make lots of money.</b>

620
00:29:00,119 --> 00:29:01,119
<b>I will.</b>

621
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:07,010
<b>There's an interview for
Seo Jin's kindergarten next month.</b>

622
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:10,000
<b>It was hard to find an opening
at a special needs center.</b>

623
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,876
<b>They want to see both parents.</b>

624
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:15,000
<b>Okay. Tell me when you have a date.</b>

625
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:16,240
<b>Hyun Gyung.</b>

626
00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:19,476
<b>Did you leave a potted plant...</b>

627
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,785
<b>and business card case
outside my office?</b>

628
00:29:21,809 --> 00:29:24,210
<b>No. Why would I go there?</b>

629
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:26,039
<b>See you.</b>

630
00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:29,079
<b>Yes. You'd never visit.</b>

631
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:30,579
<b>Then who was it?</b>

632
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:41,190
<b>It must be nice for you.</b>

633
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:44,400
<b>You stay the same and never age.</b>

634
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:49,069
<b>Do you know what day it is tomorrow?</b>

635
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:52,470
<b>It's the 35th anniversary
of the day we met.</b>

636
00:29:53,869 --> 00:29:57,740
<b>I can't forget the look on your face
when you fell in love with me.</b>

637
00:30:00,650 --> 00:30:03,250
<b>- I'm home, Mom.
- Welcome home.</b>

638
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,426
<b>Let's eat. I'm hungry.</b>

639
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:08,519
<b>I already ate. You haven't?</b>

640
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:12,235
<b>Can't you just pretend
I'm not around...</b>

641
00:30:12,259 --> 00:30:15,466
<b>and eat when you're hungry
and sleep when you're sleepy?</b>

642
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:17,876
<b>How can I pretend
you're not around when you are?</b>

643
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:20,630
<b>Okay, fine. I apologize. I'm sorry.</b>

644
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:22,545
<b>Come home early tomorrow.</b>

645
00:30:22,569 --> 00:30:24,799
<b>I don't want to eat alone, okay?</b>

646
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,809
<b>Okay, I'll do as you wish, Mother.</b>

647
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:30,309
<b>He's so cold-hearted.</b>

648
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:33,710
<b>He's even worse than Gyu Jin.</b>

649
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:50,900
<b>I know it's harder for you
to tell than me.</b>

650
00:30:53,529 --> 00:30:56,940
<b>Yes. The shock would be immense
for your mother.</b>

651
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,339
<b>But still,</b>

652
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:03,240
<b>we have to go through this
once someday.</b>

653
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,609
<b>Think about it carefully.</b>

654
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:27,569
<b>Na Hee, hi. This is out of the blue.</b>

655
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,700
<b>- Is something up?
- Of course not.</b>

656
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:33,809
<b>You probably have to go
to work today, right?</b>

657
00:31:34,539 --> 00:31:35,745
<b>Of course.</b>

658
00:31:35,769 --> 00:31:38,039
<b>What else should I do
when frying chicken is my job?</b>

659
00:31:39,509 --> 00:31:41,710
<b>How about you tell Dad
you're taking the day off...</b>

660
00:31:42,109 --> 00:31:43,480
<b>and go on a date with me?</b>

661
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:45,920
<b>Today? Just the two of us?</b>

662
00:31:46,549 --> 00:31:48,349
<b>Yes, just the two of us.</b>

663
00:31:50,089 --> 00:31:52,390
<b>My heart just skipped a beat,
you know.</b>

664
00:31:52,519 --> 00:31:54,130
<b>I'm excited just to think about it.</b>

665
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:58,160
<b>Okay, fine. I'll get that day off
if it's the last thing I do.</b>

666
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,269
<b>Sure. Hold on. I'll call you back.</b>

667
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:01,775
<b>- Honey!
- Yes?</b>

668
00:32:01,799 --> 00:32:03,646
<b>- Honey, hold on.
- What is it?</b>

669
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:06,269
<b>Let me take the day off today.</b>

670
00:32:06,539 --> 00:32:08,686
<b>It's Na Hee's day off too...</b>

671
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:10,085
<b>and she asked me out today.</b>

672
00:32:10,109 --> 00:32:12,555
<b>Na Hee? That's not like her at all.</b>

673
00:32:12,579 --> 00:32:15,809
<b>Who cares
if this is like her or not?</b>

674
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:17,926
<b>My husband never takes me anywhere,</b>

675
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:19,765
<b>so it'd be nice
to go on a date with her.</b>

676
00:32:19,789 --> 00:32:21,490
<b>I'm taking the day off, okay?</b>

677
00:32:21,890 --> 00:32:23,436
<b>Wait. What should I wear?</b>

678
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:24,696
<b>My dress is at the cleaners.</b>

679
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,160
<b>What else do I have?</b>

680
00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:29,065
<b>Look at her all excited.</b>

681
00:32:29,089 --> 00:32:31,529
<b>What's so good about going out
when all you do is spend money?</b>

682
00:32:34,099 --> 00:32:36,069
<b>Anyway, don't they know
what time it is?</b>

683
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,799
<b>Loafers, wake up!</b>

684
00:32:45,809 --> 00:32:46,910
<b>Where did it go?</b>

685
00:32:47,809 --> 00:32:49,169
<b>This is definitely where I parked.</b>

686
00:32:54,349 --> 00:32:55,366
<b>(From Na Hee)</b>

687
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:57,690
<b>I took the car to see my mom.</b>

688

<b>(Unnie's Kimbap)</b>

689
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:04,005
<b>It's as if the disinfectant...</b>

690
00:33:04,029 --> 00:33:06,136
<b>washed away all my troubles too.</b>

691
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,299
<b>Tell me about it.</b>

692
00:33:07,599 --> 00:33:10,416
<b>I haven't seen Ok Boon
all day today.</b>

693
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,599
<b>Did she go somewhere?</b>

694
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:13,386
<b>She took the day off...</b>

695
00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:15,010
<b>to go on a date
with her second daughter.</b>

696
00:33:15,539 --> 00:33:17,480
<b>- The doctor, right?
- Yes.</b>

697
00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:20,356
<b>She's as cold as dry ice,</b>

698
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:21,980
<b>but I guess she's warm
toward her mother.</b>

<b>(Unnie's Kimbap)</b>

700

<b>This coffee sure is delicious.</b>

701
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,835
<b>Sharing cups of coffee like this
among the people...</b>

702
00:33:37,859 --> 00:33:40,406
<b>is the beauty of working together
in the market, right?</b>

703
00:33:40,430 --> 00:33:42,930
<b>Yes, of course!</b>

704
00:33:43,539 --> 00:33:47,240
<b>It's sweeter than usual too.
Did someone add in honey?</b>

705

<b>Who does she think she is
glaring at us like that?</b>

<b>How dare she.</b>

707

<b>Why doesn't she join
the association then?</b>

708

<b>Look at all this dust.</b>

709
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:09,789
<b>Gosh, the dust.</b>

710
00:34:10,059 --> 00:34:12,259
<b>Let me dust this off.</b>

711
00:34:19,099 --> 00:34:20,110
<b>Unbelievable.</b>

00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:23,856
<b>They're not just annoying

<b>What's wrong?

<b>Make it strong

<b>Instant coffee?</b>

<b>I'm craving something sweet,

<b>Are pretty ones

<b>Bugs...</b>

<b>Yes, is there someone

<b>for his galbi restaurant

<b>Tomorrow if you like.

<b>I bet you talked smack

<b>when they're normally

<b>Well, you've done enough.</b>

<b>You should now
persuade the ladies...</b>

<b>into allowing the kimbap place

<b>Why should we?</b>

<b>They should be the ones

<b>They just don't seem

<b>to back down from a fight,

<b>Please...</b>

758
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:22,559
<b>It was terrifying.</b>

759
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:27,130
<b>My gosh.</b>

760
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:34,830
<b>(Episode 16)</b>

761
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:38,976
<b>I tried doing something
fancy to my hair,</b>

762
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,570
<b>but I don't think I did a good job.</b>

763
00:36:41,669 --> 00:36:44,070
<b>Maybe I should've
stopped by the salon.</b>

764
00:36:44,429 --> 00:36:47,140
<b>You're beautiful, Ms. Jang.</b>

765
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:50,309
<b>So what's gotten into you today?</b>

766
00:36:50,739 --> 00:36:53,386
<b>Did something happen at work?</b>

767
00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:55,350
<b>Like what exactly?</b>

768
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:58,679
<b>I just wanted to get
something nice to eat with you...</b>

769
00:36:58,850 --> 00:37:00,719
<b>and talk about a few things.</b>

770
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:05,590
<b>Gyu Jin will be uncomfortable
without his car today though.</b>

771
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:08,506
<b>I'm sure he took a cab.
He'll be fine for a day.</b>

772
00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:11,130
<b>That's not true for someone
who drives every day.</b>

773
00:37:11,259 --> 00:37:13,106
<b>This is why
you should've bought a car too.</b>

774
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:16,246
<b>No way. It won't be good
for my already bad temper.</b>

775
00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:19,176
<b>You say that like
there's a problem with you.</b>

776
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,875
<b>I hate when people
don't follow the rules...</b>

777
00:37:20,899 --> 00:37:23,770
<b>and I step on the brakes
when I get too angry...</b>

778
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:27,780
<b>He didn't even signal,
that son of a gun.</b>

779
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:33,020
<b>I get it now.
Let's only have Gyu Jin drive.</b>

780
00:37:47,859 --> 00:37:48,900
<b>What?</b>

781
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:04,849
<b>Wasn't that hilarious?</b>

782
00:38:06,879 --> 00:38:09,390
<b>Gosh this is so pretty.</b>

783
00:38:09,989 --> 00:38:11,620
<b>- Look at the seagull.
- Where?</b>

784
00:38:14,890 --> 00:38:15,930
<b>This is amazing.</b>

785
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:17,805
<b>- It is.
- How nice.</b>

786
00:38:17,829 --> 00:38:19,349
<b>I haven't been to the beach
in a while.</b>

787
00:38:20,099 --> 00:38:21,176
<b>I'll walk over there.</b>

788
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,700
<b>Sure. Mom, watch your step, okay?</b>

789
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:33,540
<b>Na Hee!</b>

790
00:39:00,939 --> 00:39:01,945
<b>Gosh, it's good.</b>

791
00:39:01,969 --> 00:39:04,370
<b>After all that fuss,
this is where you wanted to come?</b>

792
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:05,840
<b>This acorn jelly place?</b>

793
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,780
<b>I didn't know a better restaurant.</b>

794
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,620
<b>The story is the same
for when I dated your father.</b>

795
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:14,889
<b>All we did was eat buns
at a local bakery.</b>

796
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:17,250
<b>This is the one special place
we came to on a date.</b>

797
00:39:17,449 --> 00:39:18,695
<b>We were on our way back...</b>

798
00:39:18,719 --> 00:39:20,990
<b>from telling my parents
that we were getting married.</b>

799
00:39:23,759 --> 00:39:26,259
<b>Have you ever regretted...</b>

800
00:39:27,229 --> 00:39:28,870
<b>your life with Dad?</b>

801
00:39:30,069 --> 00:39:32,699
<b>Of course I have.
More than a hundred times.</b>

802
00:39:33,639 --> 00:39:36,110
<b>Still, the man grew on me.</b>

803
00:39:36,639 --> 00:39:39,186
<b>And thanks to marrying your father,</b>

804
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:40,955
<b>I was able to give birth...</b>

805
00:39:40,979 --> 00:39:42,610
<b>to such a sweet
and devoted daughter.</b>

806
00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:45,096
<b>Gosh, Mom.
I haven't done much for you.</b>

807
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:47,355
<b>This is more than enough!</b>

808
00:39:47,379 --> 00:39:49,889
<b>I feel like I'm on cloud nine,
you know.</b>

809
00:39:50,949 --> 00:39:53,620
<b>Then enjoy the dish.
I'll take you out more often.</b>

810
00:39:53,789 --> 00:39:55,060
<b>Actually,</b>

811
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:57,789
<b>once a year would
be more than enough.</b>

812
00:39:57,889 --> 00:39:59,800
<b>It'll definitely
give me some air to breathe.</b>

813
00:40:06,199 --> 00:40:08,216
<b>So, Mom...</b>

814
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,240
<b>Hold on a second.</b>

815
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:12,379
<b>Doesn't Gyu Jin love acorn jelly?</b>

816
00:40:12,909 --> 00:40:16,150
<b>He gobbled it down
the last time I made it for him.</b>

817
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:17,780
<b>I guess...</b>

818
00:40:18,379 --> 00:40:20,026
<b>Wait a second.</b>

819
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:21,425
<b>- Ma'am.
- Yes?</b>

820
00:40:21,449 --> 00:40:24,365
<b>Can we get a bowl
of acorn jelly salad to go?</b>

821
00:40:24,389 --> 00:40:26,036
<b>Mom, there's no need for that.</b>

822
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:28,389
<b>Take it home for Gyu Jin.</b>

823
00:40:28,830 --> 00:40:31,365
<b>He seemed gaunt the other day...</b>

824
00:40:31,389 --> 00:40:33,460
<b>which has been horrible
for his handsome face.</b>

825
00:40:33,930 --> 00:40:36,276
<b>Is it because you don't
cook for him often?</b>

826
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:37,729
<b>I was embarrassed, you know.</b>

827
00:40:38,599 --> 00:40:40,439
<b>He eats fine, Mom.</b>

828
00:40:40,699 --> 00:40:43,385
<b>He only seems gaunt
because work has been stressful.</b>

829
00:40:43,409 --> 00:40:47,039
<b>I'm just saying that
you should be more attentive.</b>

830
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:54,350
<b>Gosh, Gyu Jin would love this.</b>

831
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:57,050
<b>He enjoys everything he eats,
doesn't he?</b>

832
00:40:57,189 --> 00:41:01,165
<b>I remember how he enjoyed
this acorn jelly too.</b>

833
00:41:01,189 --> 00:41:02,290
<b>Have some as well.</b>

834
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:07,600
<b>Please have a seat, everyone.</b>

835
00:41:08,699 --> 00:41:11,529
<b>So the ladies want three things.</b>

836
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,970
<b>One, change your sign out front.</b>

837
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,839
<b>Two, no attracting customers.</b>

838
00:41:17,339 --> 00:41:20,410
<b>Three, appropriate attire.</b>

839
00:41:20,839 --> 00:41:22,255
<b>Will you accept those conditions?</b>

840
00:41:22,279 --> 00:41:23,550
<b>Right.</b>

841
00:41:23,879 --> 00:41:27,350
<b>I'll change my sign out front
as soon as possible...</b>

842
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:29,590
<b>and refrain from attracting
customers on the street.</b>

843
00:41:30,019 --> 00:41:31,959
<b>But the clothes and makeup...</b>

844
00:41:33,819 --> 00:41:37,060
<b>Okay, fine.
I can change what I wear.</b>

845
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:39,730
<b>But I can't give up my hairstyle.</b>

846
00:41:40,129 --> 00:41:41,875
<b>Just like you...</b>

847
00:41:41,899 --> 00:41:44,199
<b>pray underneath the talisman...</b>

848
00:41:44,829 --> 00:41:48,040
<b>for a successful
day of sale every day,</b>

849
00:41:48,199 --> 00:41:50,245
<b>we go to the salon every morning...</b>

850
00:41:50,269 --> 00:41:53,410
<b>to get ourselves ready
for what's to come that day.</b>

851
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:57,910
<b>Our hairstyle is our talisman
and our symbol.</b>

852
00:41:58,009 --> 00:41:59,720
<b>This I can't give up.</b>

853
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:03,519
<b>Okay, sure. Your clothes
were the real issue anyway.</b>

854
00:42:04,089 --> 00:42:06,959
<b>I didn't really care
about your hair either.</b>

855
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:09,959
<b>Okay, then.
So we've come to an agreement.</b>

856
00:42:10,189 --> 00:42:11,735
<b>Do you now approve...</b>

857
00:42:11,759 --> 00:42:15,206
<b>of Unnie's Kimbap joining
the merchant association?</b>

858
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:16,769
<b>What you say here is final.</b>

859
00:42:17,199 --> 00:42:19,199
<b>- Sure thing.
- I'm good.</b>

860
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:23,146
<b>Then go ahead and shake hands...</b>

861
00:42:23,170 --> 00:42:24,810
<b>to show that you've made peace.</b>

862
00:42:25,509 --> 00:42:28,610
<b>What? That is hardly necessary.</b>

863
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:30,680
<b>You do it instead, Young Dal.</b>

864
00:42:31,209 --> 00:42:34,220
<b>You just never can be generous,
can you?</b>

865
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,850
<b>Okay, fine. Young Dal, go ahead.</b>

866
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,860
<b>Sure thing.</b>

867
00:42:41,189 --> 00:42:43,235
<b>I know we clashed at first,</b>

868
00:42:43,259 --> 00:42:46,860
<b>but let bygones be bygones
and move forward from here.</b>

869
00:42:47,259 --> 00:42:48,670
<b>Welcome to our market.</b>

870
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:51,740
<b>- Sure. Thanks.
- Good.</b>

871
00:42:52,370 --> 00:42:54,939
<b>- Let's applaud.
- All right.</b>

872
00:42:56,709 --> 00:42:58,579
<b>I doubt the girls have
anything long to wear.</b>

873
00:42:58,639 --> 00:43:00,079
<b>Must we go shopping?</b>

874
00:43:00,509 --> 00:43:01,779
<b>How annoying!</b>

875
00:43:04,779 --> 00:43:07,980
<b>I'm only taking a step back
so I can take two steps forward.</b>

876
00:43:08,990 --> 00:43:10,920
<b>We'll see who gets
the last laugh, ladies.</b>

877
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:15,430
<b>Ma'am!</b>

878
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:19,259
<b>- Goodness.
- You're here.</b>

879
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:21,160
<b>What did you bring today?</b>

880
00:43:21,459 --> 00:43:22,875
<b>Shepherd's purse
and things like that.</b>

881
00:43:22,899 --> 00:43:24,906
<b>The spinach last time was delicious.</b>

882
00:43:24,930 --> 00:43:26,646
<b>Thank you for enjoying it.</b>

883
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:27,740
<b>Let me drag this for you.</b>

884
00:43:28,339 --> 00:43:30,069
<b>Guys, why weren't you picking up?</b>

885
00:43:31,269 --> 00:43:33,810
<b>Jong Soo, what's wrong?</b>

886
00:43:34,139 --> 00:43:35,755
<b>Are you sick? Talk to me.</b>

887
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:37,610
<b>I woke up today...</b>

888
00:43:38,209 --> 00:43:41,596
<b>but my body was aching all over
and I couldn't move.</b>

889
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:43,350
<b>Then you should've
gone to see a doctor.</b>

890
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:45,995
<b>Where's Jeong Bong?</b>

891
00:43:46,019 --> 00:43:48,019
<b>Jeong Bong...</b>

892
00:43:52,829 --> 00:43:54,776
<b>What's wrong with you?</b>

893
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,670
<b>Joon Seon, it's the mold.</b>

894
00:43:57,269 --> 00:43:58,970
<b>I'm allergic to it, you know.</b>

895
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:01,069
<b>This place is too damp...</b>

896
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:03,670
<b>and I can't live here.</b>

897
00:44:11,949 --> 00:44:13,420
<b>Can you scratch my back for me?</b>

898
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:15,920
<b>Unbelievable.</b>

899
00:44:17,589 --> 00:44:18,589
<b>Come on in.</b>

900
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:24,290
<b>Are you sure we can stay here?</b>

901
00:44:25,459 --> 00:44:27,800
<b>It'll be uncomfortable
to share the space with us.</b>

902
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:30,470
<b>Don't sweat it.
When did that ever worry me?</b>

903
00:44:30,930 --> 00:44:34,045
<b>As you can see,
it was cheaper to let it rot...</b>

904
00:44:34,069 --> 00:44:35,415
<b>rather than fix it up for a rental.</b>

905
00:44:35,439 --> 00:44:37,985
<b>The ceiling leaks sometimes
and the toilet gets clogged,</b>

906
00:44:38,009 --> 00:44:39,279
<b>but it'll be better here.</b>

907
00:44:39,509 --> 00:44:42,649
<b>Thanks, Joon Seon.
This place is like a hotel to us.</b>

908
00:44:42,850 --> 00:44:44,310
<b>Thank you so much, Joon Seon!</b>

909
00:44:45,009 --> 00:44:46,120
<b>Keep your voice down.</b>

910
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:48,649
<b>Guys, listen up.</b>

911
00:44:49,250 --> 00:44:50,490
<b>Just so you know,</b>

912
00:44:50,550 --> 00:44:52,710
<b>I'm not exactly the most
welcomed person in the family.</b>

913
00:44:53,019 --> 00:44:56,759
<b>Rather than a son,
they see me as a tenant.</b>

914
00:44:56,889 --> 00:44:59,735
<b>So would they be happy to know
that I've brought in...</b>

915
00:44:59,759 --> 00:45:01,199
<b>two more people?</b>

916
00:45:01,329 --> 00:45:02,406
<b>No, they wouldn't.</b>

917
00:45:02,430 --> 00:45:03,970
<b>- They'd hate it.
- Right?</b>

918
00:45:04,230 --> 00:45:07,875
<b>So you must stay silent
and be almost like ghosts.</b>

919
00:45:07,899 --> 00:45:09,370
<b>- Do you understand?
- I do.</b>

920
00:45:09,870 --> 00:45:11,509
<b>- What did I mean?
- What?</b>

921
00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:14,009
<b>What did he mean?</b>

922
00:45:14,710 --> 00:45:16,350
<b>Could you repeat that?</b>

923
00:45:18,049 --> 00:45:20,395
<b>So in short, you two will now...</b>

924
00:45:20,419 --> 00:45:21,580
<b>be ghosts in this house.</b>

925
00:45:21,990 --> 00:45:24,720
<b>Until I get us a deal
for a new place,</b>

926
00:45:25,289 --> 00:45:27,596
<b>you'll practice being invisible.</b>

927
00:45:27,620 --> 00:45:29,265
<b>- What did I say?
- Be invisible.</b>

928
00:45:29,289 --> 00:45:32,735
<b>That's right. You can probably
tell this by the wallpaper,</b>

929
00:45:32,759 --> 00:45:35,570
<b>but this is an old house,
so the walls are thin.</b>

930
00:45:35,899 --> 00:45:37,500
<b>My mom may not be an issue,</b>

931
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:40,440
<b>but my dad is someone
you need to watch out for.</b>

932
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:42,046
<b>He's a dangerous man.</b>

933
00:45:42,070 --> 00:45:44,686
<b>If you get caught,
he'll kick me out too.</b>

934
00:45:44,710 --> 00:45:45,940
<b>He might even kill me.</b>

935
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:47,639
<b>He sleeps lightly too.</b>

936
00:45:47,809 --> 00:45:50,480
<b>- Do you get me?
- Yes, we get you.</b>

937
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:52,679
<b>- I'll be careful.
- Good.</b>

938
00:45:54,879 --> 00:45:57,250
<b>- Seriously?
- Sorry, it was my dumbbells.</b>

939
00:45:57,750 --> 00:45:58,789
<b>Gosh.</b>

940
00:45:59,190 --> 00:46:02,490
<b>I thought that
nothing scared the woman,</b>

941
00:46:03,830 --> 00:46:08,500
<b>so hearing her talk about her hair
was a bit of a surprise.</b>

942
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:11,816
<b>I did feel bad for her in a way.</b>

943
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:14,240
<b>Don't be ridiculous.</b>

944
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:17,039
<b>- No one told her to stick it out.
- Exactly.</b>

945
00:46:17,370 --> 00:46:19,940
<b>Anyway, we got what we wanted.</b>

946
00:46:20,779 --> 00:46:21,879
<b>Gosh, that feels great.</b>

947
00:46:22,350 --> 00:46:23,879
<b>Hello, ladies.</b>

948
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:27,580
<b>- Hi, Ms. Jang.
- Hi, Yun Jeong.</b>

949
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:29,049
<b>Sorry, Ms. Choi.</b>

950
00:46:29,750 --> 00:46:31,995
<b>You must be here
to shop for groceries.</b>

951
00:46:32,019 --> 00:46:33,360
<b>It's good to see you, Ms. Choi.</b>

952
00:46:33,820 --> 00:46:36,535
<b>It's been a while.
Has business been well?</b>

953
00:46:36,559 --> 00:46:38,775
<b>Yes, of course!</b>

954
00:46:38,799 --> 00:46:41,035
<b>So is Ok Boon at the store?</b>

955
00:46:41,059 --> 00:46:43,676
<b>No, Na Hee took her out on a date.</b>

956
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:44,870
<b>They're on Ganghwa Island.</b>

957
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:47,669
<b>A date?</b>

958
00:46:49,669 --> 00:46:52,179
<b>I'm having dinner
with my son this evening too.</b>

959
00:46:52,340 --> 00:46:54,779
<b>My second son
has come back from Turkey.</b>

960
00:46:55,950 --> 00:46:57,549
<b>I see.</b>

961
00:46:58,580 --> 00:46:59,620
<b>Then...</b>

962
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:03,120
<b>Have a good day then.</b>

963
00:47:07,220 --> 00:47:10,789
<b>Why does she always
greet people like that?</b>

964
00:47:11,259 --> 00:47:12,759
<b>She never bows her head.</b>

965
00:47:13,230 --> 00:47:15,029
<b>She owns a building, remember?</b>

966
00:47:15,529 --> 00:47:18,470
<b>I guess she believes
she's too classy for us.</b>

967
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:21,870
<b>Fundamentally,
we're all human beings though.</b>

968
00:47:22,139 --> 00:47:23,570
<b>She's always been a jerk.</b>

969
00:47:24,269 --> 00:47:27,409
<b>Even since high school,
she'd glance at others like that.</b>

970
00:47:27,940 --> 00:47:29,140
<b>It's an illness if you ask me.</b>

971
00:47:29,610 --> 00:47:30,879
<b>My gosh.</b>

972
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:35,926
<b>She never wants
to have a meal with me,</b>

973
00:47:35,950 --> 00:47:38,690
<b>but she goes off on a date
with her mom? Unbelievable.</b>

974
00:47:39,759 --> 00:47:40,820
<b>You're back, Ms. Choi.</b>

975
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:43,230
<b>Please let me take that.</b>

976
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:47,460
<b>It's fascinating how two sisters
can be so different.</b>

977
00:47:49,230 --> 00:47:51,700
<b>Why did you buy so much today?</b>

978
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:55,846
<b>I'm grilling some steak today.
It's a special day,</b>

979
00:47:55,870 --> 00:47:58,840
<b>so I was hoping to
enjoy it with my son...</b>

980
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:00,539
<b>accompanied by a glass of wine.</b>

981
00:48:01,110 --> 00:48:02,480
<b>That'd be nice.</b>

982
00:48:05,279 --> 00:48:07,919
<b>I wonder when he'll get here though.</b>

983
00:48:10,490 --> 00:48:13,259
<b>Son, when will you
be home this evening?</b>

984
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:16,005
<b>Mom, I'm going to be
a bit late today.</b>

985
00:48:16,029 --> 00:48:18,330
<b>An implant procedure
has been scheduled.</b>

986
00:48:18,389 --> 00:48:19,706
<b>What?</b>

987
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:22,200
<b>You promised to have
dinner with me today!</b>

988
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:23,870
<b>Did I? When?</b>

989
00:48:24,429 --> 00:48:27,169
<b>I guess that's what you said,
but I didn't hear it.</b>

990
00:48:27,269 --> 00:48:30,840
<b>Do you have a death wish?
Come home right after the surgery.</b>

991
00:48:31,009 --> 00:48:33,409
<b>I don't want to eat alone tonight.</b>

992
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:37,186
<b>What did you say?
I can't hear you. What?</b>

993
00:48:37,210 --> 00:48:39,025
<b>Mom? I'm busy. I have to go.</b>

994
00:48:39,049 --> 00:48:40,655
<b>I'm sorry, Mom. I love you.</b>

995
00:48:40,679 --> 00:48:42,196
<b>Hey. Well...</b>

996
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:43,320
<b>Jae Seok!</b>

997
00:48:44,919 --> 00:48:47,590
<b>Gosh. That jerk.</b>

998
00:48:57,169 --> 00:48:58,399
<b>Ms. Choi.</b>

999
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:03,509
<b>I like steak.</b>

1000
00:49:06,539 --> 00:49:07,879
<b>Why did you lie to her?</b>

1001
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:11,009
<b>Your afternoon schedule is empty,
so you're just slaking off.</b>

1002
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:13,495
<b>Mom wants to have dinner with me.</b>

1003
00:49:13,519 --> 00:49:16,919
<b>I don't want to be alone
with Mom anymore, Gyu Jin.</b>

1004
00:49:17,990 --> 00:49:19,659
<b>So?</b>

1005
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:22,289
<b>What are you going to do
with the TV show?</b>

1006
00:49:23,129 --> 00:49:25,700
<b>Gosh, I don't know.
I'm still thinking.</b>

1007
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:28,000
<b>Why is everything so tough for you?</b>

1008
00:49:44,179 --> 00:49:46,980
<b>What are you thinking about,
Dr. Yoon?</b>

1009
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:48,926
<b>Hi, Bo Young.</b>

1010
00:49:48,950 --> 00:49:52,590
<b>You looked so lonely from the back,
so I wondered who it was.</b>

1011
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:55,960
<b>Why? Are you worried
about something?</b>

1012
00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:58,159
<b>No, I'm not worried.</b>

1013
00:49:59,029 --> 00:50:00,659
<b>I guess you are.</b>

1014
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,200
<b>You never could hide your feelings.</b>

1015
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,769
<b>What's wrong?</b>

1016
00:50:06,269 --> 00:50:08,039
<b>I just have a lot on my mind.</b>

1017
00:50:09,309 --> 00:50:12,240
<b>I'm not sure
if I made the right choice.</b>

1018
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:16,649
<b>Life is a series of choices.</b>

1019
00:50:17,179 --> 00:50:21,750
<b>And it's not so bad to make
a wrong choice from time to time.</b>

1020
00:50:22,419 --> 00:50:25,120
<b>It makes you feel confident
about your next choice.</b>

1021
00:50:26,620 --> 00:50:27,690
<b>You think?</b>

1022
00:50:27,759 --> 00:50:31,035
<b>Yes. So don't lose sleep over it...</b>

1023
00:50:31,059 --> 00:50:33,830
<b>and just go ahead with your choice.</b>

1024
00:50:41,139 --> 00:50:43,139
<b>- What?
- You haven't changed at all.</b>

1025
00:50:43,610 --> 00:50:45,710
<b>You used to give me a lot of advice.</b>

1026
00:50:46,679 --> 00:50:48,655
<b>Gosh, you're quite nosy.</b>

1027
00:50:48,679 --> 00:50:51,179
<b>What? How dare you say that?</b>

1028
00:50:52,850 --> 00:50:54,149
<b>It doesn't hurt at all.</b>

1029
00:50:55,590 --> 00:50:56,750
<b>Don't tease me.</b>

1030
00:51:07,330 --> 00:51:08,476
<b>Have some bread.</b>

1031
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:11,775
<b>Okay. This place is so nice.</b>

1032
00:51:11,799 --> 00:51:13,340
<b>And the coffee smells great.</b>

1033
00:51:14,870 --> 00:51:16,409
<b>The coffee is really good.</b>

1034
00:51:17,570 --> 00:51:20,509
<b>Ga Hee is going
to cook dinner, right?</b>

1035
00:51:20,740 --> 00:51:23,586
<b>If she can't, she will at least
order some Chinse food.</b>

1036
00:51:23,610 --> 00:51:26,649
<b>Sure. She has a son.
She wouldn't let him skip a meal.</b>

1037
00:51:26,820 --> 00:51:30,250
<b>Don't worry.
Why worry about their dinner here?</b>

1038
00:51:30,889 --> 00:51:33,059
<b>I know. This is my problem.</b>

1039
00:51:33,519 --> 00:51:35,765
<b>All right. I don't care
if they skip a meal or not.</b>

1040
00:51:35,789 --> 00:51:37,159
<b>I'm on strike today.</b>

1041
00:51:38,059 --> 00:51:40,206
<b>I'm so lucky today.</b>

1042
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:43,100
<b>Then do you want to live
with me like this?</b>

1043
00:51:43,399 --> 00:51:45,775
<b>You can travel around with me
every weekend...</b>

1044
00:51:45,799 --> 00:51:47,416
<b>and eat lots of delicious food.</b>

1045
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:50,669
<b>It's okay. You have your family.
I know that's not easy.</b>

1046
00:51:50,809 --> 00:51:53,179
<b>This is good enough for me.</b>

1047
00:52:03,289 --> 00:52:06,559
<b>Mom. The thing is...</b>

1048
00:52:10,789 --> 00:52:11,860
<b>Gosh.</b>

1049
00:52:12,090 --> 00:52:15,546
<b>When Gyu Jin came to my place
the other day, he was thirsty.</b>

1050
00:52:15,570 --> 00:52:17,946
<b>So I told him to drink juice
in the fridge.</b>

1051
00:52:17,970 --> 00:52:19,875
<b>That day, I got...</b>

1052
00:52:19,899 --> 00:52:22,970
<b>some red pepper oil
in a juice bottle from the mill.</b>

1053
00:52:23,870 --> 00:52:26,539
<b>He just drank it up.</b>

1054
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:30,409
<b>He kept gasping out
and his eyes turned red.</b>

1055
00:52:30,950 --> 00:52:32,519
<b>It was hilarious.</b>

1056
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:38,826
<b>Why do you keep
talking about Gyu Jin?</b>

1057
00:52:38,850 --> 00:52:41,365
<b>You've been talking about
nothing but him all day.</b>

1058
00:52:41,389 --> 00:52:43,629
<b>That's because he is
my one and only son-in-law.</b>

1059
00:52:44,789 --> 00:52:45,799
<b>Gosh.</b>

1060
00:52:45,899 --> 00:52:48,730
<b>Are you jealous of him?</b>

1061
00:52:53,169 --> 00:52:55,100
<b>You know what?</b>

1062
00:52:56,039 --> 00:52:58,145
<b>Sometimes Gyu Jin is very reliable,</b>

1063
00:52:58,169 --> 00:53:00,480
<b>and sometimes
he's like a little kid.</b>

1064
00:53:01,309 --> 00:53:03,950
<b>Unlike Yun Jeong, he's just lovely.</b>

1065
00:53:05,009 --> 00:53:08,456
<b>Oh, right. We should call Gyu Jin.</b>

1066
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:09,895
<b>I wonder if he's doing well
without his car.</b>

1067
00:53:09,919 --> 00:53:11,690
<b>It's okay. I'll call him later.</b>

1068
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:13,820
<b>I need to go to the restroom.</b>

1069
00:53:22,159 --> 00:53:23,370
<b>You should tell her.</b>

1070
00:53:24,570 --> 00:53:26,169
<b>You have to tell her, Na Hee.</b>

1071
00:53:32,809 --> 00:53:34,985
<b>Gosh, what should I do?</b>

1072
00:53:35,009 --> 00:53:37,926
<b>What a waste. This is terrible.</b>

1073
00:53:37,950 --> 00:53:39,319
<b>My goodness.</b>

1074
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:43,265
<b>Mom, what's that? What happened?</b>

1075
00:53:43,289 --> 00:53:45,936
<b>I tried to stand up
and get some water,</b>

1076
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:47,920
<b>but I accidentally knocked it away.</b>

1077
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:51,190
<b>Do you think I can pick up
the pieces on the top?</b>

1078
00:53:52,029 --> 00:53:55,005
<b>You can't eat this. Just get up.
It might ruin your clothes.</b>

1079
00:53:55,029 --> 00:53:58,106
<b>I can't believe this.
It was for Gyu Jin.</b>

1080
00:53:58,130 --> 00:54:00,015
<b>Gyu Jin loves acorn jelly.</b>

1081
00:54:00,039 --> 00:54:02,946
<b>I'm so stupid.
I should've been careful.</b>

1082
00:54:02,970 --> 00:54:05,910
<b>I didn't even check
if it was sealed.</b>

1083
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:10,049
<b>Is it too far to go back there
and buy it again?</b>

1084
00:54:11,450 --> 00:54:14,049
<b>My goodness.</b>

1085
00:54:14,150 --> 00:54:17,089
<b>What a waste. I feel so terrible.</b>

1086
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:18,920
<b>My gosh.</b>

1087
00:54:21,059 --> 00:54:24,366
<b>This is really upsetting.</b>

1088
00:54:24,390 --> 00:54:25,759
<b>This was for Gyu Jin.</b>

1089
00:54:56,559 --> 00:54:59,799
<b>(Ttobongee Chicken)</b>

1090
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:03,206
<b>This is Mr. Song Young Dal.
And this is Ms. Jang.</b>

1091
00:55:03,230 --> 00:55:07,440
<b>Mr. Song's wife is not here today.
You'll meet her tomorrow.</b>

1092
00:55:08,869 --> 00:55:11,940
<b>Ms. Jang, will you stop drooling?</b>

1093
00:55:13,140 --> 00:55:16,825
<b>Welcome. Nice to meet you.
What's your name?</b>

1094
00:55:16,849 --> 00:55:19,119
<b>I'm Park Hyo Sin.
Nice to meet you.</b>

1095
00:55:19,250 --> 00:55:22,079
<b>I'm glad you're here.
I hope we get along.</b>

1096
00:55:23,019 --> 00:55:26,095
<b>By the way, you're so handsome.</b>

1097
00:55:26,119 --> 00:55:28,265
<b>You have a creamy complexion.</b>

1098
00:55:28,289 --> 00:55:31,359
<b>We don't even need a light
in the store.</b>

1099
00:55:31,490 --> 00:55:33,876
<b>I don't even smell
the hot oil anymore.</b>

1100
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:34,930
<b>Thank you.</b>

1101
00:55:35,769 --> 00:55:38,946
<b>You need to know the neighborhood
to deliver chickens.</b>

1102
00:55:38,970 --> 00:55:40,176
<b>You might have a hard time
for the time being.</b>

1103
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:41,876
<b>No, I know this neighborhood.</b>

1104
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:43,539
<b>My friend lives around here.</b>

1105
00:55:45,339 --> 00:55:46,856
<b>Dad, I brought pepper powder.</b>

1106
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:49,349
<b>The owner wasn't there,
so I waited for a long time.</b>

1107
00:55:49,450 --> 00:55:51,250
<b>- You're here.
- Long time no see.</b>

1108
00:55:52,250 --> 00:55:53,250
<b>Well...</b>

1109
00:55:56,450 --> 00:55:58,366
<b>We will start doing deliveries.</b>

1110
00:55:58,390 --> 00:55:59,859
<b>He's the deliveryman.</b>

1111
00:56:00,059 --> 00:56:01,459
<b>This is Mr. Song's oldest daughter.</b>

1112
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:05,089
<b>Hello. Nice to meet you.</b>

1113
00:56:06,730 --> 00:56:09,035
<b>Did you bring your driver's license
and insurance certificate?</b>

1114
00:56:09,059 --> 00:56:10,376
<b>Yes. Here.</b>

1115
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:11,430
<b>Let me see.</b>

1116
00:56:12,230 --> 00:56:15,099
<b>It's so good to see you.</b>

1117
00:56:15,170 --> 00:56:18,009
<b>This is the working environment
I've always wanted.</b>

1118
00:56:19,309 --> 00:56:23,109
<b>Women care so much
about men's looks.</b>

1119
00:56:23,210 --> 00:56:25,555
<b>It's not just men
who like beautiful women.</b>

1120
00:56:25,579 --> 00:56:28,549
<b>Will you move over? I can't see him.</b>

1121
00:56:28,619 --> 00:56:30,420
<b>- My goodness.
- Move over.</b>

1122
00:56:32,789 --> 00:56:35,866
<b>Gosh, I'm still upset
about the acorn jelly.</b>

1123
00:56:35,890 --> 00:56:38,259
<b>Why could I drop it like that?</b>

1124
00:56:39,799 --> 00:56:41,075
<b>This just won't do.</b>

1125
00:56:41,099 --> 00:56:43,400
<b>I should come again
with Gyu Jin next time.</b>

1126
00:56:44,029 --> 00:56:47,769
<b>I won't be satisfied
until I see him eat the acorn jelly.</b>

1127
00:56:48,869 --> 00:56:52,170
<b>I guess the traffic is bad
on weekends.</b>

1128
00:56:52,710 --> 00:56:53,740
<b>Right?</b>

1129
00:56:55,210 --> 00:56:57,650
<b>Na Hee, why are you being so quiet?</b>

1130
00:56:57,849 --> 00:56:58,849
<b>Are you sleepy?</b>

1131
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:00,755
<b>No.</b>

1132
00:57:00,779 --> 00:57:03,319
<b>You shouldn't doze off
while driving.</b>

1133
00:57:04,250 --> 00:57:06,190
<b>Here. Open your mouth.</b>

1134
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:14,400
<b>Mom. You should wear gloves
when you fry chicken.</b>

1135
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:16,106
<b>Look at your hands.</b>

1136
00:57:16,130 --> 00:57:18,845
<b>It's okay. I'm used to it.</b>

1137
00:57:18,869 --> 00:57:20,446
<b>Make sure to use ointment.
It might leave a scar.</b>

1138
00:57:20,470 --> 00:57:22,200
<b>Okay. I will.</b>

1139
00:57:23,039 --> 00:57:25,515
<b>I wish every day was like today.</b>

1140
00:57:25,539 --> 00:57:27,380
<b>I'm so happy.</b>

1141
00:57:33,150 --> 00:57:36,990
<b>This looks amazing, Ms. Choi.
It's like I'm in a restaurant.</b>

1142
00:57:37,190 --> 00:57:39,265
<b>Try it.
It doesn't taste bad either.</b>

1143
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:40,460
<b>With some wine.</b>

1144
00:57:45,390 --> 00:57:46,559
<b>This is crazy.</b>

1145
00:57:47,230 --> 00:57:48,930
<b>It's so delicious.</b>

1146
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:52,069
<b>It's so tender
than I don't have to chew it.</b>

1147
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:56,146
<b>You're so good at cooking.</b>

1148
00:57:56,170 --> 00:57:59,210
<b>That's not true.
I just used good meat.</b>

1149
00:58:00,210 --> 00:58:02,279
<b>You should try some. Here.</b>

1150
00:58:09,079 --> 00:58:10,390
<b>It's good.</b>

1151
00:58:11,319 --> 00:58:12,349
<b>Wait.</b>

1152
00:58:13,059 --> 00:58:15,859
<b>That's against the rule.
You can't drink alone.</b>

1153
00:58:24,930 --> 00:58:26,769
<b>How old did you say you were?</b>

1154
00:58:27,069 --> 00:58:28,240
<b>I'm 28.</b>

1155
00:58:29,410 --> 00:58:30,670
<b>What a great age.</b>

1156
00:58:31,839 --> 00:58:33,485
<b>If I were born now,</b>

1157
00:58:33,509 --> 00:58:35,809
<b>I'd have done everything I wanted.</b>

1158
00:58:36,109 --> 00:58:38,426
<b>In my time,
marrying well and having kids...</b>

1159
00:58:38,450 --> 00:58:39,956
<b>was a woman's standard of happiness.</b>

1160
00:58:39,980 --> 00:58:41,420
<b>It all means nothing.</b>

1161
00:58:42,789 --> 00:58:44,466
<b>It doesn't mean nothing.</b>

1162
00:58:44,490 --> 00:58:47,035
<b>You raised both sons to be doctors.</b>

1163
00:58:47,059 --> 00:58:48,735
<b>What's the point in that?</b>

1164
00:58:48,759 --> 00:58:50,890
<b>They think they did it themselves.</b>

1165
00:58:51,289 --> 00:58:52,876
<b>I suffered to raise them,</b>

1166
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:55,259
<b>and now they ignore me
to enjoy their own lives.</b>

1167
00:58:58,599 --> 00:59:02,970
<b>Today is a rough day for me,
and I feel sentimental.</b>

1168
00:59:04,009 --> 00:59:06,779
<b>It's the anniversary of
my first date with my husband.</b>

1169
00:59:09,180 --> 00:59:12,180
<b>Oh, dear.
I can't believe I said that.</b>

1170
00:59:12,650 --> 00:59:14,325
<b>You should eat and close the cafe.</b>

1171
00:59:14,349 --> 00:59:16,349
<b>- Let's eat.
- Yes, ma'am.</b>

1172
00:59:16,849 --> 00:59:18,619
<b>The steak is really amazing.</b>

1173
00:59:28,529 --> 00:59:30,329
<b>Did I eat too much?</b>

1174
00:59:41,710 --> 00:59:42,950
<b>What are you doing?</b>

1175
00:59:44,079 --> 00:59:45,325
<b>I was going to pass by,</b>

1176
00:59:45,349 --> 00:59:47,126
<b>but I came in to ask.</b>

1177
00:59:47,150 --> 00:59:49,825
<b>Ms. Song. How could you
betray me at that moment?</b>

1178
00:59:49,849 --> 00:59:51,896
<b>Do you know how long
I suffered because of you?</b>

1179
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:54,119
<b>I don't know and I have to close up.</b>

1180
00:59:54,490 --> 00:59:56,630
<b>Why don't you spend time
with your mother instead?</b>

1181
00:59:56,829 --> 00:59:58,690
<b>What? You're changing
the topic again?</b>

1182
00:59:59,329 --> 01:00:02,099
<b>No. We need to talk this out today.</b>

1183
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:04,230
<b>Must you make me feel
so uncomfortable?</b>

1184
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:06,315
<b>What did I do that's so wrong?</b>

1185
01:00:06,339 --> 01:00:08,339
<b>You didn't do anything wrong.</b>

1186
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:10,716
<b>So go and check on your mother.</b>

1187
01:00:10,740 --> 01:00:13,356
<b>Why do you keep mentioning my mom?</b>

1188
01:00:13,380 --> 01:00:14,485
<b>She's not a baby!</b>

1189
01:00:14,509 --> 01:00:17,426
<b>There's a reason for all this,
so just go upstairs.</b>

1190
01:00:17,450 --> 01:00:19,595
<b>- Get out of here.
- Wait, Ms. Song.</b>

1191
01:00:19,619 --> 01:00:22,150
<b>- Get out already.
- Why are you so strong?</b>

1192
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:25,220
<b>- Wait, wait.
- Get out! My gosh.</b>

1193
01:00:28,619 --> 01:00:29,829
<b>Mr. Yoon.</b>

1194
01:00:40,039 --> 01:00:41,039
<b>Ms. Song.</b>

1195
01:00:42,539 --> 01:00:45,369
<b>Oh, dear. It looks very swollen.</b>

1196
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:48,186
<b>I'm so sorry.</b>

1197
01:00:48,210 --> 01:00:50,109
<b>Shouldn't you go to a hospital?</b>

1198
01:00:50,509 --> 01:00:52,279
<b>I work at a hospital.</b>

1199
01:00:52,509 --> 01:00:54,325
<b>I'll get an x-ray
as soon as I get there,</b>

1200
01:00:54,349 --> 01:00:55,819
<b>and ask for an estimate.</b>

1201
01:00:56,450 --> 01:01:00,319
<b>I'll get some painkillers
and pain relief patches for now.</b>

1202
01:01:00,619 --> 01:01:02,319
<b>No, sit back down.</b>

1203
01:01:04,589 --> 01:01:05,859
<b>Forget the pain relief patches.</b>

1204
01:01:06,900 --> 01:01:08,805
<b>- Are you really sorry?
- Of course I am.</b>

1205
01:01:08,829 --> 01:01:10,829
<b>I feel so bad I want to die.</b>

1206
01:01:11,099 --> 01:01:13,500
<b>Then including treatment
and pain relief patches,</b>

1207
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:16,186
<b>- buy me something else.
- Something else?</b>

1208
01:01:16,210 --> 01:01:17,640
<b>Okay. What?</b>

1209
01:01:18,039 --> 01:01:19,980
<b>- Thank you.
- Goodbye.</b>

1210
01:01:20,910 --> 01:01:23,779
<b>How can you want alcohol
instead of pain relief patches?</b>

1211
01:01:24,109 --> 01:01:26,349
<b>It's not just alcohol.
It's a reconciliation drink.</b>

1212
01:01:26,819 --> 01:01:29,819
<b>I feel bad for what
I did to you, and vice versa.</b>

1213
01:01:30,750 --> 01:01:32,720
<b>Let's drink this
and call it even. Okay?</b>

1214
01:01:33,259 --> 01:01:34,259
<b>Okay.</b>

1215
01:01:35,490 --> 01:01:38,305
<b>I'm a bit cheeky
and on the naughty side,</b>

1216
01:01:38,329 --> 01:01:39,759
<b>so I sometimes cross the line.</b>

1217
01:01:40,460 --> 01:01:42,700
<b>Even more so with people
who I think I clicked with.</b>

1218
01:01:43,170 --> 01:01:44,706
<b>I'm truly sorry.</b>

1219
01:01:44,730 --> 01:01:47,140
<b>Don't be. I was small-minded.</b>

1220
01:01:47,339 --> 01:01:49,015
<b>I let my inferiority complex
control me.</b>

1221
01:01:49,039 --> 01:01:50,686
<b>It's fine.</b>

1222
01:01:50,710 --> 01:01:53,680
<b>We both feel bad,
so let's not talk about that again.</b>

1223
01:01:54,410 --> 01:01:56,549
<b>- Here. Cheers.
- Cheers.</b>

1224
01:02:00,849 --> 01:02:02,079
<b>Let's eat.</b>

1225
01:02:06,519 --> 01:02:10,035
<b>Order more food.
I'll eat 64 dollars' worth.</b>

1226
01:02:10,059 --> 01:02:11,859
<b>Oh, come on!</b>

1227
01:02:12,589 --> 01:02:15,329
<b>Eat up quickly
and comfort your mother.</b>

1228
01:02:16,099 --> 01:02:18,799
<b>She said it's a special day for her.</b>

1229
01:02:19,539 --> 01:02:22,116
<b>It's the first day
she met your late father.</b>

1230
01:02:22,140 --> 01:02:23,539
<b>She was so lonely.</b>

1231
01:02:23,940 --> 01:02:26,480
<b>I ate with her in your place.</b>

1232
01:02:28,009 --> 01:02:29,339
<b>That's why she said...</b>

1233
01:02:30,009 --> 01:02:32,250
<b>She should've just said so.</b>

1234
01:02:33,180 --> 01:02:37,190
<b>Moms get upset by the smallest
of things the older they get.</b>

1235
01:02:37,549 --> 01:02:40,589
<b>So care a bit more for her
from now on.</b>

1236
01:02:41,690 --> 01:02:43,305
<b>She likes flowers,</b>

1237
01:02:43,329 --> 01:02:45,660
<b>so you can surprise her
with a bouquet delivered.</b>

1238
01:02:48,099 --> 01:02:50,799
<b>I'm glad you were there for her.</b>

1239
01:02:51,970 --> 01:02:55,269
<b>I hope you work at her cafe
for a long time.</b>

1240
01:02:55,970 --> 01:02:58,440
<b>I will only for a few months
until my transfer exam.</b>

1241
01:02:58,670 --> 01:03:00,339
<b>Are you studying to transfer?</b>

1242
01:03:01,839 --> 01:03:02,839
<b>Yes.</b>

1243
01:03:03,279 --> 01:03:06,380
<b>I'd like to study
what I'd always wanted to.</b>

1244
01:03:07,180 --> 01:03:09,565
<b>- Though it's a bit late.
- It's not late.</b>

1245
01:03:09,589 --> 01:03:11,250
<b>You can study at any age.</b>

1246
01:03:13,359 --> 01:03:15,160
<b>That's cool. You're amazing.</b>

1247
01:03:15,390 --> 01:03:17,335
<b>I thought you were timid.</b>

1248
01:03:17,359 --> 01:03:18,759
<b>Where did you get the guts?</b>

1249
01:03:19,230 --> 01:03:21,299
<b>I don't know. I found them.</b>

1250
01:03:21,799 --> 01:03:24,630
<b>I feel a little proud of myself
these days.</b>

1251
01:03:25,069 --> 01:03:26,740
<b>Do you study during the day?</b>

1252
01:03:27,599 --> 01:03:30,839
<b>It's so hard having to study
after years of not doing it.</b>

1253
01:03:31,109 --> 01:03:33,480
<b>I can manage English somehow,
but math...</b>

1254
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:36,509
<b>I was dreadful even in high school.</b>

1255
01:03:37,049 --> 01:03:39,485
<b>We share the same parents,</b>

1256
01:03:39,509 --> 01:03:41,519
<b>so why am I so dumb?</b>

1257
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:43,819
<b>Na Hee's best subject was math.</b>

1258
01:03:44,589 --> 01:03:45,619
<b>Do you know...</b>

1259
01:03:46,089 --> 01:03:48,789
<b>who did better in math than she?</b>

1260
01:03:49,059 --> 01:03:50,089
<b>Who?</b>

1261
01:03:52,390 --> 01:03:53,529
<b>It's me.</b>

1262
01:03:56,869 --> 01:03:58,376
<b>Ask me if you're stuck.</b>

1263
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:01,446
<b>I bet I'm better than any tutor
in Daechi-dong.</b>

1264
01:04:01,470 --> 01:04:03,240
<b>I'd be grateful for the help.</b>

1265
01:04:03,609 --> 01:04:05,285
<b>I'll really take you up on
the offer.</b>

1266
01:04:05,309 --> 01:04:06,839
<b>You should. No problem.</b>

1267
01:04:08,140 --> 01:04:11,009
<b>- I even speak English.
- Oh, stop it.</b>

1268
01:04:12,849 --> 01:04:15,849
<b>How about we have another drink?</b>

1269
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:22,589
<b>Let's get along
from now on, Ms. Song.</b>

1270
01:04:22,819 --> 01:04:24,460
<b>Yes, let's do that.</b>

1271
01:04:32,829 --> 01:04:34,345
<b>Can you really manage alone?</b>

1272
01:04:34,369 --> 01:04:35,646
<b>Shall I help you?</b>

1273
01:04:35,670 --> 01:04:37,839
<b>No, I live across the street.
I'll take my time.</b>

1274
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:39,785
<b>It's late. Go on home.</b>

1275
01:04:39,809 --> 01:04:41,240
<b>Go on. Go.</b>

1276
01:04:41,940 --> 01:04:43,456
<b>Put some ice on it later.</b>

1277
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:45,356
<b>And see a doctor about it tomorrow.</b>

1278
01:04:45,380 --> 01:04:48,049
<b>I will. How many times
will you say that?</b>

1279
01:04:49,049 --> 01:04:51,250
<b>Go on home. Go.</b>

1280
01:04:51,619 --> 01:04:53,660
<b>- Go home. Go.
- Goodbye.</b>

1281
01:05:58,490 --> 01:05:59,696
<b>Why is she so late?</b>

1282
01:05:59,720 --> 01:06:01,319
<b>(Director Jang)</b>

1283
01:06:02,390 --> 01:06:03,730
<b>Darn it.</b>

1284
01:06:06,829 --> 01:06:07,900
<b>You're home.</b>

1285
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:12,470
<b>Did you tell your mother?</b>

1286
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:16,470
<b>Did you tell her?</b>

1287
01:06:20,210 --> 01:06:22,616
<b>Don't take it. I'll be the director.</b>

1288
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:23,980
<b>He just called me.</b>

1289
01:06:26,079 --> 01:06:27,220
<b>Hello, Director Jang.</b>

1290
01:06:30,049 --> 01:06:31,049
<b>I'll do it.</b>

1291
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:36,119
<b>We'll go on TV.</b>

1292
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:42,230
<b>Flower delivery.</b>

1293
01:06:42,460 --> 01:06:45,130
<b>- Ms. Choi Yun Jeong?
- Yes, that's me.</b>

1294
01:06:45,900 --> 01:06:47,339
<b>These are for you.</b>

1295
01:06:47,839 --> 01:06:50,069
<b>- Sign here, please.
- Okay.</b>

1296
01:06:51,339 --> 01:06:53,069
<b>Who sent it?</b>

1297
01:06:53,579 --> 01:06:56,210
<b>It says Mr. Yoon Jae Seok.</b>

1298
01:06:57,710 --> 01:06:58,779
<b>My gosh.</b>

1299
01:06:59,309 --> 01:07:01,750
<b>It must be from your son.</b>

1300
01:07:02,450 --> 01:07:04,349
<b>How many flowers are there?</b>

1301
01:07:04,519 --> 01:07:08,396
<b>It's beautiful.
You must be so pleased, Ms. Choi.</b>

1302
01:07:08,420 --> 01:07:09,559
<b>Have a nice day.</b>

1303
01:07:10,130 --> 01:07:11,589
<b>Thank you.</b>

1304
01:07:12,130 --> 01:07:14,730
<b>Why did he send me flowers?</b>

1305
01:07:15,230 --> 01:07:17,829
<b>He can be so cheeky.</b>

1306
01:07:19,069 --> 01:07:20,339
<b>My dear son.</b>

1307
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:26,509
<b>Thank you so much
for agreeing to be on the show.</b>

1308
01:07:27,309 --> 01:07:30,109
<b>Especially Dr. Yoon Gyu Jin
and Dr. Song Na Hee.</b>

1309
01:07:30,349 --> 01:07:31,910
<b>I heard a lot about you.</b>

1310
01:07:32,380 --> 01:07:34,319
<b>You refused at first.</b>

1311
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:37,295
<b>We had some private issues that...</b>

1312
01:07:37,319 --> 01:07:38,626
<b>I must make this clear.</b>

1313
01:07:38,650 --> 01:07:41,089
<b>We won't be on for long.
It's just for two months.</b>

1314
01:07:41,359 --> 01:07:42,436
<b>Yes. Two months.</b>

1315
01:07:42,460 --> 01:07:44,859
<b>I was told about that too.
Don't worry.</b>

1316
01:07:45,029 --> 01:07:46,160
<b>Does this mean...</b>

1317
01:07:46,660 --> 01:07:50,029
<b>the panel of doctors
is just us four?</b>

1318

<b>No. There's an orthopedics

<b>Hello.</b>

1322
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:03,686
<b>I must be the last to arrive.

<b>Jeong Rok.</b>

<b>Gosh, Na Hee.
You haven't changed at all.</b>

- Seriously?</b>

<b>You'll make up for this.</b>

1333
01:08:58,670 --> 01:08:59,706
<b>What?</b>

1334
01:08:59,730 --> 01:09:02,676
<b>Hold on a second.
You're the one who knocked the cup,</b>

<b>Guys, come on down. No one's home.</b>

<b>Who are you people?</b>

<b>Ga Hee, you're home.</b>

<b>Gyu Jin!</b>
