00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:49,150
<b>I went there to scan his memory.</b>

316
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:51,420
<b>I was expecting to go to jail.</b>

317
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:54,420
<b>So I wanted to expose all his sins to the entire world.</b>

318
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:58,130
<b>So what happened?</b>

319
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,560
<b>I turned around...</b>

320
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:03,430
<b>in front of the church and went home.</b>

321
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:05,530
<b>After you went all the way there?</b>

322
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:08,570
<b>I remembered...</b>

323
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:12,980
<b>the view I saw a long time ago.</b>

324
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:17,550
<b>The view I saw from the window...</b>

325
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:19,480
<b>every single day after Cho Won went missing.</b>

326
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:22,350
<b>That's when I realized...</b>

327
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:25,150
<b>that she wouldn't want me...</b>

328
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:28,790
<b>to murder anyone.</b>

329
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:33,560
<b>Cho Won always wanted...</b>

330
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:36,670
<b>more and more people to find out about my power.</b>

331
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:39,540
<b>She thought that would encourage more people to be kind.</b>

332
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,940
<b>Ko Hyun Ah...</b>

333
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:46,710
<b>was driving back with the guy she was cheating with.</b>

334
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:56,120
<b>My gosh.</b>

335
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:57,790
<b>- What happened? - What happened?</b>

336
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:03,260
<b>- What are we going to do? - Let's put her here.</b>

337
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,860
<b>- Hurry. - Don't rush me.</b>

338
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:08,530
<b>My goodness.</b>

339
00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:11,300
<b>Help me.</b>

340
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,210
<b>- I think she's alive. - Darn it.</b>

341
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:18,440
<b>Help.</b>

342
00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:23,410
<b>Darn it. Hey, what are you doing?</b>

343
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,480
<b>- What are you doing? - Move!</b>

344
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,380
<b>No, don't. No!</b>

345
00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:30,720
<b>Hello, I'm Ko Hyun Ah.</b>

346
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:32,650
<b>I met her...</b>

347
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:34,820
<b>the day after the accident.</b>

348
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:37,990
<b>If only I had...</b>

349
00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:41,130
<b>shaken her hand.</b>

350
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:45,130
<b>If I shook her hand that day...</b>

351
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:51,970
<b>You exposed your power to the public to punish those murderers.</b>

352
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,810
<b>How did you know that?</b>

353
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:01,180
<b>My trial records are classified as a national secret.</b>

354
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:04,090
<b>You owe me one.</b>

355
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:09,160
<b>The NIS?</b>

356
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,860
<b>You have a good hunch. I'll give you that.</b>

357
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,660
<b>You knew everything and still kept your eyes on me?</b>

358
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:17,670
<b>So what? Are you going to arrest me now?</b>

359
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:21,740
<b>No, you're not the type to kill anyone.</b>

360
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:25,010
<b>What I've been doubting all this time though...</b>

361
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,510
<b>was a separate personality.</b>

362
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:32,750
<b>The evil personality that killed seven people in Shimbae City...</b>

363
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:34,520
<b>20 years ago.</b>

364
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,320
<b>What if that evil personality became the Eraser...</b>

365
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,790
<b>along with the help of an accomplice?</b>

366
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:42,790
<b>I don't have the energy for jokes.</b>

367
00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:46,600
<b>Every scenario hit a dead end and the possibility was close to zero.</b>

368
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,570
<b>Unless you used a trick that was beyond my comprehension, that is.</b>

369
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:52,100
<b>So?</b>

370
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:57,510
<b>I trust you.</b>

371
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:01,080
<b>Actually, it's my judgment I believe.</b>

372
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:04,810
<b>Is the interrogation over then?</b>

373
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:08,350
<b>For now.</b>

374
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:12,890
<b>I guess I should be grateful.</b>

375
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:17,430
<b>It's why we'll work together until we find the Eraser.</b>

376
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,440
<b>So all that's left is the incident at Shimbae.</b>

377
00:31:29,810 --> 00:31:32,870
<b>Someone other than me was at that warehouse.</b>

378
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,710
<b>Someone taller than 170cm.</b>

379
00:31:37,210 --> 00:31:39,380
<b>When he killed seven people that day,</b>

380
00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:41,520
<b>you were there as well.</b>

381
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:43,020
<b>Mom!</b>

382
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:45,350
<b>He then went on to kill your mother.</b>

383
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:49,460
<b>You lost your memories and ended up at Dongbaek Station.</b>

384
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,830
<b>Why was the Eraser called the young devil?</b>

385
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,730
<b>He was probably young.</b>

386
00:31:57,170 --> 00:31:59,900
<b>Moon Yong Gang was only 17 at the time as well.</b>

387
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:03,270
<b>You think Moon Yong Gang is the Eraser?</b>

388
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:06,010
<b>The Eraser is an enemy of your family...</b>

389
00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:07,640
<b>and he killed seven people.</b>

390
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:10,010
<b>Two months before the incident though,</b>

391
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:12,450
<b>Moon Yong Gang's brother was found murdered.</b>

392
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:15,650
<b>He killed the seven people to avenge his brother...</b>

393
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,350
<b>by becoming the Eraser?</b>

394
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:20,720
<b>He's at least an accomplice.</b>

395
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:22,260
<b>How's that?</b>

396
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:25,330
<b>Because if I were the Eraser, I wouldn't pass up on...</b>

397
00:32:25,330 --> 00:32:26,760
<b>Moon Yong Gang as a partner.</b>

398
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:28,460
<b>Just like he used Jin Jae Gyu.</b>

399
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:32,500
<b>Why did Moon Yong Gang inform us of Deputy Chief Lee?</b>

400
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,800
<b>Was it to fool us?</b>

401
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:39,170
<b>The Eraser is drawing a bigger picture,</b>

402
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:42,310
<b>but we don't even know whom he's ultimately after.</b>

403
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,710
<b>His ultimate goal?</b>

404
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:45,650
<b>The man who incited Lee Shin Woong.</b>

405
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,620
<b>There's an evil force that's been calling the shots...</b>

406
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:52,650
<b>and you think he's who the Eraser is ultimately after?</b>

407
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:56,590
<b>Then we have our answer. We either go after...</b>

408
00:32:56,590 --> 00:32:59,290
<b>Lee Shin Woong or Moon Yong Gang, the Eraser's accomplice.</b>

409
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,400
<b>Who first?</b>

410
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:03,030
<b>You should stay out of it. This is my job now.</b>

411
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,570
<b>- What? - You'll only end up dead.</b>

412
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:10,010
<b>Dr. Ahn and her big mouth.</b>

413
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:12,440
<b>My health is supposed to be top secret.</b>

414
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:15,080
<b>The doctor is too much of a worrywart.</b>

415
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:20,420
<b>Get some rest.</b>

416
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:22,820
<b>The phone isn't traceable, so keep it on at all times.</b>

417
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,750
<b>You'll pursue the case without me...</b>

418
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:28,520
<b>You'll only slow me down.</b>

419
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:34,300
<b>This is my war.</b>

420
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:36,570
<b>One that death can't even stop.</b>

421
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,200
<b>I found a lead.</b>

422
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,710
<b>There's someone helping Moon Yong Gang.</b>

423
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:47,680
<b>Who?</b>

424
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:50,950
<b>Hold on. That phone's being traced.</b>

425
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:52,050
<b>It's on flight mode.</b>

426
00:33:57,050 --> 00:33:58,350
<b>When did you record this?</b>

427
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:02,220
<b>- You'll end up dead. - Mr. Moon.</b>

428
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,460
<b>What seems off?</b>

429
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:08,330
<b>Please don't kill me.</b>

430
00:34:17,910 --> 00:34:18,970
<b>She moved first.</b>

431
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:39,230
<b>Yes, Ms. Han.</b>

432
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,560
<b>Old man, it's me.</b>

433
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:43,870
<b>Where on earth did you go? Ms. Han was worried sick.</b>

434
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:44,900
<b>Where's Seo Hui Soo?</b>

435
00:34:45,130 --> 00:34:46,430
<b>She's at Bang Joon Seok's residence.</b>

436
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:49,300
<b>We'll soon be there, so keep an eye on her. And Se Hoon?</b>

437
00:34:49,470 --> 00:34:50,710
<b>He's not here.</b>

438
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:53,840
<b>- Why not? - He's trying to save you.</b>

439
00:34:54,210 --> 00:34:55,280
<b>What do you mean?</b>

440
00:34:55,410 --> 00:34:58,480
<b>Isn't it obvious? He's trying to be a good partner.</b>

441
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,180
<b>(Despicable Serial Killer Suspect Dong Baek, Did He Fool the Nation?)</b>

442
00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:03,080
<b>I see it was published by my agency.</b>

443
00:35:07,090 --> 00:35:08,220
<b>You know it's not true.</b>

444
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,230
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

445
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:14,100
<b>All I'm asking for is the truth.</b>

446
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:17,500
<b>Just write about who Dong Baek truly is.</b>

447
00:35:18,970 --> 00:35:20,270
<b>I have nothing to say.</b>

448
00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:30,610
<b>Detective.</b>

449
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:40,620
<b>- The day I joined the force... - Thank you for the meal!</b>

450
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,260
<b>Enjoy, guys.</b>

451
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:44,290
<b>It's when I first met Dong Baek.</b>

452
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:49,160
<b>On days you need extra energy...</b>

453
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,230
<b>Here you go.</b>

454
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:51,830
<b>I got an odd feeling.</b>

455
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:53,870
<b>- This is amazing. - Tell me about it.</b>

456
00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:55,940
<b>What kind of feeling?</b>

457
00:35:57,310 --> 00:35:58,670
<b>He seemed lonely.</b>

458
00:36:00,310 --> 00:36:01,510
<b>What about the last one we had?</b>

459
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,720
<b>Salute!</b>

460
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:10,550
<b>It's an honor to meet you.</b>

461
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:12,320
<b>May I shake your hand?</b>

462
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:17,960
<b>Sure.</b>

463
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:25,400
<b>I'm Officer Oh Se Hoon.</b>

<b>Gosh.</b>

<b>Here. You can have it all.</b>

471

<b>Really? Thank you so much!</b>

472
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:09,080
<b>No one would let Baek by their side.</b>

473
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:14,650
<b>Still, he was loved by countless people.</b>

474
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:18,220
<b>Do you know why he thrives on people's attention?</b>

475
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:26,730
<b>It'd be a lie if I said he never liked it,</b>

476
00:37:30,370 --> 00:37:32,700
<b>but he needed it because of the criminals' memories.</b>

477
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:35,370
<b>The criminals?</b>

478
00:37:37,870 --> 00:37:39,470
<b>Because the evil memories...</b>

479
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:42,340
<b>never leave him...</b>

480
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,650
<b>once they enter his head.</b>

481
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:50,290
<b>The victims' pain and agony...</b>

482
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:54,590
<b>are somewhat consolidated once the culprit is caught.</b>

483
00:37:55,790 --> 00:37:58,760
<b>But that is not the case for the criminals' memories.</b>

484
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,260
<b>They become more vivid.</b>

485
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:06,530
<b>What got him through the torture every time...</b>

486
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:08,900
<b>was the people's love and support.</b>

487
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:11,710
<b>- Hello. - Gosh, you're here.</b>

488
00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:13,980
<b>- I'm Ji Min's father. - Oh, right.</b>

489
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:15,240
<b>Thank you so much.</b>

490
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:19,510
<b>If it weren't for you, Ji Min might not have made it.</b>

491
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:21,680
<b>Ji Min, go ahead and thank him.</b>

492
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:23,890
<b>- Thank you so much. - Thank you.</b>

493
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:26,120
<b>- I made these macarons for you. - I see.</b>

494
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:28,790
<b>- Thank you. - The tears of the ones he saved.</b>

495
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:30,860
<b>Thank you.</b>

496
00:38:32,290 --> 00:38:35,600
<b>The letters wrote by the bereaved families.</b>

497
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:42,400
<b>He may seem cocky and overly confident,</b>

498
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:48,510
<b>but he fought this battle by letting his heart get blackened.</b>

499
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:58,350
<b>I was called by the disciplinary committee too.</b>

500
00:38:59,890 --> 00:39:02,460
<b>But I honestly couldn't care less.</b>

501
00:39:03,790 --> 00:39:06,260
<b>How can I serve the people when I can't even protect my own partner?</b>

502
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:10,300
<b>If Dong Baek is thrown under the bus in any way,</b>

503
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:13,600
<b>I'll quit being a cop too.</b>

504
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:16,940
<b>I'll stay by his side...</b>

505
00:39:18,010 --> 00:39:19,970
<b>even if that costs me my badge.</b>

506
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,850
<b>Thank you for your time.</b>

507
00:39:59,610 --> 00:40:01,620
<b>Seo Hui Soo hasn't left Bang Joon Seok's house yet.</b>

508
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:03,590
<b>You couldn't find either Chun Ki Soo or Moon Yong Gang?</b>

509
00:40:03,890 --> 00:40:05,420
<b>I'll have to look again.</b>

510
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:07,990
<b>Actually, Metro is probably on it,</b>

511
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:10,830
<b>so focus on Lee Shin Woong's family first.</b>

512
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:12,560
<b>His family?</b>

513
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,630
<b>The Eraser has been targeting the family members...</b>

514
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:16,800
<b>of those involved in the Shimbae case.</b>

515
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,300
<b>He'll go after Deputy Chief Lee's family too.</b>

516
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:20,800
<b>What? Why?</b>

517
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,740
<b>He's the one who buried Moon Yong Dae's murder.</b>

518
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,540
<b>- Murder? - The seven who died...</b>

519
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:27,210
<b>in the warehouse were Moon Yong Dae's murderers.</b>

520
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:30,710
<b>- Are you sure? - Moon Yong Dae died...</b>

521
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:31,910
<b>just before the seven died.</b>

522
00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:34,720
<b>And there are commonalities between the incidents.</b>

523
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,120
<b>- Deputy Chief Lee? - No.</b>

524
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:38,190
<b>Chun Ki Soo.</b>

525
00:40:38,990 --> 00:40:40,860
<b>Chun Ki Soo bribed a doctor...</b>

526
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:43,890
<b>and made her declare Moon Yong Dae's death a suicide.</b>

527
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:47,430
<b>He buried the mass murder in the warehouse as well.</b>

528
00:40:48,430 --> 00:40:49,500
<b>My head's spinning.</b>

529
00:40:49,830 --> 00:40:52,270
<b>But that's not enough to connect him.</b>

530
00:40:52,270 --> 00:40:53,870
<b>The night the seven died,</b>

531
00:40:54,170 --> 00:40:56,470
<b>Deputy Chief Lee was being held captive in that warehouse.</b>

532
00:40:57,110 --> 00:40:59,840
<b>He was fated to be killed by the Eraser, but he escaped.</b>

533
00:41:00,010 --> 00:41:03,750
<b>Chun Ki Soo was disciplined for bribery 20 years ago,</b>

534
00:41:03,950 --> 00:41:07,020
<b>but he succeeded quickly and held high positions in HQ.</b>

535
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,820
<b>Deputy Chief Lee backed him.</b>

536
00:41:09,950 --> 00:41:11,490
<b>They're in this together.</b>

537
00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:15,290
<b>So, seven rich kids killed Moon Yong Dae,</b>

538
00:41:15,290 --> 00:41:17,560
<b>and Deputy Chief Lee had Chun Ki Soo cover it up.</b>

539
00:41:17,830 --> 00:41:20,090
<b>Moon Yong Gang, his brother, found out the truth,</b>

540
00:41:20,090 --> 00:41:22,560
<b>and killed all seven kids who killed his brother. But...</b>

541
00:41:23,330 --> 00:41:25,970
<b>that rage hasn't subsided even 20 years later,</b>

542
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,240
<b>so he became the Eraser...</b>

543
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:31,140
<b>and is harassing Deputy Chief Lee's and Chun Ki Soo's families.</b>

544
00:41:32,310 --> 00:41:35,510
<b>Even if Moon Yong Gang is not the Eraser, he's working with him.</b>

545
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:37,610
<b>Why do you want to meet Seo Hui Soo?</b>

546
00:41:37,810 --> 00:41:39,110
<b>We should catch Moon Yong Gang.</b>

547
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:42,850
<b>- It's a shortcut to catch him. - A shortcut?</b>

548
00:41:43,150 --> 00:41:45,390
<b>Take Se Hoon and go to Deputy Chief Lee's home.</b>

549
00:41:45,450 --> 00:41:47,320
<b>He'll show up near his family for sure.</b>

550
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:50,830
<b>Okay, yes, sir. Work hard.</b>

551
00:42:06,670 --> 00:42:07,880
<b>Where's Moon Yong Gang?</b>

552
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:11,150
<b>How would I...</b>

553
00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:22,160
<b>What are you doing? Put down the knife.</b>

554
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,260
<b>You moved first.</b>

555
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:31,930
<b>You stepped toward the stairs first, so that he could escape.</b>

556
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:36,840
<b>You're dating, aren't you?</b>

557
00:42:39,670 --> 00:42:40,780
<b>No, we're not.</b>

558
00:42:40,910 --> 00:42:42,910
<b>He used you.</b>

559
00:42:45,110 --> 00:42:46,180
<b>He did not.</b>

560
00:42:46,910 --> 00:42:48,150
<b>He's not like that.</b>

561
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:50,590
<b>Never.</b>

562
00:42:50,590 --> 00:42:52,020
<b>It was to commit murder.</b>

563
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:58,630
<b>You know something.</b>

564
00:42:59,790 --> 00:43:00,930
<b>What is it?</b>

565
00:43:03,430 --> 00:43:06,300
<b>Moon Yong Gang is attacking people to kill for his revenge.</b>

566
00:43:07,270 --> 00:43:08,770
<b>This is our only chance to stop him.</b>

567
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:10,470
<b>Where is he hiding?</b>

568
00:43:11,210 --> 00:43:12,510
<b>We don't have time.</b>

569
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:19,780
<b>The resort.</b>

570
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:21,950
<b>The resort?</b>

571
00:43:37,470 --> 00:43:40,540
<b>I beg you. Please save Yong Gang.</b>

572
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:42,500
<b>I'm begging you.</b>

573
00:43:57,650 --> 00:43:58,720
<b>Wait.</b>

574
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:04,830
<b>Put men behind like last time.</b>

575
00:44:05,590 --> 00:44:06,660
<b>They're Intelligence.</b>

576
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:10,130
<b>- Intelligence? - Lee Shin Woong's stooge.</b>

577
00:44:18,910 --> 00:44:20,270
<b>He's the one who took the photos...</b>

578
00:44:20,910 --> 00:44:22,140
<b>when I assaulted Choi Poong Won.</b>

579
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:26,080
<b>To get rid of you.</b>

580
00:44:27,250 --> 00:44:29,220
<b>He knew Moon Yong Gang was hiding here.</b>

581
00:44:39,290 --> 00:44:40,500
<b>No.</b>

582
00:44:42,230 --> 00:44:44,800
<b>Moon Yong Gang isn't here to hide.</b>

583
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:48,200
<b>He's here to kill his next target.</b>

584
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:03,920
<b>- What's the boundary situation? - We blocked the entire floor.</b>

585
00:45:04,190 --> 00:45:05,520
<b>- And the security office? - Four men are guarding it.</b>

586
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:07,490
<b>2 Intelligence agents and 2 security guards.</b>

587
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:09,520
<b>Double it.</b>

588
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:11,790
<b>Block external access to the security cameras.</b>

589
00:45:11,890 --> 00:45:14,230
<b>- It may be hacked. - Yes, sir.</b>

590
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:18,430
<b>Get off your phone.</b>

591
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:21,300
<b>Dad. I'm getting cabin fever.</b>

592
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:23,340
<b>What's going on?</b>

593
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:24,640
<b>Just a minute.</b>

594
00:45:26,110 --> 00:45:27,480
<b>(Restricted Number)</b>

595
00:45:29,740 --> 00:45:30,750
<b>Hello?</b>

596
00:45:30,750 --> 00:45:32,450
<b>The Eraser will target your family.</b>

597
00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:37,820
<b>What?</b>

598
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:39,790
<b>You're next since you bribed Chun Ki Soo.</b>

599
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:48,460
<b>Did Baek say that? That he'll kill me next?</b>

600
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:50,460
<b>You should work with us if you want to protect your family.</b>

601
00:45:51,370 --> 00:45:54,800
<b>Sun Mi. You don't get it yet, do you?</b>

602
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:57,540
<b>What the yardstick is for measuring...</b>

603
00:45:57,740 --> 00:45:59,510
<b>how properly a person has lived.</b>

604
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:05,850
<b>It's the depth of power they can get to help protect their people.</b>

605
00:46:07,950 --> 00:46:10,750
<b>I will protect my family.</b>

606
00:46:14,090 --> 00:46:15,220
<b>Sir.</b>

607
00:47:06,510 --> 00:47:07,780
<b>The Eraser will come here.</b>

608
00:47:13,250 --> 00:47:14,780
<b>He's the Eraser, so who?</b>

609
00:47:14,780 --> 00:47:16,480
<b>I see. His accomplice.</b>

610
00:47:18,150 --> 00:47:20,190
<b>Cuff him and lock him up next door.</b>

611
00:47:20,190 --> 00:47:21,920
<b>We'll interrogate him along with Moon Yong Gang.</b>

612
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:24,030
<b>- Yes, sir. - You'll regret it.</b>

613
00:47:24,990 --> 00:47:26,060
<b>The lights.</b>

614
00:47:29,830 --> 00:47:30,930
<b>What's going on out there?</b>

615
00:47:30,930 --> 00:47:31,970
<b>We're checking now.</b>

616
00:47:47,850 --> 00:47:48,980
<b>What's going on?</b>

617
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:51,820
<b>- He's here. - He's quicker than I expected.</b>

618
00:49:41,260 --> 00:49:42,900
<b>He prepared gas.</b>

619
00:49:43,530 --> 00:49:44,600
<b>"Gas"?</b>

620
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:46,200
<b>It's what doctors use for surgery.</b>

621
00:49:46,470 --> 00:49:47,640
<b>Sleeping gas.</b>

622
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:01,620
<b>Don't scan him!</b>

623
00:51:15,020 --> 00:51:16,120
<b>Baek.</b>

624
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:18,460
<b>Baek.</b>

625
00:51:19,130 --> 00:51:20,130
<b>Baek.</b>

626
00:51:21,130 --> 00:51:22,160
<b>Baek.</b>

627
00:51:24,330 --> 00:51:25,470
<b>Are you awake?</b>

628
00:51:30,870 --> 00:51:33,770
<b>What? What happened?</b>

629
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:36,710
<b>What do you think? I'll end up getting fired for this.</b>

630
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:39,310
<b>Captain Koo brought you guys here.</b>

631
00:51:53,590 --> 00:51:55,660
<b>Hey! Stop!</b>

632
00:51:56,100 --> 00:51:57,100
<b>Hey!</b>

633
00:51:57,100 --> 00:51:58,100
<b>What?</b>

634
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:04,470
<b>- You lost them? - Sorry, sir. I woke up too late.</b>

635
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:15,020
<b>What about Moon Yong Gang?</b>

636
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:17,180
<b>He's fine. The guys took him to the hospital.</b>

637
00:52:21,020 --> 00:52:22,820
<b>I want everyone on standby to work on this case.</b>

638
00:52:22,820 --> 00:52:24,660
<b>And tell the guys at the hospital to come back.</b>

639
00:52:25,030 --> 00:52:26,190
<b>Okay, sir.</b>

640
00:52:26,490 --> 00:52:29,430
<b>Let's start by interrogating Moon Yong Gang.</b>

641
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:30,530
<b>Got it, sir.</b>

642
00:52:35,070 --> 00:52:36,670
<b>They're not on the same side?</b>

643
00:52:40,610 --> 00:52:42,680
<b>No, let's reinforce security first.</b>

644
00:52:43,180 --> 00:52:44,210
<b>This is a trick.</b>

645
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:48,720
<b>We need to go back. Get in the car. Hurry!</b>

646
00:53:06,630 --> 00:53:07,840
<b>You should leave now.</b>

647
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:10,540
<b>Excuse me.</b>

648
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:15,640
<b>Excuse me.</b>

649
00:53:18,850 --> 00:53:19,910
<b>Sir?</b>

650
00:53:29,020 --> 00:53:30,120
<b>Don't move.</b>

651
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:56,350
<b>Where are you?</b>

652
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:58,590
<b>- Moon Yong Gang was bait. - What?</b>

653
00:53:58,620 --> 00:54:00,520
<b>The Eraser is going to kill your son!</b>

654
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:19,240
<b>No!</b>

655
00:54:37,890 --> 00:54:40,330
<b>Romeo got injured. Don't let anyone in or out of the building.</b>

656
00:54:40,490 --> 00:54:42,560
<b>The moment anyone sees the suspect, shoot him without hesitation.</b>

657
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:44,500
<b>- There will be no limits. - Baek.</b>

658
00:54:44,670 --> 00:54:47,840
<b>Use whatever violence you can to capture Dong Baek and the suspect.</b>

659
00:55:00,180 --> 00:55:01,250
<b>Will...</b>

660
00:55:02,780 --> 00:55:05,790
<b>Will our son be okay?</b>

661
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:09,820
<b>My goodness. Oh, gosh.</b>

662
00:55:26,310 --> 00:55:29,480
<b>He's still getting surgery, but the doctor says he'll live.</b>

663
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:32,750
<b>Fortunately, he missed the vital point.</b>

664
00:55:35,780 --> 00:55:36,780
<b>"Fortunately"?</b>

665
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:41,460
<b>He nailed 20 nails on my son's body.</b>

666
00:55:47,060 --> 00:55:48,260
<b>You think that's fortunate?</b>

667
00:55:51,930 --> 00:55:53,300
<b>If my son dies,</b>

668
00:55:55,570 --> 00:55:56,670
<b>you'll die as well.</b>

669
00:55:57,700 --> 00:55:58,870
<b>I swear on my life...</b>

670
00:55:59,710 --> 00:56:00,770
<b>that I'll catch him no matter what.</b>

671
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:11,820
<b>The culprit is someone else.</b>

672
00:56:15,790 --> 00:56:17,490
<b>The guys who killed Moon Yong Dae.</b>

673
00:56:26,630 --> 00:56:27,770
<b>There were more than seven.</b>

674
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:30,170
<b>There were eight guys in total.</b>

675
00:56:40,450 --> 00:56:41,780
<b>Bang Joon Seok.</b>

676
00:56:43,820 --> 00:56:45,250
<b>We finally solved the puzzle.</b>

677
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:57,970
<b>Ji Eun, what are you doing here?</b>

678
00:56:59,070 --> 00:57:00,330
<b>Are you deaf?</b>

679
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:04,340
<b>What's wrong with a reporter coming to the news department?</b>

680
00:57:05,010 --> 00:57:07,870
<b>I'm no longer going to take unreasonable orders from you.</b>

681
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:13,480
<b>What are you talking about? The country is in a mess.</b>

682
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:19,090
<b>I can't believe this.</b>

683
00:57:19,690 --> 00:57:21,690
<b>- What's going on? - This is crazy.</b>

684
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:23,760
<b>Is it the Eraser again?</b>

685
00:57:24,990 --> 00:57:26,230
<b>Is this for real?</b>

686
00:57:26,890 --> 00:57:29,600
<b>- I can't believe this is happening. - It's absurd.</b>

687
00:57:30,060 --> 00:57:31,230
<b>My goodness.</b>

688
00:57:52,350 --> 00:57:53,920
<b>Please wait here for a moment.</b>

689
00:58:01,130 --> 00:58:03,400
<b>Eun Soo Kyung, former congressman Bang Joon Seok's wife,</b>

690

<b>has been kidnapped by an unidentified assailant.</b>

691
00:58:06,030 --> 00:58:09,140
<b>The kidnapper sent us a photo of Eun Soo Kyung...</b>

692
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:11,940
<b>holding a message that seemed like a forewarning.</b>

693

<b>Reporter Gong Cheon Mi will be reporting to us exclusively.</b>

<b>Please.</b>

<b>I'm six months pregnant.</b>

<b>I don't care if I die.</b>

<b>But please don't hurt my baby.</b>

<b>Cho Won...</b>

<b>It's the name of my daughter's unborn child.</b>

<b>The Eraser's ultimate target.</b>

<b>Your son? We're just getting started.</b>
