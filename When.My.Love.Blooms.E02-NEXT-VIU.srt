1
00:00:16,184 --> 00:00:17,224
There you are.

2
00:00:21,594 --> 00:00:22,625
Yoon Ji Su.

3
00:00:27,665 --> 00:00:28,735
There you are.

4
00:00:30,404 --> 00:00:31,474
Yoon Ji Su.

5
00:00:55,095 --> 00:00:57,565
I should have found you sooner.

6
00:01:00,235 --> 00:01:01,364
I'm so late.

7
00:01:04,035 --> 00:01:05,834
You didn't find me.

8
00:01:07,274 --> 00:01:08,804
We ended it.

9
00:01:10,545 --> 00:01:12,414
How could I not look for you?

10
00:01:16,414 --> 00:01:18,884
Why did you go into hiding?

11
00:01:19,724 --> 00:01:21,254
I kind of understand,

12
00:01:22,054 --> 00:01:23,724
and I also resented it.

13
00:01:26,395 --> 00:01:27,925
Before I could do anything,

14
00:01:29,664 --> 00:01:31,765
we parted helplessly.

15
00:01:34,604 --> 00:01:37,575
It was as if I had a fishbone lodged in my throat.

16
00:01:40,905 --> 00:01:41,974
I'm sorry but...

17
00:01:44,045 --> 00:01:46,175
I don't remember the past much.

18
00:01:47,084 --> 00:01:48,214
To be honest,

19
00:01:50,015 --> 00:01:51,754
I don't have many memories of you.

20
00:01:54,485 --> 00:01:55,955
Thank you for dropping it.

21
00:01:57,024 --> 00:01:59,964
And I'm sorry your son was hurt.

22
00:02:01,094 --> 00:02:02,494
His name is Young Min?

23
00:02:05,665 --> 00:02:07,635
He seemed sweet and cute.

24
00:02:08,834 --> 00:02:11,735
I don't yet know why the two fought.

25
00:02:12,475 --> 00:02:15,374
There's nothing to be sorry about...

26
00:02:18,015 --> 00:02:19,374
or grateful.

27
00:02:19,714 --> 00:02:20,814
Anyway,

28
00:02:22,344 --> 00:02:24,985
thank you. I should go.

(Hwabon Station)

32
00:03:07,524 --> 00:03:09,934
Even a senior you don't have many memories of...

33
00:03:10,864 --> 00:03:12,534
will be a useful guide.

34
00:03:14,034 --> 00:03:15,934
I helped at many rural communities.

35
00:03:15,934 --> 00:03:17,735
I know my way around countrysides like this.

36
00:03:54,344 --> 00:03:55,744
- Who's there? - My gosh!

37
00:04:09,755 --> 00:04:11,424
I won't ask you to hold my hand.

38
00:04:11,424 --> 00:04:12,724
Just stay close.

39
00:04:14,594 --> 00:04:15,924
It's okay.

40
00:04:18,495 --> 00:04:19,594
Okay then.

41
00:04:20,305 --> 00:04:22,904
Don't lose me. Follow my footsteps.

42
00:04:38,214 --> 00:04:39,584
Don't lose me.

43
00:04:41,354 --> 00:04:42,685
Don't look anywhere else.

44
00:04:44,024 --> 00:04:45,255
Follow my footsteps.

C sharp minor. 9. 9, 9.

B7 and 13. Teen, teen.

47
00:06:23,724 --> 00:06:25,195
Teen.

48
00:06:25,755 --> 00:06:28,524
What, is this math or music?

49
00:06:33,705 --> 00:06:37,834

I'd love to give that a try

The only person I can page is Lee Dong Jin

62
00:07:55,784 --> 00:07:59,214
- I'm ruined - Why are you still here?

63
00:08:01,455 --> 00:08:02,755
My gosh.

64
00:08:02,755 --> 00:08:04,654
Why are your eyes closed?

65
00:08:04,895 --> 00:08:07,224
You're such a joke, you are.

(GMAT Special Lecture by Kim Gi Hwan)

67
00:08:10,294 --> 00:08:11,664
I think that's mine.

68
00:08:27,345 --> 00:08:28,515
There you are.

69
00:08:29,985 --> 00:08:31,085
Yoon Ji Su.

70
00:08:41,194 --> 00:08:44,064
You know my name?

71
00:08:45,564 --> 00:08:47,835
It was in huge letters on your sheet music.

72
00:08:48,404 --> 00:08:51,404
Oh. You remembered.

73
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:55,544
That handkerchief was expensive.

74
00:08:58,645 --> 00:09:00,814
It doesn't look too expensive.

75
00:09:00,985 --> 00:09:02,784
My mother's gift when I started university.

76
00:09:03,755 --> 00:09:05,154
Oh, I'm sorry.

77
00:09:05,385 --> 00:09:07,554
I meant to return it.

78
00:09:07,924 --> 00:09:09,225
No, you keep it.

79
00:09:09,654 --> 00:09:10,755
Why?

80
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:13,965
Your snot and hair grease. It's dirty.

81
00:09:13,965 --> 00:09:16,865
I didn't tie my hair with it. You called before I could.

82
00:09:17,534 --> 00:09:20,505
And I can't keep your mother's gift.

83
00:09:20,505 --> 00:09:22,265
I have five more. It was a set.

84
00:09:23,235 --> 00:09:26,274
So stop hanging around my society...

85
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:27,475
and study.

86
00:09:28,245 --> 00:09:29,875
No one studies.

87
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:31,845
- What? - The seniors protest...

88
00:09:31,845 --> 00:09:33,645
and freshmen get drunk.

89
00:09:33,814 --> 00:09:35,245
No one studies.

90
00:09:37,215 --> 00:09:38,885
You learned all the bad things.

91
00:09:40,054 --> 00:09:41,654
We study really hard.

92
00:09:41,855 --> 00:09:43,284
We read and debate every day.

93
00:09:43,284 --> 00:09:45,855
If I study hard, will you date me?

94
00:09:56,465 --> 00:09:57,635
No... No.

95
00:10:00,105 --> 00:10:01,444
Your cassette tape.

96
00:10:04,574 --> 00:10:07,044
You dropped it on the grass.

97
00:10:08,444 --> 00:10:10,044
I didn't listen to it.

98
00:10:10,255 --> 00:10:11,355
Hand it over.

99
00:10:14,054 --> 00:10:17,225
If the chord's too hard, can't you just change the note?

100
00:10:22,924 --> 00:10:24,034
Forget it.

101
00:10:24,235 --> 00:10:25,635
I memorized it.

102
00:10:27,465 --> 00:10:28,704
Still, forget it.

103
00:10:28,804 --> 00:10:30,135
I don't want to.

104
00:10:30,774 --> 00:10:32,235
The song's nice,

105
00:10:32,404 --> 00:10:34,574
and you're even nicer.

106
00:10:35,544 --> 00:10:37,774
I realize that you're just another person,

107
00:10:38,044 --> 00:10:39,975
and unlike when you protest,

108
00:10:40,385 --> 00:10:41,885
you're quite cute.

109
00:10:41,885 --> 00:10:42,985
You...

110
00:10:44,215 --> 00:10:45,985
Don't show that you know me.

111
00:11:03,674 --> 00:11:05,235
As if she doesn't remember.

112
00:11:05,835 --> 00:11:08,774
She kept my handkerchief for over 20 years.

113
00:11:19,015 --> 00:11:20,684
As if I don't remember.

114
00:11:23,154 --> 00:11:25,225
I even remember the song.

115
00:11:31,265 --> 00:11:33,564
Love

116
00:11:34,304 --> 00:11:35,965
And dating

117
00:11:36,835 --> 00:11:39,475
I'd love to give that a try

118
00:11:41,605 --> 00:11:43,745
The only person

119
00:11:44,475 --> 00:11:46,274
I can page

120
00:11:46,615 --> 00:11:50,684
is Lee Dong Jin

(Bed and Breakfast)

122
00:12:54,284 --> 00:12:56,044
She still sweeps with her foot.

123
00:13:18,534 --> 00:13:20,904
Young lady, take this.

124
00:13:21,044 --> 00:13:22,674
It's your breakfast.

125
00:13:22,674 --> 00:13:24,814
I put some rice water on the boil.

126
00:13:25,115 --> 00:13:26,274
Take this.

127
00:13:38,454 --> 00:13:41,725
The rice water tastes really nice today.

128
00:13:49,304 --> 00:13:51,005
Are you two just dating?

129
00:13:52,235 --> 00:13:55,174
If you're married, you wouldn't take separate rooms.

130
00:13:55,674 --> 00:13:57,375
Even more so if this is an affair.

131
00:14:00,314 --> 00:14:02,645
It's neither. We're just friends.

132
00:14:02,645 --> 00:14:04,054
What a joke.

133
00:14:04,054 --> 00:14:06,115
Men and women can't be friends.

134
00:14:06,115 --> 00:14:08,524
Why not? Friendship can cross genders.

135
00:14:09,855 --> 00:14:11,895
How do you know so much?

136
00:14:11,895 --> 00:14:12,995
Those special terms.

137
00:14:12,995 --> 00:14:16,664
I watch a drama every day before I watch the 9pm news.

138
00:14:16,794 --> 00:14:18,235
That's all they talk about.

139
00:14:18,235 --> 00:14:20,605
People slap each other over affairs,

140
00:14:20,605 --> 00:14:23,835
and sometimes they even fling kimchi.

141
00:14:24,404 --> 00:14:27,005
Gosh, it's such a sight.

142
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:43,725
I hope it snows some more.

143
00:14:45,255 --> 00:14:46,495
So we get stuck here.

144
00:14:59,074 --> 00:15:01,304
Can I take a look?

145
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:07,444
Let me see.

146
00:15:25,135 --> 00:15:26,194
Hold this.

147
00:15:41,845 --> 00:15:42,914
It won't come out.

148
00:15:46,554 --> 00:15:48,924
- It's fine now. - I'm almost done.

149
00:15:55,924 --> 00:15:56,965
It came out.

150
00:16:21,684 --> 00:16:23,725
Isn't your family worried?

151
00:16:24,855 --> 00:16:27,564
They said it's fine. To take my time.

152
00:16:29,024 --> 00:16:30,064
Good.

153
00:16:32,034 --> 00:16:34,765
From what I saw of your kid, his dad must be a nice man.

154
00:16:35,335 --> 00:16:37,064
Can I ask what he does?

155
00:16:38,475 --> 00:16:39,605
He's a lawyer.

156
00:16:41,145 --> 00:16:42,204
Is he?

157
00:16:43,145 --> 00:16:45,044
Then he must've studied law like me.

158
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:46,774
Was he from our university?

159
00:16:53,885 --> 00:16:54,885
Jae Hyun.

160
00:16:59,424 --> 00:17:01,125
These conversations make me uncomfortable.

161
00:17:03,395 --> 00:17:05,234
Thank you for yesterday and today,

162
00:17:05,865 --> 00:17:07,764
and if I owe you, I'll pay you.

163
00:17:08,335 --> 00:17:09,504
That's all.

164
00:17:10,734 --> 00:17:13,504
I want to deal with it as parents of two classmates.

165
00:17:16,404 --> 00:17:18,115
I feel uncomfortable listening to...

166
00:17:18,115 --> 00:17:19,414
old stories I barely remember.

167
00:17:20,845 --> 00:17:23,484
Okay. I understand.

168
00:17:25,315 --> 00:17:28,555
The sun's up now, so let's each go our own way.

169
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:18,480
Welcome back, sir.

170
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:20,910
I'll take you home,

171
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:22,910
then go back for your car.

172
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:54,950
- Hey, Jae Hyun. - Hey.

173
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:57,850
How much do lawyers make?

174
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:00,580
- Do you want to become one? - No.

175
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:04,320
Is it tough to make a living?

176
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:07,090
It depends on the lawyer.

177
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:11,000
A civil-rights lawyer or a public defender...

178
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:13,660
could struggle financially, right?

179
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:16,570
Hey, are you getting fired? Does the old man want you gone?

180
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:19,740
I gave you some detailed advice...

181
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:21,310
to put away some cash.

182
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:23,570
You jerk. Thanks anyway.

183
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:50,200
- Jun Woo. - Yes?

184
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:52,570
The person who dropped this handkerchief.

185
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:55,070
You had that.

186
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,710
I was going to throw it away.

187
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,940
What did it look like the woman did?

188
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:01,010
I don't know.

189
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:03,080
She had a bag full of 500ml water bottles.

190
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:04,920
Does she sell them?

191
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:07,350
Anyway, you know the typical middle-aged woman.

192
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:09,520
Relentless and thick-faced.

193
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,260
She was pretty though.

194
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:13,390
I bet she was popular back in the day.

195
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:16,130
- Find out about her. - Pardon?

196
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,630
Come on, sir.

197
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,770
Because she's pretty?

198
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:23,870
You almost hit her in the street...

199
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:25,140
and you want to ignore that?

200
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,900
What human does that?

201
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,610
- Is that how I taught you? - No, sir.

202
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:33,010
I know nothing about her.

203
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:35,410
- I do. - Pardon?

204
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:37,250
Her child goes to Jun Seo's school.

205
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:38,650
What? Really?

206
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:46,490
(Convalescent Ward)

207
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:50,660
(Homeroom Teacher)

208
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:52,400
I keep asking Young Min,

209
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:55,100
but he won't say what happened.

210
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,310
Young Min won't say.

211
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,650
The meek and sweet little boy...

212
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:15,650
threw a chair at a kid.

213
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,190
And I completely forgot about that.

214
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,730
From last night until now.

215
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:29,070
I'm a bad mom, aren't I?

216
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:37,840
It snowed.

217
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:42,880
It snowed a lot. Maybe that's why.

218
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:48,250
This season thing really gets to me.

219
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,830
I wish there were only one season,

220
00:22:55,890 --> 00:22:57,360
but there are four.

221
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:02,630
Each one of them is pretty and heart-fluttering.

222
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:07,500
They come hand-in-hand with him.

223
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:11,780
On some days, he comes with the wind.

224
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,010
On some days, he comes with the flowers.

225
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:18,280
On some days, he comes with the rain.

226
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:27,520
When I close my eyes not to see him, I can remember him more vividly.

227
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:31,330
When I drink because I feel so miserable,

228
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,530
he shows up in my dream without a warning.

229
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:38,970
He shows up every single day even when I don't do anything,

230
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:41,410
so I couldn't live my life.

231
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:49,780
No.

232
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,350
Actually,

233
00:23:57,690 --> 00:23:59,760
I could live because of his memories.

234
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:10,900
I imagined us meeting again over hundreds of times.

235
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,010
But what happened yesterday...

236
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:17,370
wasn't in any of the scenarios I thought of.

237
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:23,380
Why did we have to meet again...

238
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:27,080
when I was the most pathetic and miserable?

239
00:24:56,910 --> 00:24:58,980
They are my wife...

240
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:01,050
and my daughter.

241
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:04,050
Aren't they beautiful?

242
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:19,670
But it was nice seeing Jae Hyun again.

243
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:24,370
That's why I can understand...

244
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:26,340
how much pain you must be in, Dad.

245
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:53,000
Sir, your wife is home.

246
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,350
Can we talk?

247
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:15,960
Do you run a charity?

248
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:19,030
I thought you already donated enough of your money.

249
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:20,260
What's your point?

250
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:22,570
Who told you we would let this incident slide?

251
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:24,800
Who said you could let that kid off the hook?

252
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:27,700
Should I have put him in prison or something?

253
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:30,370
Of course. He attacked our son.

254
00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:31,740
It's nothing serious.

255
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,240
And he's still a kid.

256
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,210
It's worse because he's only a kid.

257
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:38,950
He's already violent toward other kids at that age.

258
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:41,150
What if his aim was better and the chair hit our son?

259
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:43,020
Didn't you think about that?

260
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:44,790
Check on Jun Seo first.

261
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,620
See if he made any mistakes.

262
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:48,560
Even if he did, that doesn't matter!

263
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:50,090
I'm already annoyed...

264
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:52,600
that he's going to school with my son for free.

265
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:54,830
We'll settle this? We won't press charges?

266
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,930
That will never happen!

267
00:26:57,130 --> 00:27:00,000
If you do this, you'll only ruin our son.

268
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,710
I heard a few things about the incident,

269
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:03,740
so don't dismiss my decision.

270
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,360
Can we talk?

271
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:33,900
I don't like beating around the bush. I'll cut to the chase.

272
00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:36,470
I want you to resign your position as the chairperson of our committee.

273
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,610
It won't be pretty if we object.

274
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:41,750
I want you to tell the school that you'll resign.

275
00:27:43,810 --> 00:27:45,650
I didn't take the position because I wanted to,

276
00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:47,420
so I can tell the school I'll resign,

277
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,720
but may I ask you why?

278
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:51,560
I heard about Young Min.

279
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:54,160
Well, it's not just about him.

280
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:57,430
The problem is you.

281
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:01,060
You lied to us more than I can count.

282
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,300
You're divorced.

283
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:06,070
I guess you don't need to disclose that since it's your personal life.

284
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:08,670
But you're working at a supermarket.

285
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:10,370
That's a bit appalling, you know.

286
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:14,210
Another parent saw you doing a protest in front...

287
00:28:14,210 --> 00:28:15,980
of the supermarket headquarters.

288
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:17,310
Was she wrong?

289
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:19,620
Must I disclose my personal life...

290
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:21,920
to you?

291
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:24,420
You shouldn't have deceived us at least.

292
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:28,230
I'm sorry if you felt I deceived you.

293
00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:31,700
I didn't want to tell you because I didn't want you...

294
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:33,730
to judge my son based on my decision.

295
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,800
Let's be honest. Weren't you embarrassed to tell us?

296
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,770
You already knew that you wouldn't...

297
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:41,270
be able to socialize with us.

298
00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:46,480
That part is true.

299
00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:49,510
Dealing with school stuff and eating brunch at the hotel was too much.

300
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,320
This all worked out. I'll tell the school.

301
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:55,020
Unbelievable. How could you be so brazen?

302
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:56,020
Aren't you going to apologize?

303
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:57,620
You must have forgotten already.

304
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:59,290
I already did 30 seconds again.

305
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:15,170
(Lee Se Hun)

306
00:29:22,610 --> 00:29:23,880
What is it?

307
00:29:27,050 --> 00:29:28,920
Tell me what you couldn't tell me on the phone.

308
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:32,860
This is rude. You didn't even knock.

309
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:35,430
I keep my manners only to humans.

310
00:29:38,530 --> 00:29:41,160
Did something happen to Young Min?

311
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,070
No.

312
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,440
Really?

313
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:48,170
- Nothing happened. - That's odd.

314
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,870
Why is his cell phone turned off then?

315
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:52,140
It's been off for two days.

316
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,110
Didn't you call him?

317
00:29:57,810 --> 00:29:59,420
He called me with his friend's phone.

318
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:01,150
He said his phone was broken.

319
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:03,720
I see. Is that so?

320
00:30:05,690 --> 00:30:08,290
If this is it, you should tell me on the phone.

321
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:11,430
I can't see your eyes on the phone.

322
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,730
Our eyes can't lie.

323
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:22,810
I will never come to your office again.

324
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:25,440
You should try to find a way to tell if I'm lying or not...

325
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,040
through my voice.

326
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:45,300
If you settle, your charge can get acquitted.

327
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:49,130
I won't settle.

328
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:54,200
If the court accepts you did this on purpose, you'll serve time...

329
00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:56,370
when you shouldn't serve time.

330
00:30:56,810 --> 00:30:59,980
It was neither an accident nor done in the heat of the moment.

331
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,580
He mocked the accident...

332
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:04,510
and ridiculed my bereaved family.

333
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:07,020
He didn't show any signs of remorse or repentance.

334
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:10,120
I...

335
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:12,990
intended to do it.

336
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:18,200
I'm going to tell the world...

337
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,360

- Wake up! - Wake up!

00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:11,850
Hey.

348
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:16,550
It's about the woman you wanted me to look into.

349
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:18,720
Yes. What did you find out about her?

350
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:20,820
She's divorced.

351
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:21,990
She's divorced?

352
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:23,390
Yes, three years ago.

353
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:26,030
That can't be right.

354
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:28,370
As of now, it's just her and her son on her family register.

355
00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:30,600
Does it mean she's raising her son alone?

356
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,270
Yes, it seems like it.

357
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:35,310
Then, what about her ex-husband?

358
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,670
Is he paying her alimony?

359
00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:39,540
He's a lawyer at a law firm.

360
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,110
They had a divorce lawsuit.

361
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:42,910
In exchange for getting the custody of their son,

362
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:45,280
she gave up on receiving alimony and child support.

363
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,620
How does she get by?

364
00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:48,290
Does she have a job?

365
00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:50,320
No, not really.

366
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,690
It looks like she has a few part-time jobs.

367
00:32:56,530 --> 00:32:59,160
(Make sure to turn on your headlights.)

368
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:33,200
Yes, hello.

369
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:35,800
Ms. Yoon. You called me earlier.

370
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:39,340
Yes. Young Min's cell phone is turned off.

371
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:41,200
I was worried if something happened to him.

372
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:44,170
No, nothing happened. He was in all of his classes.

373
00:33:44,610 --> 00:33:45,610
Really?

374
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:48,950
I'll tell Young Min to call you.

375
00:33:50,010 --> 00:33:52,380
Okay. Please tell him to call him.

376
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:54,250
And...

377
00:33:55,290 --> 00:33:57,190
there's one more favor I wanted to ask you.

378
00:33:57,390 --> 00:33:58,620
Sure, go ahead.

379
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:03,060
If his father calls,

380
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:06,500
could you not tell him about the incident?

381
00:34:10,170 --> 00:34:11,470
I don't want him to worry.

382
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:14,970
Okay. Thank you.

383
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:38,960
What is it? Did I annoy you?

384
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:44,530
I must have lost my mind when I hurt my head.

385
00:34:45,570 --> 00:34:48,140
It's because of you, so I hope you understand.

And you must quickly decide what you plan to do...

393
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:41,660
with the temporary employees who have been protesting...

394
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:43,430
for over a month now.

395
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:46,300
What do you think I should do, Mr. Park?

396
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:49,200
We didn't violate the contract.

397
00:35:49,570 --> 00:35:53,170
But they are arguing that the contract itself was unfair.

398
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,610
- I want us to stick to the law. - Put yourself in their shoes.

399
00:35:57,210 --> 00:36:00,110
Most of them are housewives in their 40s and 50s.

400
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:03,680
If we just terminate them at this day and age, they will...

401
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:06,020
start petitioning and cause quite a mess.

402
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:08,220
Then, what do you suggest that we do?

403
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:10,050
Just let them be.

404
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:13,920
It looked like they were having fun. It's like they're on a picnic.

405
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:17,130
Do you think they'll break down the door and barge in here?

406
00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:18,860
Right.

407
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,500
Talk to the legal team...

408
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:22,370
and bring me a plan.

409
00:36:22,570 --> 00:36:25,600
Don't ask me questions like you're giving me a quiz.

410
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:27,700
Okay.

411
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:29,710
We'll pretend to negotiate the terms and stall time.

412
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:31,570
And they'll be forced to disband.

413
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,710
Illegal labor disputes, occupying our building without permission,

414

obstruction of business, and so on.

415
00:36:36,810 --> 00:36:40,150
Gather all the evidence that could forcefully remove them.

416
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:42,220
Yes, sir.

417
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:04,710
By the way, why aren't you getting married?

418
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,880
Wait, did you already get married once?

419
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:12,350
I can't believe no one made a move on such a handsome man like you.

420
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:14,750
- No way. - I'm sure he had a girlfriend.

421
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:17,750
You couldn't choose because you had too many, right?

422
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:20,060
I liked a girl,

423
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:22,960
but she didn't know for 25 years...

424
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:25,500
because she's like a horse at the racecourse.

425
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,800
Well, it's not that bad.

426
00:37:31,530 --> 00:37:32,600
She won't...

427
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,270
at least tell me she wants to break up.

428
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:39,880
Hey.

429
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:48,250
Let's go.

430
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,090
You should sit here.

431
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:55,360
- Pardon? - We finished our drinks.

432
00:37:56,530 --> 00:37:58,030
- But you didn't. - Have a good day.

433
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:00,030
- Let's go. - Good luck.

434

Good luck.

435
00:38:07,970 --> 00:38:09,170
What do they mean by that?

436
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:11,640
They want me to have a busy night.

437
00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:16,050
Is it obvious that I drink a lot?

438
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:17,150
A bit.

439
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:20,120
I think I smell alcohol from you too.

440
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:21,150

Yes, I need to give something to him.

Give me that. I'll give it to him.

What kind of club is it?

452
00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:06,430
Solidarity of Philosophy. It's a philosophy club.

00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,260
What a name.

454
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:09,670
The name is a bit pretentious,

455
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:11,430
but we just study philosophy there.

456
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:12,800
I don't know much about philosophy.

457
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,500
We don't know much either.

458

That's why we meet up and study.

so he attends the seminar every week.

463

Then, what kind of book does he buy?

00:43:50,030 --> 00:43:52,190
At times when the waiting grows longer

502
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:55,400
I can not help but resent you

503
00:43:58,070 --> 00:44:01,170
Cirrus clouds float through the dark skies

504
00:44:02,810 --> 00:44:04,240
What song shall I have to sing

505
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:06,580
In order for it to reach your ears?

506
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:10,650
We never met, so we shall never part

507
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:14,120
Yet we can not hold hands, though we never parted

508
00:44:15,790 --> 00:44:17,820
So as the waiting grows longer

509
00:44:18,550 --> 00:44:20,690
I can not help but resent you more

510
00:44:20,690 --> 00:44:22,630
(I can not help but resent you more)

511
00:45:30,690 --> 00:45:31,990
Is something wrong?

512
00:45:34,230 --> 00:45:35,560
What is it?

513
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:40,470
I'm trying to decide...

514
00:45:42,810 --> 00:45:44,570
what to tell you first.

515
00:45:49,510 --> 00:45:50,850
I've decided.

516
00:45:51,250 --> 00:45:52,350
Hurry up.

517
00:45:55,790 --> 00:45:57,720
Young Min will be back in two days,

518
00:45:58,090 --> 00:45:59,890
and I still haven't gone grocery shopping.

519
00:46:01,090 --> 00:46:02,430
Come on, you...

520
00:46:03,130 --> 00:46:05,130
I should go before they close.

521
00:46:24,110 --> 00:46:26,580
She hasn't changed a bit.

522
00:46:27,350 --> 00:46:30,320
Why isn't she wearing any gloves?

523
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:33,660
And her jacket is too thin.

524
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:36,890
(3 Ice creams for 1 dollar, Soda for 1.5 dollars)

525
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:41,460
Goodness.

526
00:46:42,770 --> 00:46:44,030
Who is this for?

527
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:45,630
It's for me.

528
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:47,900
Gosh, why?

529
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:50,710
Why would a lady need to drink that much?

530
00:46:52,010 --> 00:46:53,280
Then what am I supposed to do?

531
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:54,340
Do what?

532
00:46:54,340 --> 00:46:56,310
I already have a hard time falling asleep,

533
00:46:57,180 --> 00:46:59,050
and now it's going to get worse.

534
00:46:59,450 --> 00:47:00,520
Why?

535
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:03,020
I shouldn't be acting like this.

536
00:47:03,690 --> 00:47:06,520
I need to get a grip, but it keeps coming back to me.

537
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:10,630
It's driving me crazy!

538
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:47,900
Where are you?

539
00:47:48,030 --> 00:47:50,030
Did you fall in a well or something?

540
00:47:50,030 --> 00:47:52,740
Why aren't you back? Why?

541
00:47:52,940 --> 00:47:55,200
Hurry up, already!

542
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:04,450
Thank you.

543
00:48:07,750 --> 00:48:09,620
Here. Oh, gosh.

544
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:15,520
I'll help you take this to the door.

545
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:16,730
No, it's all right.

546
00:48:16,730 --> 00:48:17,990
This is heavy.

547
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:22,570
Oh, thank you.

548
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:24,270
No problem.

549
00:48:24,270 --> 00:48:27,440
Have we met before?

550
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:29,970
I have a common-looking face, so I'm used to that.

551
00:48:29,970 --> 00:48:31,670
You don't look so common.

552
00:48:32,140 --> 00:48:34,410
Oh, really?

553
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:38,350
I wonder why everyone says so. That's odd.

554
00:48:41,950 --> 00:48:43,690
Goodbye, then.

555
00:48:59,070 --> 00:49:00,770
- Good job. - No problem, sir.

556
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:03,710
She went inside. Should we go?

557
00:49:05,270 --> 00:49:06,810
- Yes, let's go. - All right.

558
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:11,210
May I ask how you know her?

559
00:49:11,210 --> 00:49:12,650
No, you may not.

560
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:13,950
Yes, sir.

561
00:49:14,780 --> 00:49:16,720
- Hey, Jun Woo. - Yes, sir?

562
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:18,720
Could you come straight here in the morning...

563
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:20,090
for a few days?

564
00:49:20,890 --> 00:49:22,590
- Sorry? - See where she's headed...

565
00:49:22,590 --> 00:49:24,090
and what she's doing.

566
00:49:25,690 --> 00:49:26,800
Yes, sir.

567
00:49:27,830 --> 00:49:29,800
It's not stalking, and it's not a crime.

568
00:49:30,030 --> 00:49:32,700
Just think of it as good will.

569
00:49:32,870 --> 00:49:34,100
All right, sir.

570
00:49:37,610 --> 00:49:38,910
I know her from college.

571
00:49:39,710 --> 00:49:41,580
She was a nice, smart kid.

572
00:49:58,660 --> 00:50:01,300
(To Jae Hyun)

573
00:50:45,570 --> 00:50:47,880
(Thanks to those moments that were as pretty as flowers,)

574
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:49,880
(I think I can go on. Sorry and thank you. Jae Hyun.)

575
00:51:44,730 --> 00:51:47,070
These are the gloves you were looking for, sir.

576
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:49,170
They are all new this season.

577
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:50,440
Okay.

578
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:52,540
Are they for your wife?

579
00:51:52,710 --> 00:51:53,880
No.

580
00:51:54,010 --> 00:51:56,150
Oh... All right, sir.

581
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:58,510
You don't have to tell her, either.

582
00:51:59,050 --> 00:52:00,880
Of course, sir.

583
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:02,320
I'll take these.

584
00:52:03,590 --> 00:52:04,650
Yes, sir.

585
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:16,230
Yes?

586
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:17,630
Mr. Han.

587
00:52:17,630 --> 00:52:19,170
Are you doing your job?

588
00:52:19,170 --> 00:52:20,400
I am, but...

589
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:21,640
Ms. Yoon is...

590
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:22,740
Is what?

591
00:52:23,210 --> 00:52:25,010
She's at the office, sir.

592
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:26,240
What?

593
00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:29,180
(Cancel the unfair dismissal!)

594
00:52:32,110 --> 00:52:35,350
Young Min, how long are you going to keep ignoring my messages?

595
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:37,850
This is foul play.

596
00:52:46,330 --> 00:52:48,730
(Cancel the unfair dismissal! Murderous Company, Hyung Sung Group)

597
00:52:50,730 --> 00:52:52,370
Should we keep watch?

598
00:52:52,940 --> 00:52:54,200
Forget it.

599
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:55,470
Yes, sir.

600
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:58,070
Good will, my foot. This is stalking.

601
00:52:59,980 --> 00:53:01,780
I'm sorry for asking you to do this.

602
00:53:01,780 --> 00:53:03,650
It's nothing, sir.

603
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:08,750
Should I cancel the meeting you had today?

604
00:53:08,750 --> 00:53:11,020
- What meeting? - With the head of Seoul Bank.

605
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:15,120
- I still have to work. - Yes, sir.

606
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:27,940
You're right.

607
00:53:30,570 --> 00:53:31,870
"Three handsome sons-in-law..."

608
00:53:31,870 --> 00:53:33,710
"of conglomerate families everyone wants to date..."

609
00:53:34,110 --> 00:53:35,410
Whatever.

610
00:53:35,780 --> 00:53:37,680
He has a great figure. He could be an actor.

611
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:40,180
He's still young, and he's already a vice-president.

612
00:53:40,180 --> 00:53:42,550
- Haven't you heard? - What?

613
00:53:43,150 --> 00:53:45,420
He's Jang Seo Kyung's husband.

614
00:53:45,450 --> 00:53:48,390
- Jang Seo Kyung. - You're right!

615
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:51,230
The chairman was against the marriage,

616
00:53:51,530 --> 00:53:54,960
but Jang Seo Kyung caused a fit...

617
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:56,400
and managed to make it work.

618
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:59,500
He went to jail for the chairman and recently got discharged.

619
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:00,940
- Really? - Let me see.

620
00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:02,870
- It says so here. - Give it!

621
00:54:02,870 --> 00:54:04,640
- Where? - Let go!

622
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:06,580
- Gosh, what's wrong with you? - That hurt!

623
00:54:06,580 --> 00:54:07,910
- I couldn't see. - Goodness!

624
00:54:07,910 --> 00:54:10,280
- You could've waited your turn! - Gosh!

625
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:17,390
(Three handsome sons-in-law of conglomerate families...)

626
00:54:17,390 --> 00:54:19,590
(everyone wants to date, Han Jae Hyun of Hyung Sung Group)

627
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:28,160
(The marriage between the chairman's daughter and a mere employee)

628
00:54:51,690 --> 00:54:53,860
I will never agree on a settlement.

629
00:54:54,490 --> 00:54:56,830
Set up the School Violence Committee.

630
00:54:57,260 --> 00:54:58,290
But...

631
00:54:58,930 --> 00:55:00,960
Mr. Han said to never allow...

632
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:04,170
And you should have stopped him.

633
00:55:04,330 --> 00:55:06,640
Even if it were Jun Seo's grandfather who came,

634
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:09,100
- you should've stopped it. - I'm sorry, ma'am.

635
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:12,310
I did tell him that we can't do that,

636
00:55:12,770 --> 00:55:14,610
but he insisted, saying he's a young boy.

637
00:55:14,610 --> 00:55:16,850
I don't want you to misunderstand me.

638
00:55:17,010 --> 00:55:19,210
Even if my son wasn't the victim,

639
00:55:19,210 --> 00:55:21,320
I would've wanted you to go by the rules.

640
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:22,950
If we just let this pass,

641
00:55:22,950 --> 00:55:25,150
it will only humiliate the school.

642
00:55:26,390 --> 00:55:28,590
This school should be special, don't you think?

643
00:55:29,090 --> 00:55:30,760
Isn't that why parents...

644
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:33,860
want to send their kids here at all costs?

645
00:55:36,030 --> 00:55:39,640
And it's also why I make such large donations here.

646
00:55:49,580 --> 00:55:51,580
(Han Jae Hyun of Hyung Sung Group)

647
00:55:51,580 --> 00:55:53,520
(The marriage between the chairman's daughter and a mere employee)

648
00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:12,330
Yes?

649
00:56:12,330 --> 00:56:14,440
I don't know what to tell you.

650
00:56:15,340 --> 00:56:16,510
Is something wrong?

651
00:56:17,110 --> 00:56:20,240
I think the School Violence Committee will be set up.

652
00:56:21,510 --> 00:56:22,640
Why, all of a sudden?

653
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:26,180
Jun Seo's mother came to see us.

654
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:33,160
She told us not to give you...

655
00:56:33,420 --> 00:56:34,890
her number.

656
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:38,630
I don't think she wants to agree on a settlement.

657
00:56:38,630 --> 00:56:39,630
I see.

658
00:56:41,030 --> 00:56:42,130
What about...

659
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:44,770
his father's number?

660
00:56:45,030 --> 00:56:46,840
- He said he would give... - I'm sorry.

661
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:50,010
We can't give you that, either.

662
00:56:50,410 --> 00:56:52,340
- I'm really sorry. - Then...

663
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:55,710
when will it be held?

664
00:57:03,350 --> 00:57:06,460
This will be a great opportunity for Seoul Bank as well.

665
00:57:06,820 --> 00:57:09,360
All right. Let's get it started.

666
00:57:09,620 --> 00:57:10,630
Thank you, sir.

667
00:57:14,730 --> 00:57:16,500
Go ahead. Take it.

668
00:57:17,070 --> 00:57:18,100
Excuse me.

669
00:57:21,870 --> 00:57:23,370
Yes? What is it?

670
00:57:23,770 --> 00:57:25,940
Dad, are you with Mom?

671
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:27,510
No, why?

672
00:57:27,910 --> 00:57:30,850
I wanted to ask Mom what she said.

673
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:34,150
What do you mean?

674
00:57:34,450 --> 00:57:36,650
They're going to hold the School Violence Committee...

675
00:57:36,650 --> 00:57:37,990
because of Mom.

676
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:43,390
Yes. The head of Seoul Bank?

677
00:57:45,860 --> 00:57:46,860
All right.

678
00:57:48,630 --> 00:57:50,570
What is he up to?

679
00:57:56,100 --> 00:57:58,940
Excuse me. May I see Ms. Jang?

680
00:57:58,940 --> 00:58:00,140
Do you have an appointment?

681
00:58:00,980 --> 00:58:02,640
- Not really... - Then no, ma'am.

682
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:04,050
You need to make an appointment.

683
00:58:04,650 --> 00:58:06,480
Is she in, though?

684
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:07,820
I can't tell you, ma'am.

685
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:10,490
Then...

686
00:58:11,250 --> 00:58:13,660
- What about Mr. Han? - It will be the same, ma'am.

687
00:58:13,860 --> 00:58:15,860
You cannot see them unless you have an appointment.

688
00:58:17,190 --> 00:58:18,260
Hey!

689
00:58:19,490 --> 00:58:20,500
What is it?

690
00:58:21,130 --> 00:58:22,330
What's wrong?

691
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:24,300
You can't do this here.

692
00:58:24,930 --> 00:58:27,100
No, I'm not here because of the protest.

693
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:28,770
Please let me call them, at least.

694
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,740
You can't do this here. Please step outside.

695
00:58:30,740 --> 00:58:32,640
- No, I... - Please leave.

696
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:34,310
- I... - Come, ma'am.

697
00:58:34,610 --> 00:58:35,710
What do you think you're doing?

698
00:58:36,650 --> 00:58:39,450
I told you not to change the decision.

699
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:41,050
Why shouldn't I?

700
00:58:41,250 --> 00:58:43,650
It wasn't serious enough to ruin someone's life.

701
00:58:43,650 --> 00:58:45,220
You fire employees...

702
00:58:45,350 --> 00:58:46,760
and sue them for interfering...

703
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:48,720
with your business so easily.

704
00:58:49,060 --> 00:58:50,830
Why are you worried about his life?

705
00:58:51,090 --> 00:58:52,190
He's a young boy.

706
00:58:53,060 --> 00:58:54,200
He's just 14.

707
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:56,900
I'm sure you fired a truckload of people...

708
00:58:57,430 --> 00:58:59,270
who have kids that are younger.

709
00:59:00,740 --> 00:59:02,270
I'm saying we should play it by the rules.

710
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:04,070
I'm not trying to teach the kid...

711
00:59:04,070 --> 00:59:05,870
who hit my baby a lesson.

712
00:59:07,580 --> 00:59:10,080
Well, I guess I can't say it's 100 percent not that.

713
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:21,190
So, Young Min.

714
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:24,660
Please tell me why you did it.

715
00:59:25,290 --> 00:59:28,160
I don't care if they hold the committee.

716
00:59:29,060 --> 00:59:30,570
Of course, you do.

717
00:59:31,430 --> 00:59:32,770
You said you liked school.

718
00:59:32,930 --> 00:59:34,840
You liked your teachers and said the class was fun.

719
00:59:36,100 --> 00:59:37,140
Young Min.

720
00:59:37,570 --> 00:59:40,340
I really don't believe you did anything wrong.

721
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:44,250
I was just annoyed. At everything.

722
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:46,080
"Just"?

723
00:59:47,380 --> 00:59:49,220
You did it without a reason?

724
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:51,290
I'm almost in the eighth grade.

725
00:59:52,650 --> 00:59:53,960
I will be, soon.

726
00:59:55,460 --> 00:59:58,230
They say kids get moody then.

727
00:59:58,560 --> 01:00:01,100
Says who? That doesn't even make any sense!

728
01:00:01,100 --> 01:00:04,570
Isn't Dad coming tomorrow? What do I do?

729
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:40,970
(Mom)

730
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:50,550
(Mom...)

731
01:01:08,300 --> 01:01:09,300
(Building 2)

732
01:01:25,750 --> 01:01:26,980
Where's Seo Kyung?

733
01:01:27,720 --> 01:01:30,150
She just left for the school, sir.

734
01:02:04,420 --> 01:02:05,750
Don't worry, ma'am.

735
01:02:06,190 --> 01:02:09,060
We'll be careful not to let any rumors out.

736
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:11,760
Of course, you should.

737
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:14,760
It's just as embarrassing to be known as the victim.

738
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:20,670
Ms. Yoon.

739
01:02:42,420 --> 01:02:43,560
I beg of you, ma'am.

740
01:02:44,330 --> 01:02:45,830
Please reconsider it.

741
01:02:46,660 --> 01:02:48,500
- The boy's future... - I'm doing this...

742
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:50,170
for the boy's future, ma'am.

743
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:52,700
Isn't it the adults' duty...

744
01:02:52,700 --> 01:02:55,100
to tell them what's right and wrong?

745
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,370
It can't be good for his education...

746
01:02:58,370 --> 01:03:00,040
if we let it slide without punishment...

747
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:02,310
when he committed a crime, don't you think?

748
01:03:03,210 --> 01:03:05,250
And for the other students, as well.

749
01:03:07,050 --> 01:03:08,080
If...

750
01:03:10,250 --> 01:03:12,390
the reason you're trying to hold...

751
01:03:13,250 --> 01:03:15,920
the committee is because it's your son...

752
01:03:15,990 --> 01:03:17,090
What did you say?

753
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:20,900
Please take it out on me.

754
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,800
It's my fault...

755
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:25,800
for raising him poorly.

756
01:03:26,170 --> 01:03:27,940
You can take it out on me...

757
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:29,970
however you like.

758
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:38,180
However I like?

759
01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:42,650
Yes, ma'am. However.

760
01:03:46,690 --> 01:03:50,390
Then let's see what you can do...

761
01:03:50,860 --> 01:03:52,690
to relieve my anger.

762
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:32,830
Please, ma'am.

763
01:04:33,940 --> 01:04:35,270
Forgive him...

764
01:04:36,340 --> 01:04:37,770
just this once.

765
01:04:53,020 --> 01:04:54,260
Please get up.

766
01:04:55,090 --> 01:04:57,690
What do you think you're doing?

767
01:04:57,960 --> 01:04:59,960
Get up, Yoon Ji Su!

768
01:05:45,470 --> 01:05:47,440
(When My Love Blooms)

769
01:05:48,980 --> 01:05:50,780
I can't help but think of the old days.

770
01:05:52,610 --> 01:05:53,650
Ji Su!

771
01:05:55,250 --> 01:05:56,880
It's been so long.

772
01:06:02,260 --> 01:06:03,760
Good luck, Ji Su.

773
01:06:04,630 --> 01:06:07,830
Just keep in mind that I'll be watching her.

774
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:09,660
Are you asking me to leave them?

775
01:06:09,660 --> 01:06:11,830
I don't want you to suffer.

776
01:06:12,700 --> 01:06:13,770
No.

777
01:06:15,940 --> 01:06:17,110
I want to protect you.
