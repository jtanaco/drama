1
00:00:16,184 --> 00:00:17,224
There you are.

2
00:00:21,594 --> 00:00:22,625
Yoon Ji Su.

3
00:00:27,665 --> 00:00:28,735
There you are.

4
00:00:30,404 --> 00:00:31,474
Yoon Ji Su.

5
00:00:55,095 --> 00:00:57,565
I should have found you sooner.

6
00:01:00,235 --> 00:01:01,364
I'm so late.

7
00:01:04,035 --> 00:01:05,834
You didn't find me.

8
00:01:07,274 --> 00:01:08,804
We ended it.

9
00:01:10,545 --> 00:01:12,414
How could I not look for you?

10
00:01:16,414 --> 00:01:18,884
Why did you go into hiding?

11
00:01:19,724 --> 00:01:21,254
I kind of understand,

12
00:01:22,054 --> 00:01:23,724
and I also resented it.

13
00:01:26,395 --> 00:01:27,925
Before I could do anything,

14
00:01:29,664 --> 00:01:31,765
we parted helplessly.

15
00:01:34,604 --> 00:01:37,575
It was as if I had a fishbone lodged in my throat.

16
00:01:40,905 --> 00:01:41,974
I'm sorry but...

17
00:01:44,045 --> 00:01:46,175
I don't remember the past much.

18
00:01:47,084 --> 00:01:48,214
To be honest,

19
00:01:50,015 --> 00:01:51,754
I don't have many memories of you.

20
00:01:54,485 --> 00:01:55,955
Thank you for dropping it.

21
00:01:57,024 --> 00:01:59,964
And I'm sorry your son was hurt.

22
00:02:01,094 --> 00:02:02,494
His name is Young Min?

23
00:02:05,665 --> 00:02:07,635
He seemed sweet and cute.

24
00:02:08,834 --> 00:02:11,735
I don't yet know why the two fought.

25
00:02:12,475 --> 00:02:15,374
There's nothing to be sorry about...

26
00:02:18,015 --> 00:02:19,374
or grateful.

27
00:02:19,714 --> 00:02:20,814
Anyway,

28
00:02:22,344 --> 00:02:24,985
thank you. I should go.

(Hwabon Station)

32
00:03:07,524 --> 00:03:09,934
Even a senior you don't have many memories of...

33
00:03:10,864 --> 00:03:12,534
will be a useful guide.

34
00:03:14,034 --> 00:03:15,934
I helped at many rural communities.

35
00:03:15,934 --> 00:03:17,735
I know my way around countrysides like this.

36
00:03:54,344 --> 00:03:55,744
- Who's there? - My gosh!

37
00:04:09,755 --> 00:04:11,424
I won't ask you to hold my hand.

38
00:04:11,424 --> 00:04:12,724
Just stay close.

39
00:04:14,594 --> 00:04:15,924
It's okay.

40
00:04:18,495 --> 00:04:19,594
Okay then.

41
00:04:20,305 --> 00:04:22,904
Don't lose me. Follow my footsteps.

42
00:04:38,214 --> 00:04:39,584
Don't lose me.

43
00:04:41,354 --> 00:04:42,685
Don't look anywhere else.

44
00:04:44,024 --> 00:04:45,255
Follow my footsteps.

C sharp minor. 9. 9, 9.

B7 and 13. Teen, teen.

47
00:06:23,724 --> 00:06:25,195
Teen.

48
00:06:25,755 --> 00:06:28,524
What, is this math or music?

49
00:06:33,705 --> 00:06:37,834

I'd love to give that a try

The only person I can page is Lee Dong Jin

62
00:07:55,784 --> 00:07:59,214
- I'm ruined - Why are you still here?

63
00:08:01,455 --> 00:08:02,755
My gosh.

64
00:08:02,755 --> 00:08:04,654
Why are your eyes closed?

65
00:08:04,895 --> 00:08:07,224
You're such a joke, you are.

(GMAT Special Lecture by Kim Gi Hwan)

67
00:08:10,294 --> 00:08:11,664
I think that's mine.

68
00:08:27,345 --> 00:08:28,515
There you are.

69
00:08:29,985 --> 00:08:31,085
Yoon Ji Su.

70
00:08:41,194 --> 00:08:44,064
You know my name?

71
00:08:45,564 --> 00:08:47,835
It was in huge letters on your sheet music.

72
00:08:48,404 --> 00:08:51,404
Oh. You remembered.

73
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:55,544
That handkerchief was expensive.

74
00:08:58,645 --> 00:09:00,814
It doesn't look too expensive.

75
00:09:00,985 --> 00:09:02,784
My mother's gift when I started university.

76
00:09:03,755 --> 00:09:05,154
Oh, I'm sorry.

77
00:09:05,385 --> 00:09:07,554
I meant to return it.

78
00:09:07,924 --> 00:09:09,225
No, you keep it.

79
00:09:09,654 --> 00:09:10,755
Why?

80
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:13,965
Your snot and hair grease. It's dirty.

81
00:09:13,965 --> 00:09:16,865
I didn't tie my hair with it. You called before I could.

82
00:09:17,534 --> 00:09:20,505
And I can't keep your mother's gift.

83
00:09:20,505 --> 00:09:22,265
I have five more. It was a set.

84
00:09:23,235 --> 00:09:26,274
So stop hanging around my society...

85
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:27,475
and study.

86
00:09:28,245 --> 00:09:29,875
No one studies.

87
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:31,845
- What? - The seniors protest...

88
00:09:31,845 --> 00:09:33,645
and freshmen get drunk.

89
00:09:33,814 --> 00:09:35,245
No one studies.

90
00:09:37,215 --> 00:09:38,885
You learned all the bad things.

91
00:09:40,054 --> 00:09:41,654
We study really hard.

92
00:09:41,855 --> 00:09:43,284
We read and debate every day.

93
00:09:43,284 --> 00:09:45,855
If I study hard, will you date me?

94
00:09:56,465 --> 00:09:57,635
No... No.

95
00:10:00,105 --> 00:10:01,444
Your cassette tape.

96
00:10:04,574 --> 00:10:07,044
You dropped it on the grass.

97
00:10:08,444 --> 00:10:10,044
I didn't listen to it.

98
00:10:10,255 --> 00:10:11,355
Hand it over.

99
00:10:14,054 --> 00:10:17,225
If the chord's too hard, can't you just change the note?

100
00:10:22,924 --> 00:10:24,034
Forget it.

101
00:10:24,235 --> 00:10:25,635
I memorized it.

102
00:10:27,465 --> 00:10:28,704
Still, forget it.

103
00:10:28,804 --> 00:10:30,135
I don't want to.

104
00:10:30,774 --> 00:10:32,235
The song's nice,

105
00:10:32,404 --> 00:10:34,574
and you're even nicer.

106
00:10:35,544 --> 00:10:37,774
I realize that you're just another person,

107
00:10:38,044 --> 00:10:39,975
and unlike when you protest,

108
00:10:40,385 --> 00:10:41,885
you're quite cute.

109
00:10:41,885 --> 00:10:42,985
You...

110
00:10:44,215 --> 00:10:45,985
Don't show that you know me.

111
00:11:03,674 --> 00:11:05,235
As if she doesn't remember.

112
00:11:05,835 --> 00:11:08,774
She kept my handkerchief for over 20 years.

113
00:11:19,015 --> 00:11:20,684
As if I don't remember.

114
00:11:23,154 --> 00:11:25,225
I even remember the song.

115
00:11:31,265 --> 00:11:33,564
Love

116
00:11:34,304 --> 00:11:35,965
And dating

117
00:11:36,835 --> 00:11:39,475
I'd love to give that a try

118
00:11:41,605 --> 00:11:43,745
The only person

119
00:11:44,475 --> 00:11:46,274
I can page

120
00:11:46,615 --> 00:11:50,684
is Lee Dong Jin

(Bed and Breakfast)

122
00:12:54,284 --> 00:12:56,044
She still sweeps with her foot.

123
00:13:18,534 --> 00:13:20,904
Young lady, take this.

124
00:13:21,044 --> 00:13:22,674
It's your breakfast.

125
00:13:22,674 --> 00:13:24,814
I put some rice water on the boil.

126
00:13:25,115 --> 00:13:26,274
Take this.

127
00:13:38,454 --> 00:13:41,725
The rice water tastes really nice today.

128
00:13:49,304 --> 00:13:51,005
Are you two just dating?

129
00:13:52,235 --> 00:13:55,174
If you're married, you wouldn't take separate rooms.

130
00:13:55,674 --> 00:13:57,375
Even more so if this is an affair.

131
00:14:00,314 --> 00:14:02,645
It's neither. We're just friends.

132
00:14:02,645 --> 00:14:04,054
What a joke.

133
00:14:04,054 --> 00:14:06,115
Men and women can't be friends.

134
00:14:06,115 --> 00:14:08,524
Why not? Friendship can cross genders.

135
00:14:09,855 --> 00:14:11,895
How do you know so much?

136
00:14:11,895 --> 00:14:12,995
Those special terms.

137
00:14:12,995 --> 00:14:16,664
I watch a drama every day before I watch the 9pm news.

138
00:14:16,794 --> 00:14:18,235
That's all they talk about.

139
00:14:18,235 --> 00:14:20,605
People slap each other over affairs,

140
00:14:20,605 --> 00:14:23,835
and sometimes they even fling kimchi.

141
00:14:24,404 --> 00:14:27,005
Gosh, it's such a sight.

142
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:43,725
I hope it snows some more.

143
00:14:45,255 --> 00:14:46,495
So we get stuck here.

144
00:14:59,074 --> 00:15:01,304
Can I take a look?

145
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:07,444
Let me see.

146
00:15:25,135 --> 00:15:26,194
Hold this.

147
00:15:41,845 --> 00:15:42,914
It won't come out.

148
00:15:46,554 --> 00:15:48,924
- It's fine now. - I'm almost done.

149
00:15:55,924 --> 00:15:56,965
It came out.

150
00:16:21,684 --> 00:16:23,725
Isn't your family worried?

151
00:16:24,855 --> 00:16:27,564
They said it's fine. To take my time.

152
00:16:29,024 --> 00:16:30,064
Good.

153
00:16:32,034 --> 00:16:34,765
From what I saw of your kid, his dad must be a nice man.

154
00:16:35,335 --> 00:16:37,064
Can I ask what he does?

155
00:16:38,475 --> 00:16:39,605
He's a lawyer.

156
00:16:41,145 --> 00:16:42,204
Is he?

157
00:16:43,145 --> 00:16:45,044
Then he must've studied law like me.

158
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:46,774
Was he from our university?

159
00:16:53,885 --> 00:16:54,885
Jae Hyun.

160
00:16:59,424 --> 00:17:01,125
These conversations make me uncomfortable.

161
00:17:03,395 --> 00:17:05,234
Thank you for yesterday and today,

162
00:17:05,865 --> 00:17:07,764
and if I owe you, I'll pay you.

163
00:17:08,335 --> 00:17:09,504
That's all.

164
00:17:10,734 --> 00:17:13,504
I want to deal with it as parents of two classmates.

165
00:17:16,404 --> 00:17:18,115
I feel uncomfortable listening to...

166
00:17:18,115 --> 00:17:19,414
old stories I barely remember.

167
00:17:20,845 --> 00:17:23,484
Okay. I understand.

168
00:17:25,315 --> 00:17:28,555
The sun's up now, so let's each go our own way.

169
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:18,486
Welcome back, sir.

170
00:18:19,715 --> 00:18:20,915
I'll take you home,

171
00:18:20,915 --> 00:18:22,915
then go back for your car.

172
00:18:52,746 --> 00:18:54,955
- Hey, Jae Hyun. - Hey.

173
00:18:56,256 --> 00:18:57,855
How much do lawyers make?

174
00:18:58,256 --> 00:19:00,586
- Do you want to become one? - No.

175
00:19:01,455 --> 00:19:04,326
Is it tough to make a living?

176
00:19:04,865 --> 00:19:07,096
It depends on the lawyer.

177
00:19:07,996 --> 00:19:11,006
A civil-rights lawyer or a public defender...

178
00:19:11,836 --> 00:19:13,665
could struggle financially, right?

179
00:19:13,665 --> 00:19:16,576
Hey, are you getting fired? Does the old man want you gone?

180
00:19:17,236 --> 00:19:19,746
I gave you some detailed advice...

181
00:19:19,746 --> 00:19:21,316
to put away some cash.

182
00:19:21,316 --> 00:19:23,576
You jerk. Thanks anyway.

183
00:19:48,675 --> 00:19:50,205
- Jun Woo. - Yes?

184
00:19:50,635 --> 00:19:52,576
The person who dropped this handkerchief.

185
00:19:53,076 --> 00:19:55,076
You had that.

186
00:19:55,246 --> 00:19:56,715
I was going to throw it away.

187
00:19:57,645 --> 00:19:59,945
What did it look like the woman did?

188
00:19:59,945 --> 00:20:01,016
I don't know.

189
00:20:01,016 --> 00:20:03,086
She had a bag full of 500ml water bottles.

190
00:20:03,715 --> 00:20:04,925
Does she sell them?

191
00:20:05,355 --> 00:20:07,355
Anyway, you know the typical middle-aged woman.

192
00:20:07,695 --> 00:20:09,526
Relentless and thick-faced.

193
00:20:09,925 --> 00:20:11,266
She was pretty though.

194
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:13,395
I bet she was popular back in the day.

195
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:16,135
- Find out about her. - Pardon?

196
00:20:18,266 --> 00:20:19,635
Come on, sir.

197
00:20:19,965 --> 00:20:21,776
Because she's pretty?

198
00:20:21,776 --> 00:20:23,875
You almost hit her in the street...

199
00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:25,145
and you want to ignore that?

200
00:20:25,645 --> 00:20:26,905
What human does that?

201
00:20:27,405 --> 00:20:29,615
- Is that how I taught you? - No, sir.

202
00:20:31,415 --> 00:20:33,016
I know nothing about her.

203
00:20:33,346 --> 00:20:35,415
- I do. - Pardon?

204
00:20:35,786 --> 00:20:37,256
Her child goes to Jun Seo's school.

205
00:20:37,256 --> 00:20:38,655
What? Really?

206
00:20:42,895 --> 00:20:46,496
(Convalescent Ward)

207
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:50,665
(Homeroom Teacher)

208
00:20:50,665 --> 00:20:52,405
I keep asking Young Min,

209
00:20:52,705 --> 00:20:55,105
but he won't say what happened.

210
00:21:05,445 --> 00:21:07,316
Young Min won't say.

211
00:21:09,486 --> 00:21:11,655
The meek and sweet little boy...

212
00:21:13,385 --> 00:21:15,655
threw a chair at a kid.

213
00:21:18,726 --> 00:21:21,195
And I completely forgot about that.

214
00:21:22,965 --> 00:21:24,736
From last night until now.

215
00:21:27,306 --> 00:21:29,076
I'm a bad mom, aren't I?

216
00:21:36,415 --> 00:21:37,846
It snowed.

217
00:21:40,615 --> 00:21:42,885
It snowed a lot. Maybe that's why.

218
00:21:46,155 --> 00:21:48,256
This season thing really gets to me.

219
00:21:52,326 --> 00:21:54,836
I wish there were only one season,

220
00:21:55,895 --> 00:21:57,365
but there are four.

221
00:21:59,306 --> 00:22:02,635
Each one of them is pretty and heart-fluttering.

222
00:22:05,076 --> 00:22:07,506
They come hand-in-hand with him.

223
00:22:09,776 --> 00:22:11,786
On some days, he comes with the wind.

224
00:22:13,286 --> 00:22:15,016
On some days, he comes with the flowers.

225
00:22:16,655 --> 00:22:18,286
On some days, he comes with the rain.

226
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:27,526
When I close my eyes not to see him, I can remember him more vividly.

227
00:22:29,036 --> 00:22:31,336
When I drink because I feel so miserable,

228
00:22:31,566 --> 00:22:33,536
he shows up in my dream without a warning.

229
00:22:35,875 --> 00:22:38,976
He shows up every single day even when I don't do anything,

230
00:22:39,346 --> 00:22:41,415
so I couldn't live my life.

231
00:22:48,655 --> 00:22:49,786
No.

232
00:22:52,125 --> 00:22:53,355
Actually,

233
00:22:57,695 --> 00:22:59,766
I could live because of his memories.

234
00:23:07,536 --> 00:23:10,905
I imagined us meeting again over hundreds of times.

235
00:23:14,006 --> 00:23:15,016
But what happened yesterday...

236
00:23:15,016 --> 00:23:17,375
wasn't in any of the scenarios I thought of.

237
00:23:20,915 --> 00:23:23,385
Why did we have to meet again...

238
00:23:24,586 --> 00:23:27,086
when I was the most pathetic and miserable?

239
00:23:56,915 --> 00:23:58,986
They are my wife...

240
00:23:59,586 --> 00:24:01,056
and my daughter.

241
00:24:02,296 --> 00:24:04,056
Aren't they beautiful?

242
00:24:17,175 --> 00:24:19,675
But it was nice seeing Jae Hyun again.

243
00:24:23,076 --> 00:24:24,375
That's why I can understand...

244
00:24:24,375 --> 00:24:26,346
how much pain you must be in, Dad.

245
00:24:50,105 --> 00:24:53,006
Sir, your wife is home.

246
00:25:04,986 --> 00:25:06,355
Can we talk?

247
00:25:13,695 --> 00:25:15,965
Do you run a charity?

248
00:25:16,096 --> 00:25:19,036
I thought you already donated enough of your money.

249
00:25:19,105 --> 00:25:20,266
What's your point?

250
00:25:20,266 --> 00:25:22,576
Who told you we would let this incident slide?

251
00:25:22,875 --> 00:25:24,806
Who said you could let that kid off the hook?

252
00:25:25,546 --> 00:25:27,705
Should I have put him in prison or something?

253
00:25:27,705 --> 00:25:30,375
Of course. He attacked our son.

254
00:25:30,375 --> 00:25:31,746
It's nothing serious.

255
00:25:32,046 --> 00:25:33,246
And he's still a kid.

256
00:25:34,246 --> 00:25:36,215
It's worse because he's only a kid.

257
00:25:36,286 --> 00:25:38,955
He's already violent toward other kids at that age.

258
00:25:38,955 --> 00:25:41,155
What if his aim was better and the chair hit our son?

259
00:25:41,655 --> 00:25:43,026
Didn't you think about that?

260
00:25:43,026 --> 00:25:44,796
Check on Jun Seo first.

261
00:25:45,526 --> 00:25:46,625
See if he made any mistakes.

262
00:25:46,625 --> 00:25:48,566
Even if he did, that doesn't matter!

263
00:25:48,695 --> 00:25:50,096
I'm already annoyed...

264
00:25:50,096 --> 00:25:52,605
that he's going to school with my son for free.

265
00:25:52,836 --> 00:25:54,836
We'll settle this? We won't press charges?

266
00:25:55,006 --> 00:25:56,935
That will never happen!

267
00:25:57,135 --> 00:26:00,006
If you do this, you'll only ruin our son.

268
00:26:01,046 --> 00:26:02,715
I heard a few things about the incident,

269
00:26:02,715 --> 00:26:03,746
so don't dismiss my decision.

270
00:26:24,766 --> 00:26:26,365
Can we talk?

271
00:26:31,246 --> 00:26:33,905
I don't like beating around the bush. I'll cut to the chase.

272
00:26:33,976 --> 00:26:36,476
I want you to resign your position as the chairperson of our committee.

273
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:39,615
It won't be pretty if we object.

274
00:26:39,615 --> 00:26:41,756
I want you to tell the school that you'll resign.

275
00:26:43,816 --> 00:26:45,655
I didn't take the position because I wanted to,

276
00:26:45,655 --> 00:26:47,425
so I can tell the school I'll resign,

277
00:26:47,925 --> 00:26:49,726
but may I ask you why?

278
00:26:49,826 --> 00:26:51,566
I heard about Young Min.

279
00:26:51,826 --> 00:26:54,165
Well, it's not just about him.

280
00:26:55,266 --> 00:26:57,435
The problem is you.

281
00:26:58,865 --> 00:27:01,066
You lied to us more than I can count.

282
00:27:02,006 --> 00:27:03,306
You're divorced.

283
00:27:03,306 --> 00:27:06,076
I guess you don't need to disclose that since it's your personal life.

284
00:27:06,976 --> 00:27:08,675
But you're working at a supermarket.

285
00:27:08,675 --> 00:27:10,375
That's a bit appalling, you know.

286
00:27:11,145 --> 00:27:14,215
Another parent saw you doing a protest in front...

287
00:27:14,215 --> 00:27:15,986
of the supermarket headquarters.

288
00:27:16,256 --> 00:27:17,316
Was she wrong?

289
00:27:17,316 --> 00:27:19,625
Must I disclose my personal life...

290
00:27:20,155 --> 00:27:21,925
to you?

291
00:27:21,925 --> 00:27:24,425
You shouldn't have deceived us at least.

292
00:27:24,826 --> 00:27:28,236
I'm sorry if you felt I deceived you.

293
00:27:29,135 --> 00:27:31,705
I didn't want to tell you because I didn't want you...

294
00:27:31,705 --> 00:27:33,736
to judge my son based on my decision.

295
00:27:33,766 --> 00:27:36,806
Let's be honest. Weren't you embarrassed to tell us?

296
00:27:37,405 --> 00:27:39,776
You already knew that you wouldn't...

297
00:27:39,776 --> 00:27:41,276
be able to socialize with us.

298
00:27:44,415 --> 00:27:46,486
That part is true.

299
00:27:46,615 --> 00:27:49,516
Dealing with school stuff and eating brunch at the hotel was too much.

300
00:27:50,086 --> 00:27:52,326
This all worked out. I'll tell the school.

301
00:27:52,425 --> 00:27:55,026
Unbelievable. How could you be so brazen?

302
00:27:55,026 --> 00:27:56,026
Aren't you going to apologize?

303
00:27:56,026 --> 00:27:57,625
You must have forgotten already.

304
00:27:57,625 --> 00:27:59,296
I already did 30 seconds again.

305
00:28:13,105 --> 00:28:15,175
(Lee Se Hun)

306
00:28:22,615 --> 00:28:23,885
What is it?

307
00:28:27,056 --> 00:28:28,925
Tell me what you couldn't tell me on the phone.

308
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:32,865
This is rude. You didn't even knock.

309
00:28:33,226 --> 00:28:35,435
I keep my manners only to humans.

310
00:28:38,536 --> 00:28:41,165
Did something happen to Young Min?

311
00:28:42,006 --> 00:28:43,076
No.

312
00:28:44,405 --> 00:28:45,445
Really?

313
00:28:45,976 --> 00:28:48,175
- Nothing happened. - That's odd.

314
00:28:48,645 --> 00:28:50,875
Why is his cell phone turned off then?

315
00:28:50,875 --> 00:28:52,145
It's been off for two days.

316
00:28:54,486 --> 00:28:56,115
Didn't you call him?

317
00:28:57,816 --> 00:28:59,425
He called me with his friend's phone.

318
00:28:59,425 --> 00:29:01,155
He said his phone was broken.

319
00:29:01,695 --> 00:29:03,726
I see. Is that so?

320
00:29:05,695 --> 00:29:08,296
If this is it, you should tell me on the phone.

321
00:29:09,496 --> 00:29:11,435
I can't see your eyes on the phone.

322
00:29:13,205 --> 00:29:15,736
Our eyes can't lie.

323
00:29:20,746 --> 00:29:22,816
I will never come to your office again.

324
00:29:23,175 --> 00:29:25,445
You should try to find a way to tell if I'm lying or not...

325
00:29:25,746 --> 00:29:27,046
through my voice.

326
00:29:42,665 --> 00:29:45,306
If you settle, your charge can get acquitted.

327
00:29:47,465 --> 00:29:49,135
I won't settle.

328
00:29:51,336 --> 00:29:54,205
If the court accepts you did this on purpose, you'll serve time...

329
00:29:54,675 --> 00:29:56,375
when you shouldn't serve time.

330
00:29:56,816 --> 00:29:59,986
It was neither an accident nor done in the heat of the moment.

331
00:30:01,046 --> 00:30:02,586
He mocked the accident...

332
00:30:02,586 --> 00:30:04,516
and ridiculed my bereaved family.

333
00:30:04,786 --> 00:30:07,026
He didn't show any signs of remorse or repentance.

334
00:30:08,996 --> 00:30:10,125
I...

335
00:30:10,955 --> 00:30:12,996
intended to do it.

336
00:30:16,135 --> 00:30:18,205
I'm going to tell the world...

337
00:30:18,806 --> 00:30:20,365

- Wake up! - Wake up!

00:31:10,756 --> 00:31:11,855
Hey.

348
00:31:14,826 --> 00:31:16,556
It's about the woman you wanted me to look into.

349
00:31:16,556 --> 00:31:18,726
Yes. What did you find out about her?

350
00:31:19,195 --> 00:31:20,826
She's divorced.

351
00:31:20,826 --> 00:31:21,996
She's divorced?

352
00:31:21,996 --> 00:31:23,395
Yes, three years ago.

353
00:31:24,096 --> 00:31:26,036
That can't be right.

354
00:31:26,036 --> 00:31:28,375
As of now, it's just her and her son on her family register.

355
00:31:28,375 --> 00:31:30,605
Does it mean she's raising her son alone?

356
00:31:30,605 --> 00:31:32,276
Yes, it seems like it.

357
00:31:32,405 --> 00:31:35,316
Then, what about her ex-husband?

358
00:31:36,046 --> 00:31:37,675
Is he paying her alimony?

359
00:31:37,675 --> 00:31:39,546
He's a lawyer at a law firm.

360
00:31:39,546 --> 00:31:41,115
They had a divorce lawsuit.

361
00:31:41,115 --> 00:31:42,915
In exchange for getting the custody of their son,

362
00:31:42,915 --> 00:31:45,286
she gave up on receiving alimony and child support.

363
00:31:45,486 --> 00:31:46,625
How does she get by?

364
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:48,296
Does she have a job?

365
00:31:48,296 --> 00:31:50,326
No, not really.

366
00:31:50,726 --> 00:31:52,695
It looks like she has a few part-time jobs.

367
00:31:56,536 --> 00:31:59,165
(Make sure to turn on your headlights.)

368
00:32:32,135 --> 00:32:33,205
Yes, hello.

369
00:32:33,935 --> 00:32:35,806
Ms. Yoon. You called me earlier.

370
00:32:36,076 --> 00:32:39,346
Yes. Young Min's cell phone is turned off.

371
00:32:39,705 --> 00:32:41,205
I was worried if something happened to him.

372
00:32:42,046 --> 00:32:44,175
No, nothing happened. He was in all of his classes.

373
00:32:44,615 --> 00:32:45,615
Really?

374
00:32:46,945 --> 00:32:48,955
I'll tell Young Min to call you.

375
00:32:50,016 --> 00:32:52,385
Okay. Please tell him to call him.

376
00:32:53,226 --> 00:32:54,256
And...

377
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:57,195
there's one more favor I wanted to ask you.

378
00:32:57,395 --> 00:32:58,625
Sure, go ahead.

379
00:33:00,026 --> 00:33:03,065
If his father calls,

380
00:33:04,365 --> 00:33:06,505
could you not tell him about the incident?

381
00:33:10,175 --> 00:33:11,476
I don't want him to worry.

382
00:33:13,146 --> 00:33:14,976
Okay. Thank you.

383
00:33:37,235 --> 00:33:38,965
What is it? Did I annoy you?

384
00:33:41,106 --> 00:33:44,536
I must have lost my mind when I hurt my head.

385
00:33:45,576 --> 00:33:48,146
It's because of you, so I hope you understand.

And you must quickly decide what you plan to do...

393
00:34:39,425 --> 00:34:41,666
with the temporary employees who have been protesting...

394
00:34:41,865 --> 00:34:43,436
for over a month now.

395
00:34:43,596 --> 00:34:46,306
What do you think I should do, Mr. Park?

396
00:34:46,306 --> 00:34:49,206
We didn't violate the contract.

397
00:34:49,576 --> 00:34:53,175
But they are arguing that the contract itself was unfair.

398
00:34:53,606 --> 00:34:55,615
- I want us to stick to the law. - Put yourself in their shoes.

399
00:34:57,215 --> 00:35:00,115
Most of them are housewives in their 40s and 50s.

400
00:35:01,246 --> 00:35:03,686
If we just terminate them at this day and age, they will...

401
00:35:03,686 --> 00:35:06,025
start petitioning and cause quite a mess.

402
00:35:06,226 --> 00:35:08,226
Then, what do you suggest that we do?

403
00:35:08,226 --> 00:35:10,056
Just let them be.

404
00:35:10,596 --> 00:35:13,925
It looked like they were having fun. It's like they're on a picnic.

405
00:35:14,065 --> 00:35:17,135
Do you think they'll break down the door and barge in here?

406
00:35:17,835 --> 00:35:18,865
Right.

407
00:35:19,206 --> 00:35:20,505
Talk to the legal team...

408
00:35:20,505 --> 00:35:22,376
and bring me a plan.

409
00:35:22,576 --> 00:35:25,606
Don't ask me questions like you're giving me a quiz.

410
00:35:26,706 --> 00:35:27,706
Okay.

411
00:35:27,905 --> 00:35:29,715
We'll pretend to negotiate the terms and stall time.

412
00:35:30,115 --> 00:35:31,576
And they'll be forced to disband.

413
00:35:32,445 --> 00:35:34,715
Illegal labor disputes, occupying our building without permission,

414
00:35:34,715 --> 00:35:36,115
obstruction of business, and so on.

415
00:35:36,815 --> 00:35:40,155
Gather all the evidence that could forcefully remove them.

416
00:35:41,186 --> 00:35:42,226
Yes, sir.

417
00:36:02,246 --> 00:36:04,715
By the way, why aren't you getting married?

418
00:36:05,646 --> 00:36:07,885
Wait, did you already get married once?

419
00:36:08,956 --> 00:36:12,356
I can't believe no one made a move on such a handsome man like you.

420
00:36:12,626 --> 00:36:14,755
- No way. - I'm sure he had a girlfriend.

421
00:36:15,755 --> 00:36:17,755
You couldn't choose because you had too many, right?

422
00:36:18,826 --> 00:36:20,065
I liked a girl,

423
00:36:21,195 --> 00:36:22,965
but she didn't know for 25 years...

424
00:36:23,365 --> 00:36:25,505
because she's like a horse at the racecourse.

425
00:36:28,606 --> 00:36:30,806
Well, it's not that bad.

426
00:36:31,536 --> 00:36:32,606
She won't...

427
00:36:33,846 --> 00:36:35,275
at least tell me she wants to break up.

428
00:36:38,846 --> 00:36:39,885
Hey.

429
00:36:47,255 --> 00:36:48,255
Let's go.

430
00:36:51,925 --> 00:36:53,096
You should sit here.

431
00:36:53,666 --> 00:36:55,365
- Pardon? - We finished our drinks.

432
00:36:56,536 --> 00:36:58,036
- But you didn't. - Have a good day.

433
00:36:58,865 --> 00:37:00,036
- Let's go. - Good luck.

434
00:37:00,036 --> 00:37:01,036
Good luck.

435
00:37:07,976 --> 00:37:09,175
What do they mean by that?

436
00:37:09,876 --> 00:37:11,646
They want me to have a busy night.

437
00:37:13,916 --> 00:37:16,056
Is it obvious that I drink a lot?

438
00:37:16,056 --> 00:37:17,155
A bit.

439
00:37:17,985 --> 00:37:20,126
I think I smell alcohol from you too.

440
00:37:20,126 --> 00:37:21,155

Yes, I need to give something to him.

Give me that. I'll give it to him.

What kind of club is it?

452
00:38:04,195 --> 00:38:06,436
Solidarity of Philosophy. It's a philosophy club.

453
00:38:07,005 --> 00:38:08,266
What a name.

454
00:38:08,266 --> 00:38:09,675
The name is a bit pretentious,

455
00:38:09,675 --> 00:38:11,436
but we just study philosophy there.

456
00:38:11,436 --> 00:38:12,806
I don't know much about philosophy.

457
00:38:12,806 --> 00:38:14,505
We don't know much either.

458

That's why we meet up and study.

so he attends the seminar every week.

463

Then, what kind of book does he buy?

00:41:50,035 --> 00:41:52,194
At times when the waiting grows longer

502
00:41:53,535 --> 00:41:55,405
I can not help but resent you

503
00:41:58,075 --> 00:42:01,175
Cirrus clouds float through the dark skies

504
00:42:02,814 --> 00:42:04,245
What song shall I have to sing

505
00:42:04,245 --> 00:42:06,584
In order for it to reach your ears?

506
00:42:07,685 --> 00:42:10,655
We never met, so we shall never part

507
00:42:11,385 --> 00:42:14,124
Yet we can not hold hands, though we never parted

508
00:42:15,794 --> 00:42:17,825
So as the waiting grows longer

509
00:42:18,555 --> 00:42:20,694
I can not help but resent you more

510
00:42:20,694 --> 00:42:22,635
(I can not help but resent you more)

511
00:43:30,694 --> 00:43:31,995
Is something wrong?

512
00:43:34,234 --> 00:43:35,564
What is it?

513
00:43:38,604 --> 00:43:40,475
I'm trying to decide...

514
00:43:42,814 --> 00:43:44,575
what to tell you first.

515
00:43:49,515 --> 00:43:50,854
I've decided.

516
00:43:51,254 --> 00:43:52,354
Hurry up.

517
00:43:55,794 --> 00:43:57,725
Young Min will be back in two days,

518
00:43:58,095 --> 00:43:59,894
and I still haven't gone grocery shopping.

519
00:44:01,095 --> 00:44:02,435
Come on, you...

520
00:44:03,135 --> 00:44:05,135
I should go before they close.

521
00:44:24,115 --> 00:44:26,584
She hasn't changed a bit.

522
00:44:27,354 --> 00:44:30,325
Why isn't she wearing any gloves?

523
00:44:31,725 --> 00:44:33,664
And her jacket is too thin.

524
00:44:33,664 --> 00:44:36,894
(3 Ice creams for 1 dollar, Soda for 1.5 dollars)

525
00:44:40,305 --> 00:44:41,464
Goodness.

526
00:44:42,774 --> 00:44:44,035
Who is this for?

527
00:44:44,504 --> 00:44:45,635
It's for me.

528
00:44:46,144 --> 00:44:47,905
Gosh, why?

529
00:44:47,905 --> 00:44:50,714
Why would a lady need to drink that much?

530
00:44:52,015 --> 00:44:53,285
Then what am I supposed to do?

531
00:44:53,285 --> 00:44:54,345
Do what?

532
00:44:54,345 --> 00:44:56,314
I already have a hard time falling asleep,

533
00:44:57,185 --> 00:44:59,055
and now it's going to get worse.

534
00:44:59,455 --> 00:45:00,524
Why?

535
00:45:00,984 --> 00:45:03,024
I shouldn't be acting like this.

536
00:45:03,694 --> 00:45:06,524
I need to get a grip, but it keeps coming back to me.

537
00:45:08,464 --> 00:45:10,635
It's driving me crazy!

538
00:45:46,564 --> 00:45:47,905
Where are you?

539
00:45:48,035 --> 00:45:50,035
Did you fall in a well or something?

540
00:45:50,035 --> 00:45:52,745
Why aren't you back? Why?

541
00:45:52,944 --> 00:45:55,205
Hurry up, already!

542
00:46:03,285 --> 00:46:04,455
Thank you.

543
00:46:07,754 --> 00:46:09,624
Here. Oh, gosh.

544
00:46:13,765 --> 00:46:15,524
I'll help you take this to the door.

545
00:46:15,524 --> 00:46:16,734
No, it's all right.

546
00:46:16,734 --> 00:46:17,995
This is heavy.

547
00:46:20,564 --> 00:46:22,575
Oh, thank you.

548
00:46:22,805 --> 00:46:24,274
No problem.

549
00:46:24,274 --> 00:46:27,444
Have we met before?

550
00:46:27,444 --> 00:46:29,975
I have a common-looking face, so I'm used to that.

551
00:46:29,975 --> 00:46:31,675
You don't look so common.

552
00:46:32,144 --> 00:46:34,414
Oh, really?

553
00:46:35,544 --> 00:46:38,354
I wonder why everyone says so. That's odd.

554
00:46:41,955 --> 00:46:43,694
Goodbye, then.

555
00:46:59,075 --> 00:47:00,774
- Good job. - No problem, sir.

556
00:47:01,944 --> 00:47:03,714
She went inside. Should we go?

557
00:47:05,274 --> 00:47:06,814
- Yes, let's go. - All right.

558
00:47:07,685 --> 00:47:11,214
May I ask how you know her?

559
00:47:11,214 --> 00:47:12,655
No, you may not.

560
00:47:12,885 --> 00:47:13,955
Yes, sir.

561
00:47:14,785 --> 00:47:16,725
- Hey, Jun Woo. - Yes, sir?

562
00:47:16,725 --> 00:47:18,725
Could you come straight here in the morning...

563
00:47:18,725 --> 00:47:20,095
for a few days?

564
00:47:20,894 --> 00:47:22,595
- Sorry? - See where she's headed...

565
00:47:22,595 --> 00:47:24,095
and what she's doing.

566
00:47:25,694 --> 00:47:26,805
Yes, sir.

567
00:47:27,834 --> 00:47:29,805
It's not stalking, and it's not a crime.

568
00:47:30,035 --> 00:47:32,705
Just think of it as good will.

569
00:47:32,874 --> 00:47:34,104
All right, sir.

570
00:47:37,615 --> 00:47:38,914
I know her from college.

571
00:47:39,714 --> 00:47:41,584
She was a nice, smart kid.

572
00:47:58,664 --> 00:48:01,305
(To Jae Hyun)

573
00:48:45,575 --> 00:48:47,885
(Thanks to those moments that were as pretty as flowers,)

574
00:48:47,885 --> 00:48:49,885
(I think I can go on. Sorry and thank you. Jae Hyun.)

575
00:49:44,734 --> 00:49:47,075
These are the gloves you were looking for, sir.

576
00:49:47,345 --> 00:49:49,175
They are all new this season.

577
00:49:49,345 --> 00:49:50,444
Okay.

578
00:49:50,745 --> 00:49:52,544
Are they for your wife?

579
00:49:52,714 --> 00:49:53,885
No.

580
00:49:54,015 --> 00:49:56,155
Oh... All right, sir.

581
00:49:56,484 --> 00:49:58,515
You don't have to tell her, either.

582
00:49:59,055 --> 00:50:00,885
Of course, sir.

583
00:50:01,084 --> 00:50:02,325
I'll take these.

584
00:50:03,595 --> 00:50:04,655
Yes, sir.

585
00:50:15,164 --> 00:50:16,234
Yes?

586
00:50:16,504 --> 00:50:17,635
Mr. Han.

587
00:50:17,635 --> 00:50:19,175
Are you doing your job?

588
00:50:19,175 --> 00:50:20,405
I am, but...

589
00:50:20,405 --> 00:50:21,644
Ms. Yoon is...

590
00:50:21,644 --> 00:50:22,745
Is what?

591
00:50:23,214 --> 00:50:25,015
She's at the office, sir.

592
00:50:25,245 --> 00:50:26,245
What?

593
00:50:26,584 --> 00:50:29,185
(Cancel the unfair dismissal!)

594
00:50:32,115 --> 00:50:35,354
Young Min, how long are you going to keep ignoring my messages?

595
00:50:35,785 --> 00:50:37,854
This is foul play.

596
00:50:46,334 --> 00:50:48,734
(Cancel the unfair dismissal! Murderous Company, Hyung Sung Group)

597
00:50:50,734 --> 00:50:52,374
Should we keep watch?

598
00:50:52,944 --> 00:50:54,205
Forget it.

599
00:50:54,444 --> 00:50:55,475
Yes, sir.

600
00:50:55,644 --> 00:50:58,075
Good will, my foot. This is stalking.

601
00:50:59,984 --> 00:51:01,785
I'm sorry for asking you to do this.

602
00:51:01,785 --> 00:51:03,655
It's nothing, sir.

603
00:51:06,325 --> 00:51:08,754
Should I cancel the meeting you had today?

604
00:51:08,754 --> 00:51:11,024
- What meeting? - With the head of Seoul Bank.

605
00:51:13,325 --> 00:51:15,124
- I still have to work. - Yes, sir.

606
00:51:26,905 --> 00:51:27,944
You're right.

607
00:51:30,575 --> 00:51:31,874
"Three handsome sons-in-law..."

608
00:51:31,874 --> 00:51:33,714
"of conglomerate families everyone wants to date..."

609
00:51:34,115 --> 00:51:35,414
Whatever.

610
00:51:35,785 --> 00:51:37,685
He has a great figure. He could be an actor.

611
00:51:37,685 --> 00:51:40,185
He's still young, and he's already a vice-president.

612
00:51:40,185 --> 00:51:42,555
- Haven't you heard? - What?

613
00:51:43,155 --> 00:51:45,425
He's Jang Seo Kyung's husband.

614
00:51:45,455 --> 00:51:48,394
- Jang Seo Kyung. - You're right!

615
00:51:48,925 --> 00:51:51,234
The chairman was against the marriage,

616
00:51:51,535 --> 00:51:54,964
but Jang Seo Kyung caused a fit...

617
00:51:54,964 --> 00:51:56,405
and managed to make it work.

618
00:51:56,705 --> 00:51:59,504
He went to jail for the chairman and recently got discharged.

619
00:51:59,504 --> 00:52:00,944
- Really? - Let me see.

620
00:52:00,944 --> 00:52:02,874
- It says so here. - Give it!

621
00:52:02,874 --> 00:52:04,644
- Where? - Let go!

622
00:52:04,644 --> 00:52:06,584
- Gosh, what's wrong with you? - That hurt!

623
00:52:06,584 --> 00:52:07,914
- I couldn't see. - Goodness!

624
00:52:07,914 --> 00:52:10,285
- You could've waited your turn! - Gosh!

625
00:52:15,425 --> 00:52:17,394
(Three handsome sons-in-law of conglomerate families...)

626
00:52:17,394 --> 00:52:19,595
(everyone wants to date, Han Jae Hyun of Hyung Sung Group)

627
00:52:26,164 --> 00:52:28,164
(The marriage between the chairman's daughter and a mere employee)

628
00:52:51,694 --> 00:52:53,865
I will never agree on a settlement.

629
00:52:54,495 --> 00:52:56,834
Set up the School Violence Committee.

630
00:52:57,265 --> 00:52:58,294
But...

631
00:52:58,935 --> 00:53:00,964
Mr. Han said to never allow...

632
00:53:00,964 --> 00:53:04,175
And you should have stopped him.

633
00:53:04,334 --> 00:53:06,644
Even if it were Jun Seo's grandfather who came,

634
00:53:06,644 --> 00:53:09,104
- you should've stopped it. - I'm sorry, ma'am.

635
00:53:09,944 --> 00:53:12,314
I did tell him that we can't do that,

636
00:53:12,774 --> 00:53:14,615
but he insisted, saying he's a young boy.

637
00:53:14,615 --> 00:53:16,854
I don't want you to misunderstand me.

638
00:53:17,015 --> 00:53:19,214
Even if my son wasn't the victim,

639
00:53:19,214 --> 00:53:21,325
I would've wanted you to go by the rules.

640
00:53:21,484 --> 00:53:22,955
If we just let this pass,

641
00:53:22,955 --> 00:53:25,155
it will only humiliate the school.

642
00:53:26,394 --> 00:53:28,595
This school should be special, don't you think?

643
00:53:29,095 --> 00:53:30,765
Isn't that why parents...

644
00:53:30,765 --> 00:53:33,865
want to send their kids here at all costs?

645
00:53:36,035 --> 00:53:39,644
And it's also why I make such large donations here.

646
00:53:49,584 --> 00:53:51,584
(Han Jae Hyun of Hyung Sung Group)

647
00:53:51,584 --> 00:53:53,524
(The marriage between the chairman's daughter and a mere employee)

648
00:54:11,305 --> 00:54:12,334
Yes?

649
00:54:12,334 --> 00:54:14,444
I don't know what to tell you.

650
00:54:15,345 --> 00:54:16,515
Is something wrong?

651
00:54:17,115 --> 00:54:20,245
I think the School Violence Committee will be set up.

652
00:54:21,515 --> 00:54:22,644
Why, all of a sudden?

653
00:54:23,484 --> 00:54:26,185
Jun Seo's mother came to see us.

654
00:54:29,285 --> 00:54:33,164
She told us not to give you...

655
00:54:33,425 --> 00:54:34,894
her number.

656
00:54:35,124 --> 00:54:38,635
I don't think she wants to agree on a settlement.

657
00:54:38,635 --> 00:54:39,635
I see.

658
00:54:41,035 --> 00:54:42,135
What about...

659
00:54:43,305 --> 00:54:44,774
his father's number?

660
00:54:45,035 --> 00:54:46,845
- He said he would give... - I'm sorry.

661
00:54:46,845 --> 00:54:50,015
We can't give you that, either.

662
00:54:50,414 --> 00:54:52,345
- I'm really sorry. - Then...

663
00:54:53,914 --> 00:54:55,714
when will it be held?

664
00:55:03,354 --> 00:55:06,464
This will be a great opportunity for Seoul Bank as well.

665
00:55:06,825 --> 00:55:09,365
All right. Let's get it started.

666
00:55:09,624 --> 00:55:10,635
Thank you, sir.

667
00:55:14,734 --> 00:55:16,504
Go ahead. Take it.

668
00:55:17,075 --> 00:55:18,104
Excuse me.

669
00:55:21,874 --> 00:55:23,374
Yes? What is it?

670
00:55:23,774 --> 00:55:25,944
Dad, are you with Mom?

671
00:55:26,484 --> 00:55:27,515
No, why?

672
00:55:27,914 --> 00:55:30,854
I wanted to ask Mom what she said.

673
00:55:33,084 --> 00:55:34,155
What do you mean?

674
00:55:34,455 --> 00:55:36,655
They're going to hold the School Violence Committee...

675
00:55:36,655 --> 00:55:37,995
because of Mom.

676
00:55:40,164 --> 00:55:43,394
Yes. The head of Seoul Bank?

677
00:55:45,865 --> 00:55:46,865
All right.

678
00:55:48,635 --> 00:55:50,575
What is he up to?

679
00:55:56,104 --> 00:55:58,944
Excuse me. May I see Ms. Jang?

680
00:55:58,944 --> 00:56:00,144
Do you have an appointment?

681
00:56:00,984 --> 00:56:02,644
- Not really... - Then no, ma'am.

682
00:56:02,644 --> 00:56:04,055
You need to make an appointment.

683
00:56:04,655 --> 00:56:06,484
Is she in, though?

684
00:56:06,484 --> 00:56:07,825
I can't tell you, ma'am.

685
00:56:09,484 --> 00:56:10,495
Then...

686
00:56:11,254 --> 00:56:13,664
- What about Mr. Han? - It will be the same, ma'am.

687
00:56:13,865 --> 00:56:15,865
You cannot see them unless you have an appointment.

688
00:56:17,194 --> 00:56:18,265
Hey!

689
00:56:19,495 --> 00:56:20,504
What is it?

690
00:56:21,135 --> 00:56:22,334
What's wrong?

691
00:56:22,805 --> 00:56:24,305
You can't do this here.

692
00:56:24,935 --> 00:56:27,104
No, I'm not here because of the protest.

693
00:56:27,305 --> 00:56:28,774
Please let me call them, at least.

694
00:56:29,004 --> 00:56:30,745
You can't do this here. Please step outside.

695
00:56:30,745 --> 00:56:32,644
- No, I... - Please leave.

696
00:56:33,015 --> 00:56:34,314
- I... - Come, ma'am.

697
00:56:34,615 --> 00:56:35,714
What do you think you're doing?

698
00:56:36,655 --> 00:56:39,455
I told you not to change the decision.

699
00:56:39,925 --> 00:56:41,055
Why shouldn't I?

700
00:56:41,254 --> 00:56:43,655
It wasn't serious enough to ruin someone's life.

701
00:56:43,655 --> 00:56:45,225
You fire employees...

702
00:56:45,354 --> 00:56:46,765
and sue them for interfering...

703
00:56:46,765 --> 00:56:48,725
with your business so easily.

704
00:56:49,064 --> 00:56:50,834
Why are you worried about his life?

705
00:56:51,095 --> 00:56:52,194
He's a young boy.

706
00:56:53,064 --> 00:56:54,205
He's just 14.

707
00:56:54,405 --> 00:56:56,905
I'm sure you fired a truckload of people...

708
00:56:57,435 --> 00:56:59,274
who have kids that are younger.

709
00:57:00,745 --> 00:57:02,274
I'm saying we should play it by the rules.

710
00:57:02,644 --> 00:57:04,075
I'm not trying to teach the kid...

711
00:57:04,075 --> 00:57:05,874
who hit my baby a lesson.

712
00:57:07,584 --> 00:57:10,084
Well, I guess I can't say it's 100 percent not that.

713
00:57:20,124 --> 00:57:21,194
So, Young Min.

714
00:57:22,325 --> 00:57:24,664
Please tell me why you did it.

715
00:57:25,294 --> 00:57:28,164
I don't care if they hold the committee.

716
00:57:29,064 --> 00:57:30,575
Of course, you do.

717
00:57:31,435 --> 00:57:32,774
You said you liked school.

718
00:57:32,935 --> 00:57:34,845
You liked your teachers and said the class was fun.

719
00:57:36,104 --> 00:57:37,144
Young Min.

720
00:57:37,575 --> 00:57:40,345
I really don't believe you did anything wrong.

721
00:57:41,044 --> 00:57:44,254
I was just annoyed. At everything.

722
00:57:45,084 --> 00:57:46,084
"Just"?

723
00:57:47,385 --> 00:57:49,225
You did it without a reason?

724
00:57:49,725 --> 00:57:51,294
I'm almost in the eighth grade.

725
00:57:52,655 --> 00:57:53,964
I will be, soon.

726
00:57:55,464 --> 00:57:58,234
They say kids get moody then.

727
00:57:58,564 --> 00:58:01,104
Says who? That doesn't even make any sense!

728
00:58:01,104 --> 00:58:04,575
Isn't Dad coming tomorrow? What do I do?

729
00:58:36,004 --> 00:58:40,975
(Mom)

730
00:58:47,314 --> 00:58:50,555
(Mom...)

731
00:59:08,305 --> 00:59:09,305
(Building 2)

732
00:59:25,754 --> 00:59:26,984
Where's Seo Kyung?

733
00:59:27,725 --> 00:59:30,155
She just left for the school, sir.

734
01:00:04,425 --> 01:00:05,754
Don't worry, ma'am.

735
01:00:06,194 --> 01:00:09,064
We'll be careful not to let any rumors out.

736
01:00:10,564 --> 01:00:11,765
Of course, you should.

737
01:00:11,964 --> 01:00:14,765
It's just as embarrassing to be known as the victim.

738
01:00:19,604 --> 01:00:20,675
Ms. Yoon.

739
01:00:42,425 --> 01:00:43,564
I beg of you, ma'am.

740
01:00:44,334 --> 01:00:45,834
Please reconsider it.

741
01:00:46,664 --> 01:00:48,504
- The boy's future... - I'm doing this...

742
01:00:48,504 --> 01:00:50,175
for the boy's future, ma'am.

743
01:00:51,405 --> 01:00:52,705
Isn't it the adults' duty...

744
01:00:52,705 --> 01:00:55,104
to tell them what's right and wrong?

745
01:00:56,004 --> 01:00:58,374
It can't be good for his education...

746
01:00:58,374 --> 01:01:00,044
if we let it slide without punishment...

747
01:01:00,285 --> 01:01:02,314
when he committed a crime, don't you think?

748
01:01:03,214 --> 01:01:05,254
And for the other students, as well.

749
01:01:07,055 --> 01:01:08,084
If...

750
01:01:10,254 --> 01:01:12,394
the reason you're trying to hold...

751
01:01:13,254 --> 01:01:15,925
the committee is because it's your son...

752
01:01:15,995 --> 01:01:17,095
What did you say?

753
01:01:18,365 --> 01:01:20,905
Please take it out on me.

754
01:01:22,004 --> 01:01:23,805
It's my fault...

755
01:01:24,205 --> 01:01:25,805
for raising him poorly.

756
01:01:26,175 --> 01:01:27,944
You can take it out on me...

757
01:01:28,405 --> 01:01:29,975
however you like.

758
01:01:35,044 --> 01:01:38,185
However I like?

759
01:01:40,084 --> 01:01:42,655
Yes, ma'am. However.

760
01:01:46,694 --> 01:01:50,394
Then let's see what you can do...

761
01:01:50,865 --> 01:01:52,694
to relieve my anger.

762
01:02:31,405 --> 01:02:32,834
Please, ma'am.

763
01:02:33,944 --> 01:02:35,274
Forgive him...

764
01:02:36,345 --> 01:02:37,774
just this once.

765
01:02:53,024 --> 01:02:54,265
Please get up.

766
01:02:55,095 --> 01:02:57,694
What do you think you're doing?

767
01:02:57,964 --> 01:02:59,964
Get up, Yoon Ji Su!

768
01:03:45,475 --> 01:03:47,444
(When My Love Blooms)

769
01:03:48,984 --> 01:03:50,785
I can't help but think of the old days.

770
01:03:52,615 --> 01:03:53,655
Ji Su!

771
01:03:55,254 --> 01:03:56,885
It's been so long.

772
01:04:02,265 --> 01:04:03,765
Good luck, Ji Su.

773
01:04:04,635 --> 01:04:07,834
Just keep in mind that I'll be watching her.

774
01:04:08,205 --> 01:04:09,664
Are you asking me to leave them?

775
01:04:09,664 --> 01:04:11,834
I don't want you to suffer.

776
01:04:12,705 --> 01:04:13,774
No.

777
01:04:15,944 --> 01:04:17,115
I want to protect you.
