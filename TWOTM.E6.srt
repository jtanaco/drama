2
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:58,600
(Episode 6)

3
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,000
Joon Young.

4
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:17,730
Divorce isn't necessarily a bad thing.

5
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,400
No Eul also had a hard time accepting it at first...

6
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:30,710
I'll be right back.

7
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:40,250
Joon Young.

8
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:42,690
Joon Young.

9
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,890
Did my mom ask you...

10
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:48,530
to convince me since she's going to get a divorce?

11
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:49,860
No.

12
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,470
I'm just worried about you. That's all.

13
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,270
I just feel bad.

14
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:01,540
Why?

15
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:03,880
Why do you feel bad?

16
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:13,690
Do you know something?

17
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:17,290
Things will never be the same again.

18
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:20,660
Our marriage. Our son.

19
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,930
You're the one who ruined everything!

20
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:28,600
Do you finally get what you've done?

21
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:36,710
What did I do?

22
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,350
No.

23
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:44,020
Your viciousness is what ruined us.

24
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:49,390
You know how sad it is to grow up without a dad.

25
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,760
How could you say...

26
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:55,730
you'd do that to Joon Young in front of me?

27
00:02:58,370 --> 00:02:59,900
You have no right.

28
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,310
You have no right to take his dad from Joon Young.

29
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:12,410
No.

30
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:23,760
You're done already.

31
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:27,660
Joon Young saw everything.

32
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:31,100
He saw what you...

33
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,840
and Da Kyung were doing.

34
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,470
Sun Woo...

35
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:06,570
really is something.

36
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,940
I knew for a while now...

37
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,340
that you were having affairs.

38
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:13,910
No.

39
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:18,180
They never lasted more than a night, so they weren't affairs.

40
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:20,750
I guess it's more of an addiction.

41
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,560
Why are you acting this way if you knew already?

42
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,830
Because it's Sun Woo.

43
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:36,160
Why is that different?

44
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:40,770
Did you sleep with her?

45
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:43,640
I only enjoy them physically. I never have feelings for them.

46
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:49,110
In that way, Sun Woo is no different from other women.

47
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:53,310
Don't tell me you think I like her.

48
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:59,850
Are you proud of yourself because you didn't have feelings for them?

49
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:06,930
Do you...

50
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:11,000
hate me that much?

51
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,500
It's not that I hate you.

52
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:18,210
"I hate boredom" is a better way to put it.

53
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:24,310
What did you do while I was bored?

54
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:29,280
Shouldn't a couple fix each other's inadequacies...

55
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:32,690
and find fun together?

56
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:35,520
I can't seem to do that.

57
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,890
There's nothing left to talk about then.

58
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:46,230
Fine. I'm the problem.

59
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:52,810
I admit I'm not normal.

60
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:54,910
Are you...

61
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,280
even sorry?

62
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,400
Why are you here like this?

63
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:56,800
Sorry.

64
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,140
I'm really sorry.

65
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:09,820
Did you really go out with me for my dad's money?

66
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:12,990
If even you believe what that psycho said,

67
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:16,490
nothing I say now will matter.

68
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:20,530
The chairman invested in my work.

69
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:25,030
He decided based purely on my passion and work.

70
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:45,150
Put the cigarette out.

71
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,690
Put it out.

72
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:52,590
It's bad for the baby.

73
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:07,310
I can...

74
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:10,140
give up everything.

75
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:12,880
My mom,

76
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:15,250
my dad,

77
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:18,750
and everything I enjoyed thanks to my dad.

78
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:23,190
Da Kyung.

79
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:28,430
The choice is yours now.

80
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:49,680
Thank you.

81
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,390
Thank you so much.

82
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:40,670
Did you see him?

83
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:43,170
Why are you doing this to me?

84
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,580
I said...

85
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:54,280
I would tell you everything...

86
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,720
if a situation arises that you need to know about.

87
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:13,700
You are so sickening.

88
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:16,440
You think you're so cool, don't you?

89
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,970
You probably think others think the same, but get over yourself.

90
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:24,080
You are garbage. That's what you are.

91
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:28,950
What about you, who went on a trip with my husband's mistress?

92
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:33,390
You're garbage just like me.

93
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,820
So?

94
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:38,790
Did you want to get revenge on me?

95
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:43,500
Is that why you slept with my husband?

96
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:47,370
Yes.

97
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,480
You must have wanted...

98
00:10:56,910 --> 00:11:00,250
to destroy our marriage because yours was destroyed, but no.

99
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,620
You failed.

100
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:05,390
You couldn't save your marriage,

101
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:07,350
but I will save mine.

102
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:11,660
This won't threaten our marriage at all.

103
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:14,930
I don't care one bit...

104
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,430
whether or not you get divorced. I simply...

105
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:22,900
wanted to tell you the truth.

106
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,840
Because that's how I felt.

107
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:28,910
Because deceiving even you, whom I considered a friend,

108
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:36,480
made me unbearably sad.

109
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:39,550
You are a total fake.

110
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:43,820
I have never...

111
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,460
considered you a friend.

112
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,100
Is that right?

113
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:57,370
Had I known that was how you felt,

114
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:02,180
I would've been less sad.

115
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:39,650
You're home.

116
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:42,720
Where's Joon Young?

117
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:55,160
My daughter and I'll get going.

118
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,330
Bye.

119
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:02,800
Mi Yun.

120
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:07,170
Thank you.

121
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:29,100
Where's Dad?

122
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,940
He won't be coming home.

123
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,580
Until when?

124
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:59,830
(A World of Married Couple)

125
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:25,450
We won't break up anymore, right?

126
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:29,060
Of course not.

127
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:31,960
We'll sleep in the same bed together,

128
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,560
and wake up together too.

129
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,430
We can stay together all day long, right?

130
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:46,340
I'll stay by your side all day.

131
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:49,040
By our baby too.

132
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,620
I'll be a supportive wife.

133
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:01,660
Your film...

134
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:05,560
is going to be a huge success.

135
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:11,160
Yes.

136
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,440
Is there a problem?

137
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:24,040
I have a feeling the production might not happen.

138
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,320
What do you mean?

139
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,550
As you already know,

140
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,260
your father's really upset.

141
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:39,290
His investment will be pulled out,

142
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:41,030
so unless I find a new investor...

143
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:42,400
Are you saying...

144
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:45,800
you don't have any other investors?

145
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:50,940
The thing is,

146
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:54,780
making a film isn't that easy.

147
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,510
I see.

148
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:26,910
(Speed Quick)

149
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:28,780
Hello, are you Lee Tae Oh?

150
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,350
Yes.

151
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:34,280
Could you sign here?

152
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:40,490
Here are your documents.

153
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:43,460
Thank you.

154

(Application for Uncontested Divorce)

155
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:55,470
(Wife: Ji Sun Woo)

156
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:57,800
- Who was that? - What is this?

157
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,070
This is ridiculous.

158
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:02,540
Don't waste time and take care of it fast.

159
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:05,880
No fool would agree to give up on all the money and his kid.

160
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:08,220
You lived off of the money I earned until now.

161
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:09,850
There was never a thing you owned.

162
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:13,450
Who raised Joon Young while you were in training?

163
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:15,020
Don't you remember?

164
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:18,030
I played a part in helping you get your license.

165
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:19,590
Fine.

166
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:22,260
If you want to play it that way,

167
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,670
I won't go easy on you.

168
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:27,530
What are you going to do about it?

169
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:29,940
You founded a company with my money,

170
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,410
then you pocketed a slush fund.

171
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:35,380
I'll charge you for embezzlement.

172
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:39,610
- How are you going to do that? - Don't worry.

173
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,250
The employees who didn't get their paychecks...

174
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:43,950
thanks to their incompetent boss decided to help me.

175
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:03,340
(Application for Uncontested Divorce)

176
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:05,710
How does she know my address?

177
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:09,140
Did you tell her?

178
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,280
No.

179
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,880
Since when did she...

180
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,750
How much does she know about us?

181
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:22,220
She gives me goosebumps.

182
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,530
Welcome.

183
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,450
Where's Min Hyun Seo?

184
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:51,320
She quit.

185
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:53,750
Don't lie.

186
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:56,690
I mean it. She quit a few days ago.

187
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:11,570
Where did she run off to?

188
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:22,020
Where's Hyun Seo?

189
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,550
Where did you hide her?

190
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,420
Why are you asking me?

191
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,460
I thought you two were together.

192
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,860
Why aren't you sending me the money? Hurry up and send it.

193
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:36,000
I don't have any money.

194
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:38,630
If you want to report it, go ahead. I don't care.

195
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:43,100
Are you pushing your luck?

196
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:45,140
You already have a criminal record for assault and fraud.

197
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:47,840
If you want to add another charge for blackmailing, I won't stop you.

198
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,840
Do whatever you want.

199
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:52,510
I won't just sit and watch.

200
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:23,740
Hello.

201
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:26,750
- Hello, Dr. Ji. - Hello.

202
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:28,820
Good morning.

203
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:40,390
Did something happen? Something feels strange.

204
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:43,300
Hurry up and take a look at the hospital's website.

205
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:45,800
Our website?

206
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:51,740
It started late last night.

207
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:56,110
Nurse Kim first noticed it and requested it to be deleted.

208
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:59,180
But the more they deleted it, the worse it became.

209
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:03,150
It's spreading in community blogs and personal social media accounts.

210
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:05,550
It spread so much and is out of control.

211
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:08,990
I only found out a while ago.

212
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:11,660
I don't know who it is,

213
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:14,460
but they definitely want to give you a hard time.

214
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:15,730
Do you have anyone in mind?

215
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:19,770
Who could it be?

216
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:24,300
Could it be Mr. Ha Dong Shik?

217
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:26,570
Or is it someone else?

218
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:31,380
Hey, who was that man who came to see you before?

219
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:34,350
He didn't look like a patient.

220
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:37,080
Could it be him?

221
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,020
My goodness.

222
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:41,960
What's the point of finding out who wrote these?

223
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,760
It's fine as long as it's not you.

224
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,460
You tend to be too sensitive these days.

225
00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:50,760
I only said it out of concern.

226
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,570
It's normal for patients to make complaints.

227
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:58,100
It'll quiet down in time.

228
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:00,570
You should go back to work.

229
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:03,010
If it started during the night,

230
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,710
it could be your husband too.

231
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,450
Why would he do such a thing?

232
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:11,920
If your reputation gets ruined,

233
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:14,350
it'll put your husband in a favorable position.

234
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:17,990
You said he doesn't want to give up on your son's custody.

235
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:38,280
So who do you want to live with?

236
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:43,720
Haven't you decided yet?

237
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,490
Stop being so annoying.

238
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,760
I need to go to the office.

239
00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:01,070
I'll talk to my dad and convince him to invest in you.

240
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:04,200
This isn't the right time to talk to him about money.

241
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,570
He might not even approve of our relationship.

242
00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:08,980
Let me take care of what's urgent first.

243
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,150
Just hurry up and get a divorce.

244
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:20,250
I should get myself a lawyer so we can rewrite the agreement.

245
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:22,320
I'm not going to let her have everything she wants.

246
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:24,520
Why can't you...

247
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,730
give up on your son?

248
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,870
- Because he's my son. - Then what?

249
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,500
What do you plan to do with him?

250
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:41,740
- He'll live with me. Then... - What about our baby?

251
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:44,580
How do you expect me to bear with that?

252
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:46,050
I'll take care of it, okay?

253
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:47,750
Hey, you two.

254
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,750
Where is Min Hyun Seo?

255
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:57,620
Why are you asking me?

256
00:23:58,460 --> 00:23:59,730
I don't know where she is.

257
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,160
You guys used to talk to each other all night.

258
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,930
And now, you're acting like you don't know her?

259
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,630
Listen.

260
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:08,840
Why are you trying to start a fight with a stranger?

261
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:11,000
How is she supposed to know where her neighbor is?

262
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:21,480
"A stranger"?

263
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:25,890
Do you know your wife used my girlfriend...

264
00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:27,450
to keep a tail on you?

265
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:54,950
What do you want?

266
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:57,250
Do you want to get a divorce?

267
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,880
Just tell me. I'll get a divorce if that's what you want.

268
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,290
I'm not getting a divorce.

269
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:41,290
I don't have a job or any kids.

270
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:44,330
If I don't even get my dad's money, I'd be left with nothing.

271
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,270
You're going to forgive me...

272
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:49,870
because you won't be able to get his inheritance...

273
00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:53,670
if you get a divorce?

274
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:57,180
Not getting a divorce doesn't mean I'm going to forgive you.

275
00:25:58,110 --> 00:25:59,210
Get changed.

276
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:02,720
Then what do you want?

277
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:05,020
I don't care how you feel.

278
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:08,890
Just do your best as my husband.

279
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,820
And I want you to cooperate so we can have a baby.

280
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:25,310
Okay, fine. I'll stop seeing other women.

281
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,410
Instead,

282
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:31,280
I'm not going to have a baby.

283
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:43,320
Who's my next patient?

284
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:48,960
There aren't any more patients, Dr. Ji.

285
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:53,400
The other patients canceled their appointments.

286
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:04,280
What should we do, Dr. Ji?

287
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,710
Should we call the cops?

288
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,850
If he's here to get treated, you can send him in.

289
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:15,260
Then I'll be there, too.

290
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:29,740
The cops told me you refused to press any charges...

291
00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:33,710
and that I don't even need to compensate for the broken computer.

292
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,240
Is that true?

293
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:39,280
You came here to check that?

294
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:43,450
No, I came to apologize.

295
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:45,720
I'm sorry.

296
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:51,420
I decided to take your advice and see a psychiatrist.

297
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:01,070
That's great.

298
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:03,500
I wish you all the best with your treatment.

299
00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:05,640
Okay.

300
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:15,980
You're a great doctor.

301
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,420
I came here to tell you that.

302
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,770
What do you think? Not too bad for my first time, right?

303
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,940
Did you tell him to compliment me like that?

304
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:42,580
Not at all.

305
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:49,280
Ji Sun Woo speaking.

306
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,420
Come in.

307
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:01,230
You asked for me?

308
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:18,190
I told you everything I have to say, so I'll be off now.

309
00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:26,460
You should've given me my money when I asked for it.

310
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:38,310
- Sir. - Is it true...

311
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:41,680
that you assaulted and threatened that man to have him placed...

312
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,280
in a mental institution against his will?

313
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:45,410
He assaulted my patient.

314
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:47,880
- It was an act of self-defense. - Then...

315
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:51,690
what about the fact that you asked your patient to tail your husband?

316
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:54,420
I know we had problems, but how could you...

317
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:56,660
ask your patient to tail me?

318
00:29:57,330 --> 00:29:58,530
You're a doctor.

319
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:00,730
Why are you here?

320
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:02,470
I'll be honest.

321
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:05,700
I'm really worried about my wife.

322
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:08,500
Did you see all those posts on the hospital website?

323
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:11,170
First, why don't we check who uploaded them, sir?

324
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:14,880
Someone's obviously trying to frame me.

325
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,880
You're the one who's trying to frame me.

326
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,820
How long have you been planning to get a divorce?

327
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:23,290
Dr. Ji, are you getting a divorce?

328
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:24,650
It's my private life, sir.

329
00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:27,290
Well, you've obviously crossed the line.

330
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,590
What you did is not only against medical ethics,

331
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:31,290
but it's even bad enough to receive criminal punishment.

332
00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:34,530
If people find out that you used your patient for personal purposes,

333
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:37,000
it'll inflict huge damage to the hospital!

334
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
I'll receive whatever punishment...

335
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,870
that I deserve. But can we please...

336
00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:49,510
talk about this without my husband? He doesn't even work here.

337
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:52,050
Okay, fine.

338
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,320
I know I made a mistake by cheating on you.

339
00:30:57,690 --> 00:31:00,090
But you put a tail on me and even assaulted and threatened someone.

340
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:03,890
None of that is normal.

341
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:06,460
How do you expect me to trust you with Joon Young...

342
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:08,060
when you're not completely sane?

343
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,300
Is this about Joon Young?

344
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,710
You want to make me seem insane...

345
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:18,810
so you could take him away from me?

346
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:20,410
You're obviously not normal.

347
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:22,080
What are you talking about?

348
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:24,980
Does Dr. Kong know that both your parents died...

349
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:27,150
due to an unexpected accident?

350
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,720
Did you tell him that the accident was suspicious?

351
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,590
- Shut it. - You told me yourself...

352
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:35,560
that your mom was strange that day.

353
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:40,230
That she, who was driving, may have done it on purpose.

354
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:43,270
That she was having a really tough time...

355
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:45,700
after finding out your dad was cheating, and...

356
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,150
Are you...

357
00:32:03,150 --> 00:32:05,050
confident you won't end up like your mom?

358
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:09,960
Doctor.

359
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:14,930
May I request a psychiatric evaluation of Dr. Ji Sun Woo?

360
00:32:16,530 --> 00:32:19,040
I think I'll need it in our custody hearing.

361
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,040
You scumbag.

362
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,950
You won't get your way.

363
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,990
Dr. Ji!

364
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:57,990
Sun Woo!

365
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:00,360
What are you doing?

366
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:03,670
What are you thinking?

Mom?

369
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:22,980
Get up.

370
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:34,920
- Ma'am. - Mr. Lee.

371
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,530
Where's Joon Young?

372
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:40,300
His mother just picked him up.

373
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:43,800
Is something wrong?

374
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:46,540
I'm sorry, but I'm in a rush.

375
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:47,540
Okay.

376
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:06,190

00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:00,800

Give it back. Give me my phone!

I'll buy you a new one, so sit still.

393

Where are we going? Answer me!

394
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:33,970
I'll explain later.

395
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:36,910
I'm calling Dad.

396
00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:39,010
Give me that.

397
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:41,140
Give it to me!

398
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,980
You're not in your right mind!

399
00:39:45,310 --> 00:39:46,350
Joon Young.

400

(Sun Woo)

401
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:53,560
Hello? Where are you?

402
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:55,720
- Dad. Dad! - Joon Young.

403
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:56,830
Lee Joon Young!

404
00:39:57,660 --> 00:39:59,800
Mom. Look ahead. Look.

405
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,200
Careful!

406
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,440
What happened?

407
00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:11,470
Joon Young, are you okay?

408
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:13,140

Hello?

412
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,920
- Hang up. - Are you with Mom?

413
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:28,260
- Now. - Joon Young!

414

Hello?

415
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:34,660
Hello?

416
00:40:56,850 --> 00:40:59,090
The phone is turned off.

417
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,860
My son is missing.

418
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:06,660
I can't get through.

419
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:10,070
How many times must I tell you?

420
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:12,300
His mom took him out of class.

421
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:15,770
I can't reach her either, that's why!

422
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:20,980
I think they were in an accident.

423
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:24,310
I'm asking you to check. That's why I called.

424
00:41:28,850 --> 00:41:31,020
What do you mean, call after the accident happens?

425
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:34,220
Hello?

426
00:41:36,090 --> 00:41:37,160
Hello?

427
00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:42,320
Get out.

428
00:43:43,390 --> 00:43:44,520
Joon Young.

429
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:23,530
I'm...

430
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,100
very angry right now.

431
00:44:37,310 --> 00:44:38,870
I'll apologize...

432
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:42,410
for yelling at you and for throwing out your phone.

433
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:48,780
I'm also sorry for bringing you here...

434
00:44:50,350 --> 00:44:51,420
against your will.

435
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:57,160
You know...

436
00:44:58,730 --> 00:45:00,500
why I'm acting like this, don't you?

437
00:45:01,030 --> 00:45:02,800
It's because Dad has another woman, right?

438
00:45:05,730 --> 00:45:07,900
So what? What about it?

439
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:12,510
He betrayed us.

440
00:45:15,110 --> 00:45:16,450
You know everything, don't you?

441
00:45:16,450 --> 00:45:17,780
He betrayed you,

442
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:20,820
not me.

443
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:28,820
That woman's pregnant.

444
00:45:30,130 --> 00:45:32,130
Dad doesn't need us anymore, Joon Young.

445
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:36,500
So?

446
00:45:37,430 --> 00:45:38,700
Did he say he'll live with her?

447
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:42,670
Does he love that baby more than he loves me?

448
00:45:50,350 --> 00:45:51,450
It's okay.

449
00:45:52,510 --> 00:45:54,820
We can live happily on our own.

450
00:45:56,750 --> 00:45:59,020
It won't be a problem even without him.

451
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:03,160
No. I don't want to live with just you.

452
00:46:08,030 --> 00:46:09,160
Do you not want to?

453
00:46:10,670 --> 00:46:11,930
Don't get a divorce.

454
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:15,600
You can forgive him this time.

455
00:46:15,970 --> 00:46:17,770
Just forgive him.

456
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:21,780
I can't.

457
00:46:23,910 --> 00:46:26,450
Dad decided to live with that woman.

458
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:27,880
How can we live without Dad?

459
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:29,620
You're always busy.

460
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:31,650
You care more about work than me.

461
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:37,730
It was Dad who stayed with me.

462
00:46:39,860 --> 00:46:41,330
You were never around.

463
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:45,900
Don't you know why I lived that way?

464
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:50,540
I did it for you.

465
00:46:52,770 --> 00:46:55,610
I did it so I could give you everything you need.

466
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:02,220
You're the most precious thing to me.

467
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:06,490
You're all I have.

468
00:47:08,060 --> 00:47:10,560
- Don't you see that? - Don't lie to me.

469
00:47:12,430 --> 00:47:13,630
I'm going to go to Dad.

470
00:47:13,860 --> 00:47:15,060
Where is he right now?

471
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:21,440
If you go to him, I'll die.

472
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:23,940
Will you still go to him?

473
00:47:24,770 --> 00:47:26,880
Don't you care if I die?

474
00:47:32,710 --> 00:47:33,850
Answer me.

475
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:35,580
Tell me you'll live with me.

476
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:41,720
Answer me!

477
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:42,960
Let me go.

478
00:47:44,730 --> 00:47:45,930
I'm scared.

479
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:48,600
Answer me!

480
00:48:01,870 --> 00:48:03,070
Is this your son's?

481
00:48:05,370 --> 00:48:06,510
Yes, it is.

482
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:09,410
It's Joon Young's.

483
00:48:10,580 --> 00:48:13,520
We checked where he last had a signal, and it was here.

484
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:15,850
This is as much as we can do.

485
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:18,250
Were there any reported accidents?

486
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:20,090
No, none.

487
00:48:20,690 --> 00:48:23,790
He seems to be with his mom. You should wait at home.

488
00:48:24,390 --> 00:48:25,960
Let's go. Get in.

489
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:37,170
(Sun Woo)

490
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:40,840
- Where are you? - Come home.

491
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:43,750
We'll talk in person.

492
00:49:20,010 --> 00:49:21,180
Where's Joon Young?

493
00:49:22,380 --> 00:49:23,490
Where is he?

494
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:33,630
Joon Young!

495
00:49:35,730 --> 00:49:36,870
Joon Young!

496
00:49:46,540 --> 00:49:48,940
Where's Joon Young?

497
00:49:57,490 --> 00:49:59,820
Are you sure you want to live with him?

498
00:50:00,860 --> 00:50:02,420
Did that woman agree?

499
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:05,960
Are you going to tell Joon Young to call that woman...

500
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:09,430
you cheated with as his stepmom?

501
00:50:10,770 --> 00:50:12,470
You make me sick.

502
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:14,970
Didn't I apologize enough?

503
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:16,810
How much more should I beg?

504
00:50:16,810 --> 00:50:17,970
You don't realize it, do you?

505
00:50:20,180 --> 00:50:23,080
You never apologized.

506
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:33,660
It's over now.

507
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:39,890
You can't see Joon Young anymore.

508
00:50:42,130 --> 00:50:43,230
What's that supposed to mean?

509
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:52,340
You shouldn't have talked about my mom.

510
00:50:56,740 --> 00:50:58,610
I barely managed to forget about it.

511
00:51:03,150 --> 00:51:05,150
But you made me remember everything again.

512
00:51:05,150 --> 00:51:06,890
Cut the nonsense and just tell me...

513
00:51:06,890 --> 00:51:08,420
where Joon Young is!

514
00:51:15,460 --> 00:51:16,600
What did you do...

515
00:51:19,570 --> 00:51:20,740
to Joon Young?

516
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:23,540
You're the one who destroyed our family.

517
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:30,410
But he took your side.

518
00:51:32,850 --> 00:51:36,020
Stop being crazy if you don't want me to kill you.

519
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:38,890
Why don't you just go ahead and kill me?

520
00:51:39,020 --> 00:51:41,160
I don't want to live anymore!

521
00:51:41,290 --> 00:51:42,320
What?

522
00:51:44,890 --> 00:51:45,930
No way.

523
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:48,560
Tell me I'm wrong.

524
00:51:50,430 --> 00:51:51,930
There's no way you would've done that.

525
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:56,500
Tell me I'm wrong!

526
00:52:01,510 --> 00:52:03,540
I can do anything...

527
00:52:06,750 --> 00:52:08,150
to make you suffer.

528
00:52:14,260 --> 00:52:18,730
How do you feel to have lost your child?

529
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:24,270
You're the one who made me do this.

530
00:52:25,670 --> 00:52:26,770
Do you understand?

531
00:52:29,710 --> 00:52:30,870
You crazy witch.

532
00:52:35,510 --> 00:52:36,580
Die.

533
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:40,950
Die!

534
00:53:40,410 --> 00:53:41,540
You darn psycho.

535
00:55:09,770 --> 00:55:10,870
Joon Young.

536
00:55:14,340 --> 00:55:16,210
Thank goodness.

537
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:22,510
Joon Young.

538
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:34,790
No, it's not what you think. Joon Young.

539
00:55:35,390 --> 00:55:38,030
- Listen to me, Joon Young. - Don't call my name.

540
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:43,100
I'm not your son anymore.

541
00:56:03,890 --> 00:56:05,650
Sun Woo. Sun Woo.

542
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:09,190
Sun Woo. Sun Woo.

543
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:49,630
Mom.

544
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:51,930
Mom!

545
00:56:53,540 --> 00:56:55,340
- Mom! - Hello? 911?

546
00:56:55,900 --> 00:56:58,040
- We need an ambulance. Hurry. - Mom!

547
00:56:58,640 --> 00:56:59,980
Someone got severely injured.

548
00:57:17,290 --> 00:57:20,030
He agreed to all your terms.

549
00:57:22,970 --> 00:57:24,270
(Divorce settlement agreement)

550
00:57:25,670 --> 00:57:28,700
The court also issued a temporary restraining order.

551
00:57:45,820 --> 00:57:47,860
(Lee Tae Oh, Ji Sun Woo)

552
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:49,890
You finally got what you want.

553
00:57:51,060 --> 00:57:52,090
Congratulations.

554
00:58:43,050 --> 00:58:45,750
(From The National Health Insurance Corporation, To Lee Tae Oh)

555
00:58:51,690 --> 00:58:54,720
(Writ of Garnishment)

556
00:59:04,030 --> 00:59:06,100
My wife was really shocked that day.

557
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:08,870
So she wrote some stuff on the online notice board...

558
00:59:11,610 --> 00:59:13,480
of the hospital website out of anger.

559
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:16,850
Please let me apologize on her behalf.

560
00:59:19,050 --> 00:59:23,050
This is a small town, and your reputation matters.

561
00:59:23,390 --> 00:59:24,650
What she did...

562
00:59:25,620 --> 00:59:27,560
was very disrespectful to you.

563
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:30,230
And I know...

564
00:59:32,260 --> 00:59:35,830
that it will only remain as a civil case.

565
00:59:38,230 --> 00:59:40,640
But can you please not sue Da Kyung for having destroyed your marriage?

566
00:59:44,910 --> 00:59:45,940
What...

567
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:48,210
do you need me to do?

568
00:59:51,550 --> 00:59:53,320
Are you proposing a deal?

569
00:59:57,720 --> 01:00:00,620
My goodness, look at her. She's so brazen.

570
01:00:01,060 --> 01:00:02,160
She's unbelievable.

571
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:05,060
I know. I can't believe she still lives here.

572
01:00:06,860 --> 01:00:08,400
She's ruining the reputation of our neighborhood.

573
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:11,000
She's shopping for groceries after having destroyed a family?

574
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,570
She's got some nerve.

575
01:00:13,940 --> 01:00:15,100
My gosh.

576
01:00:23,450 --> 01:00:25,780
Will you look at her? What is she even doing here?

577
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:28,220
This card was declined.

578
01:00:31,150 --> 01:00:33,820
That can't be. Please try again.

579
01:00:35,890 --> 01:00:37,030
(Swipe card)

580
01:00:37,030 --> 01:00:38,190
(Transaction denied. Please try again.)

581
01:00:39,330 --> 01:00:40,560
It was rejected.

582
01:00:44,070 --> 01:00:46,200
How can you suddenly freeze my credit cards?

583
01:00:46,670 --> 01:00:48,040
You said to stay out of it.

584
01:00:49,140 --> 01:00:50,770
Doesn't that jerk give you money for expenses?

585
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:53,140
Must you go this far?

586
01:01:02,820 --> 01:01:03,890
Daddy.

587
01:01:04,850 --> 01:01:07,620
Can't you help Tae Oh? He's talented.

588
01:01:08,290 --> 01:01:10,190
He'll succeed if you support him.

589
01:01:10,190 --> 01:01:13,400
Is that why he bled his wife dry all these years?

590
01:01:13,630 --> 01:01:17,200
Da Kyung. Why are you such a poor judge of people?

591
01:01:18,130 --> 01:01:19,330
Shut it and get out.

592
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:21,940
I'll pretend I don't have a daughter.

593
01:01:29,080 --> 01:01:30,180
Daddy.

594
01:01:34,180 --> 01:01:35,580
Please.

595
01:01:37,550 --> 01:01:38,650
Please, Daddy.

596
01:01:42,090 --> 01:01:43,190
Da Kyung.

597
01:01:47,460 --> 01:01:49,060
It's not too late.

598
01:01:49,300 --> 01:01:50,500
Break up with him.

599
01:01:51,270 --> 01:01:55,000
If you do, Daddy will take care of you...

600
01:01:55,700 --> 01:01:57,340
and the baby.

601
01:01:57,970 --> 01:01:59,980
Listen to me.

602
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:02,710
Okay?

603
01:02:04,150 --> 01:02:05,810
I love him.

604
01:02:08,680 --> 01:02:10,050
I can't leave him.

605
01:02:14,660 --> 01:02:16,660
He hit his wife in front of his child...

606
01:02:16,660 --> 01:02:18,690
and was arrested for assault.

607
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:20,930
But what? Love?

608
01:02:21,430 --> 01:02:23,930
- Have you lost your mind? - It's not like that!

609
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:29,600
That woman set him up.

610
01:02:32,140 --> 01:02:33,310
Daddy.

611
01:02:39,350 --> 01:02:40,480
Fine.

612
01:02:43,750 --> 01:02:45,190
Pretend you don't have a daughter anymore.

613
01:02:48,290 --> 01:02:49,420
I won't come back.

614
01:03:27,330 --> 01:03:28,460
I reported...

615
01:03:29,700 --> 01:03:31,300
In Kyu for assault.

616
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:35,500
The lawyer says he won't get out easily because he has...

617
01:03:36,500 --> 01:03:38,010
several priors.

618
01:03:39,210 --> 01:03:40,380
That's good.

619
01:03:42,910 --> 01:03:44,550
It's thanks to you.

620
01:03:45,050 --> 01:03:46,410
I didn't do anything.

621
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:49,380
It was all you.

622
01:03:50,050 --> 01:03:51,920
You showed me by example...

623
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:55,520
how to get out of it.

624
01:04:00,300 --> 01:04:02,430
I used your situation.

625
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:06,670
I'm the one who said to use it as much as you wanted.

626
01:04:07,940 --> 01:04:09,000
Why did you do it?

627
01:04:11,340 --> 01:04:12,540
What about you?

628
01:04:17,010 --> 01:04:19,480
You were the first person to help me...

629
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:24,590
when I was being hit.

630
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:30,530
Why did you get so involved and go so far...

631
01:04:34,700 --> 01:04:35,900
to save me?

632
01:05:03,990 --> 01:05:05,260
Did you go out?

633
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:10,630
I think the hospital director made a big miscalculation.

634
01:05:11,700 --> 01:05:15,640
Psychiatry is going to be a big minus in our profits.

635
01:05:17,510 --> 01:05:21,440
Should I go out and market myself if I want to stay on?

636
01:05:30,990 --> 01:05:34,090
Divorce is like a war, right?

637
01:05:34,660 --> 01:05:35,990
There's no winner or loser.

638
01:05:39,690 --> 01:05:40,960
I know from experience.

639
01:05:49,940 --> 01:05:51,540
Albeit it was unconventional,

640
01:05:53,340 --> 01:05:56,180
I found out the source of your trauma,

641
01:05:56,710 --> 01:05:58,780
so why don't you try receiving treatment for it?

642
01:05:58,950 --> 01:06:01,320
I'm pretty well-respected in Seoul.

643
01:06:02,780 --> 01:06:03,990
I'm fine.

644
01:06:05,250 --> 01:06:07,360
Do you have experience treating alcoholics?

645
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:09,660
I would like to make a referral.

646
01:06:10,230 --> 01:06:11,330
Who?

647
01:06:14,200 --> 01:06:17,830
(Doctor Ji Sun Woo)

648
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:22,100
How's your injury?

649
01:06:22,570 --> 01:06:24,940
- Are you okay? - I'm okay.

650
01:06:25,710 --> 01:06:26,840
It's all better.

651
01:06:33,150 --> 01:06:34,920
Joon Young was shocked too, wasn't he?

652
01:06:35,650 --> 01:06:37,120
That psycho jerk.

653
01:06:37,490 --> 01:06:39,620
How dare he beat you up?

654
01:06:41,060 --> 01:06:42,190
Good job.

655
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:46,460
You can live with a cheater, but not with someone who's violent.

656
01:06:48,860 --> 01:06:50,100
Sorry about everything.

657
01:06:51,030 --> 01:06:53,070
I took our my annoyance at you.

658
01:06:53,070 --> 01:06:55,470
Don't be. I'm the one who's sorry.

659
01:06:57,010 --> 01:07:00,310
I really wronged you in so many ways, Sun Woo.

660
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:05,280
Hey, have you heard?

661
01:07:06,110 --> 01:07:07,480
Tae Oh is leaving Gosan.

662
01:07:09,220 --> 01:07:11,750
The rumors have spread everywhere in this tiny city.

663
01:07:11,750 --> 01:07:13,350
How could he stick around?

664
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:17,290
He must have some shame. He's moving somewhere no one knows him.

665
01:07:18,790 --> 01:07:21,500
Anyway, congrats on your new start.

666
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:23,300
I wish you only happiness going forward.

667
01:07:26,230 --> 01:07:29,100
You should date if you find a nice guy...

668
01:07:29,840 --> 01:07:30,940
and show that jerk.

669
01:07:31,710 --> 01:07:33,210
Don't jinx me.

670
01:07:33,510 --> 01:07:34,810
I'm sick of men.

671
01:07:35,840 --> 01:07:36,980
See you.

672
01:09:13,410 --> 01:09:14,510
Joon Young?

673
01:09:15,880 --> 01:09:17,310
I'm home.

674
01:09:27,460 --> 01:09:28,660
