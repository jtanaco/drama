<b>[ To do that, ]</b>

34

<b>I should be able to join hands</b>

<b>I see a lot of familiar faces here today.</b>

71

<b>But you might be a bit thrown off
by my introduction.</b>

72

<b>I used to be the former representative

- "Someone else's clothes"? ]</b>

<b>[ Today, at this opening event, ]</b>

<b>I want to expose Bella's impersonator
who has been deceiving you the whole time</b>

93
00:07:21,535 --> 00:07:25,175
<b>and a man who put the impersonator
in Bella's place</b>

94
00:07:25,235 --> 00:07:27,940
<b>and has been controlling her
behind the curtains.</b>

95
00:07:29,105 --> 00:07:30,270
<b>- What?
- What's she saying?</b>

96
00:07:31,175 --> 00:07:34,240
<b>There are two mannequins here.</b>

97
00:07:35,445 --> 00:07:36,680
<b>One</b>

98
00:07:37,715 --> 00:07:39,710
<b>has been made by fake Bella,</b>

99
00:07:40,225 --> 00:07:43,790
<b>and the other has been made
by Bella herself.</b>

100
00:07:44,525 --> 00:07:46,250
<b>[ - Hurry, everyone.
- Okay. ]</b>

101
00:07:46,355 --> 00:07:49,290
<b>- My goodness.
- Did it start already?</b>

102
00:07:49,665 --> 00:07:52,090
<b>They are going to expose
the fake Bella now.</b>

103
00:07:52,165 --> 00:07:55,435
<b>My goodness. I can tell which one it is
just by looking at them.</b>

104
00:07:55,505 --> 00:07:57,970
<b>I can't tell even if I'm staring at them.</b>

105
00:07:58,075 --> 00:07:59,829
<b>- How can you not tell?
- What?</b>

106
00:07:59,905 --> 00:08:01,805
<b>[ They are similar to our uniform. ]</b>

107
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:03,205
<b>- The one on the right.
- The right one.</b>

108
00:08:03,275 --> 00:08:05,775
<b>I was just going to say
it was the one on the right.</b>

109
00:08:05,845 --> 00:08:08,015
<b>I'll follow Hyo-sook
and say it's the one on the right.</b>

110
00:08:08,085 --> 00:08:11,185
<b>[ My goodness.
Only we can tell which one is hers. ]</b>

111
00:08:11,255 --> 00:08:13,920
<b>I doubt other people can tell
which one is hers.</b>

112
00:08:14,055 --> 00:08:15,880
<b>I think it's the one on the left.</b>

113
00:08:16,085 --> 00:08:17,250
<b>What?</b>

114

<b>who can tell us

00:10:08,435 --> 00:10:09,560
<b>Alright.</b>

129
00:10:11,275 --> 00:10:12,630
<b>I have bad news, ma'am.</b>

130

<b>Just a while ago,

<b>[ That must be the real one. ]</b>

<b>[ - My gosh.
- Goodness. ]</b>

137

<b>A fake outfit was on display here.</b>

157
00:12:25,575 --> 00:12:26,970
<b>[ Goodness. ]</b>

158
00:12:32,115 --> 00:12:33,815
<b>We will provide you with the details</b>

<b>Let's end it here today.</b>

161

<b>Louis, let's get to the car.</b>

162
00:12:48,365 --> 00:12:49,795
<b>Mr. Lim, what happened?</b>

163
00:12:49,865 --> 00:12:51,130
<b>Please give us a comment.</b>

164
00:12:51,965 --> 00:12:54,400
<b>Do you seriously believe that?</b>

165
00:12:57,875 --> 00:13:00,105
<b>They used to be</b>

166

<b>business partners only a few months ago.</b>

167
00:13:03,645 --> 00:13:05,440
<b>The biggest reason</b>

168
00:13:05,815 --> 00:13:08,915
<b>behind Bella and Ms. Jang's breakup</b>

169
00:13:08,985 --> 00:13:12,885
<b>was the dispute they had
as Ms. Jang pushed her</b>

170
00:13:12,955 --> 00:13:15,525
<b>to continue their joint project
with Louis.</b>

171
00:13:15,585 --> 00:13:18,190
<b>Are you saying that
Ms. Jang bought Chairman Louis off?</b>

172
00:13:18,295 --> 00:13:21,125
<b>That's something you must look into.</b>

173
00:13:21,195 --> 00:13:23,625
<b>Anyway, we didn't intend it,</b>

174
00:13:23,695 --> 00:13:26,330
<b>but we ended up being in the limelight.</b>

175
00:13:26,365 --> 00:13:28,735
<b>The bigger the buzz is,
the better marketing we get.</b>

176
00:13:28,805 --> 00:13:30,970
<b>How will you confront this accusation?</b>

177
00:13:31,005 --> 00:13:33,105
<b>If I confront every absurd accusation,</b>

178
00:13:33,175 --> 00:13:35,640
<b>I'll only be fueling the fire.</b>

179
00:13:35,645 --> 00:13:38,240
<b>That's probably what Ms. Jang</b>

180
00:13:38,445 --> 00:13:39,945
<b>was after.</b>

181
00:13:40,015 --> 00:13:41,845
<b>This is it for today's questions.</b>

<b>[ Let's go. ]</b>

<b>- Mr. Lim, one more question.
- A comment, please.</b>

184
00:13:47,455 --> 00:13:48,455
<b>- A question.
- Sir.</b>

185
00:13:48,525 --> 00:13:50,180
<b>- This is it.
- Hold on.</b>

186
00:13:54,825 --> 00:13:56,090
<b>Wait...</b>

187
00:13:56,795 --> 00:13:58,190
<b>Keep a straight face on.</b>

188
00:14:08,275 --> 00:14:11,540
<b>[ You must've been flustered.

189
00:14:11,675 --> 00:14:13,470
<b>[ It's just getting started. ]</b>

190
00:14:18,655 --> 00:14:21,850
<b>I'm sure Mr. Lim offered you
a very good deal.</b>

191
00:14:22,855 --> 00:14:24,050
<b>Yes, he did.</b>

192
00:14:24,525 --> 00:14:28,460
<b>He promised me a 10-year exclusive
contract with Belle Ombre.</b>

193
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:32,930
<b>It must have been hard
to turn down Mr. Lim's offer.</b>

194
00:14:32,965 --> 00:14:34,830
<b>A lot of thoughts crossed my mind
on my way there.</b>

195
00:14:35,065 --> 00:14:38,500
<b>But what I need is not Donghan.</b>

196
00:14:38,535 --> 00:14:40,400
<b>- It's Bella.
- Right.</b>

197
00:14:40,445 --> 00:14:42,840
<b>She needs to come see me this time.</b>

198
00:14:44,015 --> 00:14:45,610
<b>And about the contract, too.</b>

199
00:14:46,275 --> 00:14:49,585
<b>I want to renew it exclusively with Bella.</b>

200
00:14:49,645 --> 00:14:51,410
<b>Don't forget this, Madam Jang.</b>

201

<b>I'm a businessman.</b>

202
00:15:04,495 --> 00:15:07,205
<b>Louis will have
a follow-up interview tomorrow?</b>

203
00:15:07,265 --> 00:15:11,175
<b>Yes. And the girl who claims herself
to be Bella will</b>

<b>I see.</b>

206
00:15:15,505 --> 00:15:17,945
<b>As it's the day before

207
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:20,570

<b>[ I'm not sure how I should handle this. ]</b>

209

<b>Did you look into that girl who came
to the funeral with Jang Sun-young?</b>

210
00:15:26,285 --> 00:15:28,255
<b>Yes, as you expected,</b>

211
00:15:28,325 --> 00:15:31,095
<b>she's connected to Ms. Han and Mr. Kang.</b>

212

<b>Do you think she's real Bella?</b>

213
00:15:34,495 --> 00:15:38,260
<b>Is she the one who's claiming to be Bella?</b>

214
00:15:38,365 --> 00:15:40,460
<b>It looks like that girl has been living</b>

<b>in Seoha Village, Nonyang

218

<b>If what they're saying is true,</b>

253

<b>why would they need the interviews</b>

<b>and have the media involved?</b>

255

<b>Are they going to destroy our village

620
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:24,000
<b>We'll see how things progress.</b>

621
00:47:24,070 --> 00:47:25,810
<b>Progress?</b>

622
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:29,180
<b>You have to help us out.</b>

623
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:30,910
<b>Now that you're bringing it up,</b>

624
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:32,380
<b>when have I ever not helped you?</b>

625
00:47:32,450 --> 00:47:35,410
<b>I signed the MOU with Donghan Food,
brought the provincial governor,</b>

626
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:37,850
<b>and did everything I could to promote

<b>Yes, you're right.</b>

00:47:41,190 --> 00:47:43,290
<b>Since you've helped us a lot,</b>

630
00:47:45,830 --> 00:47:47,660
<b>A civil servant surely can't</b>

<b>Goodness.</b>

633
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:54,400
<b>I'm not the one going back on my words,</b>

<b>This interview was so difficult to get!</b>

<b>Apart from the project itself,</b>

<b>It's not over yet.</b>

695

<b>As you know,

696
00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:19,610

<b>This may be his last fight

698
00:51:24,610 --> 00:51:26,480
<b>Seems like fate is in Bella's hands.</b>

699
00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:28,380
<b>Bella can save both her company</b>

<b>It'll be all right, right?</b>

707
00:52:07,490 --> 00:52:08,450
<b>What is?</b>

708
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:10,220
<b>Say that Bella does the interview</b>

709
00:52:10,290 --> 00:52:12,520
<b>and takes a big blow on Mr. Lim.</b>

710
00:52:12,890 --> 00:52:13,990
<b>But if he tries</b>

711
00:52:14,060 --> 00:52:16,800
<b>to stay in power through lawsuits,</b>

712
00:52:16,930 --> 00:52:19,430
<b>then we'll never know
when this fight will end.</b>

713
00:52:20,230 --> 00:52:22,030
<b>Seoha Village could be gone</b>

714
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:24,140
<b>in the meantime.</b>

715
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:25,900
<b>We have no other choice.</b>

716
00:52:26,370 --> 00:52:29,370
<b>What's important right now is</b>

717
00:52:29,740 --> 00:52:32,580
<b>to stop Mr. Lim from becoming
the chairman of the company.</b>

718
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:42,390
<b>Mr. Lim.</b>

719
00:52:46,990 --> 00:52:48,990
<b>Yes, you're the head of Seoha Village.</b>

720
00:52:53,230 --> 00:52:54,800
<b>What brings you here?</b>

721
00:52:54,870 --> 00:52:56,940
<b>I heard that the gourmandism business
has been halted</b>

722
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,510
<b>and that you're working
on the clothing industrial complex again,</b>

723
00:52:59,570 --> 00:53:00,840
<b>which is what brings me here.</b>

724
00:53:00,910 --> 00:53:04,480
<b>Right, the clothing industrial complex.</b>

725
00:53:04,610 --> 00:53:06,910
<b>That all depends on Yu-jin.</b>

726
00:53:07,410 --> 00:53:08,580
<b>What?</b>

727
00:53:08,850 --> 00:53:10,120
<b>What are you talking about?</b>

728
00:53:10,180 --> 00:53:11,280
<b>Oh, my.</b>

729
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:14,690
<b>I'm guessing that you haven't heard yet.</b>

730
00:53:16,790 --> 00:53:20,630
<b>Yu-jin holds the village very close
to her heart.</b>

731
00:53:21,060 --> 00:53:25,130
<b>When I said that I'd be resuming
the clothing industrial complex project,</b>

732
00:53:26,170 --> 00:53:30,770
<b>she looked so sad as if she's going
to stop impersonating Bella.</b>

733
00:53:33,270 --> 00:53:35,510
<b>What did you say to her?</b>

734
00:53:40,750 --> 00:53:44,120
<b>"Is it Belle Ombre or Seoha Village?"</b>

735
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:47,590
<b>I told her to choose.</b>

736
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:53,990
<b>That was very kind of me,
considering that she's a swindler.</b>

737
00:53:58,330 --> 00:54:00,530
<b>How dare you call her a swindler?</b>

738
00:54:00,930 --> 00:54:02,570
<b>You think you can get away with this?</b>

739
00:54:11,310 --> 00:54:13,880
<b>I just helped her</b>

740
00:54:14,910 --> 00:54:17,450
<b>to get her head straight.</b>

741
00:54:27,930 --> 00:54:29,090
<b>Yu-jin...</b>

742
00:54:44,930 --> 00:54:48,460
<b>One of Bella's worst habits is</b>

743
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:53,270
<b>to disappear before the event
then appears before it starts.</b>

744
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:56,840
<b>If we wait, she'll definitely come.</b>

745
00:54:57,210 --> 00:54:58,370
<b>She'd better come.</b>

746

<b>This isn't just about Belle Ombre,</b>

747
