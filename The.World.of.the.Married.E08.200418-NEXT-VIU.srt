<b>Mom's going to kill me when she finds out.</b>

160
00:13:14,233 --> 00:13:16,773
<b>- Did you drop it somewhere? - No way.</b>

161
00:13:16,902 --> 00:13:19,442
<b>- Did you check your locker? - I looked everywhere.</b>

162
00:13:34,893 --> 00:13:36,123
<b>How was the gathering?</b>

163
00:13:36,893 --> 00:13:38,662
<b>- Was it fun? - Yes.</b>

164
00:13:39,093 --> 00:13:41,233
<b>I thought it'd be boring to hang out with old ladies,</b>

165
00:13:41,233 --> 00:13:42,603
<b>but it was unexpectedly fun.</b>

166
00:13:45,172 --> 00:13:46,932
<b>Mom was impressed with you.</b>

167
00:13:47,572 --> 00:13:48,773
<b>She told me to compliment you.</b>

168
00:13:48,773 --> 00:13:50,503
<b>It was nothing.</b>

169
00:13:56,883 --> 00:13:57,912
<b>Thank you.</b>

170
00:13:58,582 --> 00:14:00,912
<b>Thanks to you, I feel more confident.</b>

171
00:14:04,853 --> 00:14:06,093
<b>Are you going to the office?</b>

172
00:14:06,093 --> 00:14:08,263
<b>Yes. I won't work too late.</b>

173
00:14:13,932 --> 00:14:14,963
<b>It's not that...</b>

174
00:14:16,733 --> 00:14:18,202
<b>I don't like Joon Young.</b>

175
00:14:19,302 --> 00:14:22,843
<b>I need some time to get close to him.</b>

176
00:14:26,743 --> 00:14:27,843
<b>I know.</b>

177
00:14:29,442 --> 00:14:32,452
<b>Don't worry. I'll take care of him on my own.</b>

178
00:14:35,023 --> 00:14:36,652
<b>Let's invite him to dinner sometime.</b>

179
00:14:44,263 --> 00:14:46,133
<b>Thank you, Da Kyung.</b>

180
00:14:58,343 --> 00:15:00,513
<b>(Chairman Yeo)</b>

181
00:15:07,652 --> 00:15:10,822
<b>I heard you told the hospital you'd make a donation.</b>

182
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:12,593
<b>Is this true?</b>

183
00:15:13,523 --> 00:15:16,023
<b>I was going to tell you once it was confirmed.</b>

184
00:15:18,363 --> 00:15:20,932
<b>- I'm sorry. - Just because I gave you a title...</b>

185
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:23,763
<b>doesn't mean you have control over the company's money.</b>

186
00:15:25,233 --> 00:15:28,373
<b>So? Where are you going to get the money to donate?</b>

187
00:15:31,003 --> 00:15:33,412
<b>I was planning to discuss it with you, of course.</b>

188
00:15:37,682 --> 00:15:40,483
<b>If you won't give me your approval, I'll call it off.</b>

189
00:15:45,723 --> 00:15:47,253
<b>Are you sure you can straighten everything out?</b>

190
00:15:52,263 --> 00:15:53,692
<b>Do it properly if you're going to do it.</b>

191
00:15:59,233 --> 00:16:00,233
<b>Yes, sir.</b>

192
00:16:00,973 --> 00:16:02,343
<b>I'll do that.</b>

193
00:16:38,373 --> 00:16:39,373
<b>Hello.</b>

194
00:16:41,483 --> 00:16:43,542
<b>It wouldn't be fun...</b>

195
00:16:44,383 --> 00:16:45,552
<b>if you're breaking down already.</b>

196
00:16:51,753 --> 00:16:53,593
<b>It's not what it seems.</b>

197
00:16:53,593 --> 00:16:57,922
<b>There's something I'm thankful to you about.</b>

198
00:16:58,692 --> 00:16:59,733
<b>You know it too, don't you?</b>

199
00:17:01,162 --> 00:17:02,233
<b>Be careful.</b>

200
00:17:03,562 --> 00:17:05,372
<b>They're not the type to back down.</b>

201

<b>(Ji Sun Woo, you should leave this place!)</b>

202

00:19:14,963 --> 00:19:16,163
<b>Hello, Dr. Ji.</b>

204
00:19:16,963 --> 00:19:19,032
<b>You forgot to take the documents...</b>

205
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:20,403
<b>you were planning to review.</b>

206
00:19:20,903 --> 00:19:22,342
<b>Should I drop them off for you?</b>

207
00:19:23,342 --> 00:19:24,572
<b>Did I leave them?</b>

208
00:19:27,513 --> 00:19:28,513
<b>No.</b>

209
00:19:29,782 --> 00:19:30,882
<b>I'll go back.</b>

210

<b>(Family Love Hospital)</b>

<b>(Family Love Hospital)</b>

00:20:47,723 --> 00:20:49,923
<b>Have you seen Joon Young?</b>

<b>(Doctor Kim Yoon Ki)</b>

<b>(Doctor Kim Yoon Ki)</b>

217
00:21:30,416 --> 00:21:32,726
<b>Dr. Ji, isn't today your day off?</b>

218
00:21:35,095 --> 00:21:36,196
<b>Joon Young.</b>

219
00:21:37,355 --> 00:21:38,696
<b>What are you doing here?</b>

220
00:21:45,535 --> 00:21:46,835
<b>Why can't you answer me?</b>

221
00:21:48,236 --> 00:21:50,176
<b>What are you doing here without me?</b>

222
00:21:50,605 --> 00:21:52,006
<b>What about you? Why are you here?</b>

223
00:21:52,406 --> 00:21:54,406
<b>You even follow me now?</b>

224
00:21:56,476 --> 00:22:00,285
<b>Are you hiding something from me?</b>

225
00:22:00,285 --> 00:22:02,516
<b>Dr. Ji, please calm down.</b>

226
00:22:02,686 --> 00:22:05,085
<b>Dr. Kim, you tell me. What's going on?</b>

227
00:22:05,785 --> 00:22:07,956
<b>Is there something wrong with Joon Young?</b>

228
00:22:07,956 --> 00:22:09,926
<b>- Will you please stop? - He's a minor.</b>

229
00:22:09,926 --> 00:22:11,766
<b>Why are you seeing him without a guardian?</b>

230
00:22:11,766 --> 00:22:13,496
<b>Please just stop!</b>

231
00:22:15,236 --> 00:22:17,696
<b>I feel suffocated every time you act like this.</b>

232
00:22:18,236 --> 00:22:19,365
<b>Do you know that?</b>

233
00:22:23,035 --> 00:22:24,135
<b>Joon Young!</b>

234
00:22:25,176 --> 00:22:26,906
<b>What's wrong? What's going on?</b>

235
00:22:27,545 --> 00:22:29,016
<b>- Wait. - Let me go.</b>

236
00:22:29,746 --> 00:22:31,986
<b>You need to give him some space.</b>

237
00:22:34,016 --> 00:22:36,216
<b>Even if you go after him, you won't be able to do anything.</b>

238
00:22:36,216 --> 00:22:38,085
<b>Why didn't you tell me anything?</b>

239
00:22:40,285 --> 00:22:42,055
<b>If you knew about this,</b>

240
00:22:43,295 --> 00:22:45,365
<b>Joon Young wouldn't have come to get counseling.</b>

241
00:22:56,506 --> 00:22:57,605
<b>Joon Young.</b>

242
00:22:59,176 --> 00:23:00,406
<b>Open the door.</b>

243
00:23:04,976 --> 00:23:06,345
<b>Come out and eat.</b>

244
00:23:07,585 --> 00:23:09,315
<b>You need to eat.</b>

245
00:23:12,385 --> 00:23:15,055
<b>Should I bring something to your room instead?</b>

246
00:23:19,625 --> 00:23:23,135
<b>Okay, fine. I'll be in my room.</b>

247
00:23:25,166 --> 00:23:26,406
<b>Let me know if you're hungry.</b>

248
00:24:15,815 --> 00:24:19,456
<b>(Dad)</b>

249
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:05,936
<b>I'm going to have dinner at Dad's place tomorrow.</b>

250
00:25:11,206 --> 00:25:13,646
<b>He's been coming to me for about six months.</b>

251
00:25:15,516 --> 00:25:17,545
<b>He feels guilty about the divorce.</b>

252
00:25:17,545 --> 00:25:19,146
<b>He thinks it happened because of him.</b>

253
00:25:21,085 --> 00:25:22,216
<b>That's nonsense.</b>

254
00:25:24,385 --> 00:25:27,456
<b>He knows we got a divorce because of what his dad did.</b>

255
00:25:28,656 --> 00:25:30,525
<b>Why would he blame himself?</b>

256
00:25:31,355 --> 00:25:35,396
<b>Kids who have divorced parents tend to easily blame themselves.</b>

257
00:25:35,396 --> 00:25:36,666
<b>But with Joon Young,</b>

258
00:25:37,936 --> 00:25:39,436
<b>it's a little different.</b>

259
00:25:42,676 --> 00:25:46,575
<b>He found the memory card that he threw away in your room.</b>

260
00:25:46,676 --> 00:25:50,176
<b>He told me it had a recording of your ex-husband's affair.</b>

261
00:25:54,585 --> 00:25:58,926
<b>He thinks that's how you found out that your ex-husband was cheating.</b>

262
00:26:04,726 --> 00:26:05,825
<b>What should I do?</b>

263
00:26:09,295 --> 00:26:10,795
<b>What do I need to do?</b>

264
00:26:13,206 --> 00:26:15,335
<b>I told him numerous times that it wasn't his fault.</b>

265
00:26:15,335 --> 00:26:16,835
<b>And he's gotten a lot better.</b>

266
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:23,446
<b>I had no idea what was going on inside his head...</b>

267
00:26:25,246 --> 00:26:27,345
<b>because I was too busy taking care of myself.</b>

268
00:26:33,385 --> 00:26:34,585
<b>It's all my fault.</b>

269
00:26:36,396 --> 00:26:38,996
<b>I should've kept it out of his sight.</b>

270
00:26:39,996 --> 00:26:42,466
<b>Trust him and just wait. I'm sure he'll overcome it.</b>

271
00:26:43,436 --> 00:26:45,095
<b>He's very sensitive and smart.</b>

272
00:26:51,936 --> 00:26:55,176
<b>You should let him meet his dad for the time being.</b>

273
00:26:55,176 --> 00:26:57,446
<b>It'll help him overcome the emptiness that he felt.</b>

274
00:26:59,045 --> 00:27:00,716
<b>But of course, that's going to be hard for you.</b>

275
00:27:29,916 --> 00:27:31,716
<b>Should we spend Christmas in Jeju Island?</b>

276
00:27:35,186 --> 00:27:37,055
<b>It's because you want to play golf, isn't it?</b>

277
00:27:38,926 --> 00:27:40,525
<b>If you think it'll be too cold, we can do something else.</b>

278
00:27:42,795 --> 00:27:44,196
<b>Golf sounds nice.</b>

279
00:27:50,865 --> 00:27:51,966
<b>Okay.</b>

280
00:27:54,535 --> 00:27:55,575
<b>I'll reserve a hotel.</b>

281
00:28:00,375 --> 00:28:03,916
<b>Since we're on that subject, let's get you some new golf clothes.</b>

282
00:28:04,275 --> 00:28:05,946
<b>Yours are all out of trend.</b>

283
00:28:06,516 --> 00:28:07,646
<b>That'd be nice.</b>

284
00:28:27,166 --> 00:28:28,365
<b>Did you enjoy your meal?</b>

285
00:28:29,335 --> 00:28:30,936
<b>My wife liked it very much.</b>

286
00:28:40,246 --> 00:28:41,345
<b>Your sign, please.</b>

287
00:28:49,295 --> 00:28:51,996
<b>- Would you like a receipt? - Yes.</b>

288
00:29:06,406 --> 00:29:07,476
<b>Thank you, sir.</b>

289
00:29:14,885 --> 00:29:16,486
<b>- Are you done? - Yes.</b>

290
00:29:17,486 --> 00:29:19,256
<b>- Let's go. - We hope to see you again.</b>

291
00:29:19,256 --> 00:29:20,325
<b>Bye.</b>

292
00:29:23,355 --> 00:29:24,456
<b>It was nice, wasn't it?</b>

293
00:29:31,535 --> 00:29:33,105
<b>Are you listening to me, honey?</b>

294
00:29:33,835 --> 00:29:36,006
<b>I'm sorry. What were you saying?</b>

295
00:29:36,506 --> 00:29:40,006
<b>I think someone's spying on Joon Young's house.</b>

296
00:29:40,006 --> 00:29:41,775
<b>Stop caring about them.</b>

297
00:29:42,615 --> 00:29:44,275
<b>The ones who had an affair...</b>

298
00:29:44,275 --> 00:29:45,946
<b>have a kid together now and are happily married.</b>

299
00:29:46,115 --> 00:29:50,156
<b>But Sun Woo's still all alone. This world is so unfair.</b>

300
00:29:50,355 --> 00:29:54,285
<b>And I'm kind of worried that something might happen.</b>

301
00:29:55,896 --> 00:29:57,426
<b>I'm more worried about you.</b>

302
00:29:58,625 --> 00:30:01,795
<b>Make sure you keep the door locked when you're home alone.</b>

303
00:30:03,396 --> 00:30:05,605
<b>Okay, I'll make sure.</b>

304
00:30:11,335 --> 00:30:15,045
<b>Have you thought about it, sir?</b>

305
00:30:16,216 --> 00:30:20,686
<b>You know it's not something I can decide so easily.</b>

306
00:30:21,516 --> 00:30:26,025
<b>You should start off by telling the chairperson.</b>

307
00:30:28,525 --> 00:30:32,156
<b>Have you already decided on the next associate director?</b>

308
00:30:36,496 --> 00:30:39,006
<b>Make sure Dr. Ji doesn't hear about this.</b>

309
00:30:43,506 --> 00:30:44,775
<b>Of course.</b>

310
00:30:51,045 --> 00:30:52,176
<b>Dr. Ji.</b>

311
00:31:00,226 --> 00:31:01,325
<b>Enjoy your coffee.</b>

312
00:31:08,226 --> 00:31:09,535
<b>Is Joon Young okay?</b>

313
00:31:11,535 --> 00:31:12,635
<b>Yes.</b>

314
00:31:14,605 --> 00:31:17,906
<b>Let me know if you need my help.</b>

315
00:31:19,305 --> 00:31:20,375
<b>Why would you offer to help?</b>

316
00:31:22,315 --> 00:31:25,275
<b>- Well, I just meant... - What?</b>

317
00:31:26,646 --> 00:31:28,315
<b>How are you going to help?</b>

318
00:31:33,686 --> 00:31:34,686
<b>Never mind.</b>

319
00:31:35,456 --> 00:31:36,496
<b>Forget I mentioned it.</b>

320
00:31:54,676 --> 00:31:57,875
<b>Dr. Sul, you came to the wrong person.</b>

321
00:31:58,986 --> 00:32:01,385
<b>The chairperson of Love Hospital and I...</b>

322
00:32:01,516 --> 00:32:03,456
<b>just chit chat about personal things.</b>

323
00:32:04,186 --> 00:32:06,756
<b>We don't discuss important matters.</b>

324
00:32:07,186 --> 00:32:10,855
<b>Chairman Choi was our hospital's benefactor for so many years.</b>

325
00:32:11,496 --> 00:32:14,025
<b>Why are you being so modest?</b>

326
00:32:14,295 --> 00:32:16,865
<b>Did you meet with the chairperson?</b>

327
00:32:18,035 --> 00:32:19,065
<b>Well...</b>

328
00:32:19,766 --> 00:32:21,605
<b>the chairperson didn't seem to know at all.</b>

329
00:32:25,105 --> 00:32:28,275
<b>My husband is very cautious about everything.</b>

330
00:32:29,646 --> 00:32:31,375
<b>I guess he hasn't reported it yet.</b>

331
00:32:32,986 --> 00:32:34,246
<b>Don't make me laugh.</b>

332
00:32:34,585 --> 00:32:38,285
<b>No one is as calculating as Dr. Kong.</b>

333
00:32:39,686 --> 00:32:42,696
<b>Dr. Ji Sun Woo is good at her job.</b>

334
00:32:42,956 --> 00:32:45,295
<b>I hear everyone knows she has the most patients...</b>

335
00:32:45,295 --> 00:32:46,795
<b>among all the doctors there.</b>

336
00:32:50,565 --> 00:32:51,565
<b>Thank you.</b>

337
00:32:56,275 --> 00:32:57,375
<b>What do I do?</b>

338
00:33:00,575 --> 00:33:01,845
<b>I'll start. Chime in.</b>

339
00:33:02,045 --> 00:33:03,476
<b>I'll follow your lead.</b>

340
00:33:05,815 --> 00:33:08,485
<b>I hear once TO Pictures finishes building their set,</b>

341
00:33:08,916 --> 00:33:13,086
<b>I hear more than 100 staff members will be coming for a single shoot.</b>

342
00:33:13,555 --> 00:33:15,425
<b>I know he may be my friend,</b>

343
00:33:15,425 --> 00:33:17,356
<b>but I wonder when he became such a big shot.</b>

344
00:33:17,526 --> 00:33:19,465
<b>I'm still in awe.</b>

345
00:33:19,595 --> 00:33:22,066
<b>Everyone thought he was worthless at first.</b>

346
00:33:22,436 --> 00:33:24,635
<b>Who knew he was a winning lottery ticket yet to be scratched?</b>

347
00:33:24,635 --> 00:33:25,936
<b>My point exactly.</b>

348
00:33:25,936 --> 00:33:28,365
<b>We'll have to wait and see.</b>

349
00:33:28,905 --> 00:33:30,376
<b>He made all that money...</b>

350
00:33:30,376 --> 00:33:31,436
<b>but...</b>

351
00:33:32,345 --> 00:33:35,075
<b>he's using it all to chase after his ex-wife.</b>

352
00:33:36,376 --> 00:33:38,345
<b>I don't think he's well inside.</b>

353
00:33:39,485 --> 00:33:42,016
<b>I really doubt that.</b>

354
00:33:42,385 --> 00:33:45,215
<b>Tae Oh is very pure at heart.</b>

355
00:33:45,385 --> 00:33:49,296
<b>He just feels guilty toward his father-in-law.</b>

356
00:33:49,296 --> 00:33:50,825
<b>That's why he's doing this.</b>

357
00:33:50,825 --> 00:33:52,055
<b>Of course.</b>

358
00:33:52,726 --> 00:33:55,496
<b>How could he donate money to his ex-wife's hospital?</b>

359
00:33:55,496 --> 00:33:57,836
<b>People may get the wrong idea.</b>

360
00:33:57,836 --> 00:34:01,436
<b>Of course, I feel bad for Dr. Ji Sun Woo.</b>

361
00:34:01,436 --> 00:34:03,476
<b>She worked so hard as the face of the hospital.</b>

362
00:34:03,776 --> 00:34:05,905
<b>I feel like she's being replaced because of her family matters.</b>

363
00:34:07,276 --> 00:34:09,215
<b>But what can you do?</b>

364
00:34:09,215 --> 00:34:11,816
<b>I never knew you were...</b>

365
00:34:13,316 --> 00:34:15,215
<b>so ambitious, Dr. Sul.</b>

366
00:34:16,785 --> 00:34:18,016
<b>I'm done now.</b>

367
00:34:20,555 --> 00:34:22,385
<b>Why don't you continue?</b>

368
00:34:22,896 --> 00:34:25,965
<b>No. I'm going to leave first.</b>

369
00:34:30,836 --> 00:34:31,865
<b>It's okay.</b>

370
00:34:32,266 --> 00:34:33,666
<b>Don't worry, and wait.</b>

371
00:34:34,905 --> 00:34:38,575
<b>My husband said he'll weigh the pros and cons...</b>

372
00:34:39,175 --> 00:34:40,546
<b>between the donation and Dr. Ji.</b>

373
00:34:42,746 --> 00:34:45,115
<b>Thank you, ma'am.</b>

374
00:35:33,626 --> 00:35:34,666
<b>Get in.</b>

375
00:35:49,575 --> 00:35:50,615
<b>Let's go.</b>

376
00:36:42,735 --> 00:36:44,595
<b>Jenny must like her big brother.</b>

377
00:36:47,135 --> 00:36:49,535
<b>She can't seem to talk yet.</b>

378
00:36:49,976 --> 00:36:52,675
<b>She doesn't eat if there's someone she doesn't like.</b>

379
00:36:53,345 --> 00:36:55,345
<b>See? She's eating so well.</b>

380
00:37:01,285 --> 00:37:04,055
<b>Honey, would you go get Jenny's diaper and wipes?</b>

381
00:37:05,785 --> 00:37:06,856
<b>Okay.</b>

382
00:37:16,166 --> 00:37:17,666
<b>You're still uncomfortable with me, right?</b>

383
00:37:22,575 --> 00:37:23,606
<b>The truth is,</b>

384
00:37:24,876 --> 00:37:26,175
<b>I feel the same.</b>

385
00:37:30,246 --> 00:37:33,945
<b>But I'd like us to be comfortable with each other now.</b>

386
00:37:35,845 --> 00:37:38,555
<b>I'm very sorry about what happened.</b>

387
00:37:40,086 --> 00:37:42,726
<b>But I love your dad,</b>

388
00:37:44,195 --> 00:37:45,925
<b>and your dad cares a lot for you.</b>

389
00:37:48,365 --> 00:37:50,635
<b>I'd like you to do well and be comfortable.</b>

390
00:37:51,796 --> 00:37:55,135
<b>You need to be happy for your dad to be happy.</b>

391
00:38:37,246 --> 00:38:39,945
<b>Joon Young lost love through the divorce as well.</b>

392
00:38:40,385 --> 00:38:42,246
<b>Please understand his conflicting feelings...</b>

393
00:38:42,246 --> 00:38:44,055
<b>of missing his dad while hating him at the same time.</b>

394
00:38:59,865 --> 00:39:00,965
<b>We're in trouble.</b>

395
00:39:01,566 --> 00:39:04,135
<b>Jenny will end up liking her brother more than me at this rate.</b>

396
00:39:06,206 --> 00:39:07,945
<b>- Have some fruit, Joon Young. - Okay.</b>

397
00:39:17,456 --> 00:39:18,456
<b>Here.</b>

398
00:39:19,785 --> 00:39:21,086
<b>Have a grape.</b>

399
00:39:26,595 --> 00:39:28,396
<b>We should get ready to go.</b>

400
00:39:30,035 --> 00:39:32,235
<b>Eat. I'll get the keys.</b>

401
00:39:33,436 --> 00:39:34,905
<b>Do you want to stay for the night?</b>

402
00:39:35,635 --> 00:39:37,106
<b>It's late.</b>

403
00:39:39,005 --> 00:39:41,175
<b>Your dad can drive you to school in the morning.</b>

404
00:39:42,005 --> 00:39:43,115
<b>No?</b>

405
00:39:45,115 --> 00:39:47,686
<b>But there's nowhere for him to sleep.</b>

406
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:00,595
<b>When did you do this?</b>

407
00:40:01,965 --> 00:40:04,035
<b>What do you think? Do you like your room?</b>

408
00:41:05,226 --> 00:41:06,396
<b>How have you been?</b>

409
00:41:06,396 --> 00:41:07,626
<b>(How have you been?)</b>

410
00:41:07,626 --> 00:41:10,566
<b>I thought of you and thought I'd say hi.</b>

411
00:42:05,586 --> 00:42:07,425
<b>(Kim Yoon Ki)</b>

412
00:42:12,425 --> 00:42:13,425
<b>(Kim Yoon Ki)</b>

413
00:42:16,996 --> 00:42:19,666
<b>Help! Help!</b>

414
00:42:20,905 --> 00:42:23,135
<b>Dr. Ji.</b>

415
00:42:25,135 --> 00:42:26,246
<b>Dr. Ji.</b>

416
00:42:28,746 --> 00:42:29,816
<b>Dr. Ji?</b>

417
00:43:03,816 --> 00:43:06,686
<b>Who... Who are you?</b>

418
00:44:48,445 --> 00:44:50,456
<b>(Kim Yoon Ki)</b>

419
00:44:55,785 --> 00:44:56,856
<b>This is the police.</b>

420
00:44:58,555 --> 00:44:59,865
<b>Please open the door.</b>

421
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:16,845
<b>Did you get to see his face?</b>

422
00:45:19,646 --> 00:45:22,046
<b>No. I couldn't see his face.</b>

423
00:45:34,695 --> 00:45:35,865
<b>Dr. Ji?</b>

424
00:45:40,535 --> 00:45:41,666
<b>What happened?</b>

425
00:45:42,035 --> 00:45:43,206
<b>Are you badly hurt?</b>

426
00:45:51,516 --> 00:45:52,876
<b>Let's get you treated first.</b>

427
00:45:54,046 --> 00:45:55,186
<b>Where's your first aid kit?</b>

428
00:46:01,755 --> 00:46:02,885
<b>I'm okay.</b>

429
00:46:05,255 --> 00:46:07,925
<b>Are you her guardian?</b>

430
00:46:08,266 --> 00:46:09,695
<b>Yes, we're colleagues from the same hospital.</b>

431
00:46:09,996 --> 00:46:12,066
<b>Could I ask you a few questions?</b>

432
00:46:14,365 --> 00:46:15,535
<b>Just a minute.</b>

433
00:46:31,785 --> 00:46:33,016
<b>(Son)</b>

434
00:46:44,496 --> 00:46:45,666
<b>Amazing.</b>

435
00:46:53,805 --> 00:46:54,876
<b>What's wrong?</b>

436
00:46:56,715 --> 00:46:58,075
<b>Is it because Mom didn't pick up?</b>

437
00:47:00,816 --> 00:47:02,246
<b>She must be sleeping already.</b>

438
00:47:03,356 --> 00:47:04,755
<b>She doesn't go to bed this early.</b>

439
00:47:05,985 --> 00:47:07,785
<b>She usually has trouble sleeping.</b>

440
00:47:15,166 --> 00:47:16,666
<b>(Mom)</b>

441
00:47:18,266 --> 00:47:19,396
<b>Mom?</b>

442
00:47:20,066 --> 00:47:21,365
<b>Yes, Joon Young.</b>

443
00:47:23,476 --> 00:47:25,476
<b>I missed your call because I was in the shower.</b>

444
00:47:26,805 --> 00:47:27,876
<b>What about dinner?</b>

445
00:47:29,246 --> 00:47:30,445
<b>Did you enjoy it?</b>

446
00:47:32,675 --> 00:47:33,785
<b>Yes.</b>

447
00:47:35,046 --> 00:47:36,215
<b>By the way,</b>

448
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:38,655
<b>can I sleep over at Dad's?</b>

449
00:47:44,825 --> 00:47:45,956
<b>Do you want to do that?</b>

450
00:47:51,896 --> 00:47:52,996
<b>That's a good idea.</b>

451
00:47:54,606 --> 00:47:56,876
<b>Sure. You can sleep over.</b>

452
00:47:57,106 --> 00:47:58,305
<b>Will you be okay alone?</b>

453
00:47:58,635 --> 00:48:01,106
<b>Yes, of course, I'm fine.</b>

454
00:48:06,445 --> 00:48:07,816
<b>Sleep at Dad's,</b>

455
00:48:08,416 --> 00:48:10,686
<b>and make sure you're not late for school tomorrow.</b>

456
00:48:11,885 --> 00:48:13,055
<b>Okay.</b>

457
00:48:14,325 --> 00:48:15,425
<b>Good night.</b>

458
00:48:29,066 --> 00:48:30,106
<b>What is it?</b>

459
00:48:31,436 --> 00:48:32,635
<b>Did Mom say no?</b>

460
00:48:34,305 --> 00:48:37,416
<b>No. She said it's a good idea.</b>

461
00:48:38,945 --> 00:48:40,186
<b>She told me to sleep here.</b>

462
00:48:40,246 --> 00:48:41,416
<b>That's great.</b>

463
00:48:42,146 --> 00:48:43,316
<b>Do you want to play one more round?</b>

464
00:48:57,595 --> 00:48:59,166
<b>They'll question you as a testifier tomorrow.</b>

465
00:48:59,666 --> 00:49:00,766
<b>I'll come with you.</b>

466
00:49:01,905 --> 00:49:02,965
<b>Thank you.</b>

467
00:49:04,505 --> 00:49:07,106
<b>I think he ran into the woman who lives across from you while fleeing.</b>

468
00:49:08,046 --> 00:49:10,046
<b>She's the one who reported it to the police too.</b>

469

<b>The person you have reached is not available.</b>

<b>(Hubby)</b>

<b>Have this.</b>

472

01:06:08,962 --> 01:06:10,121
<b>I said to go!</b>

629
01:06:39,322 --> 01:06:41,862
<b>- This one goes here. - It does?</b>

630
01:06:42,221 --> 01:06:44,261
<b>- And this... - Okay.</b>

631
01:06:44,261 --> 01:06:45,331
<b>And this...</b>

632
01:06:45,331 --> 01:06:47,492
<b>- It goes next to that? - Yes.</b>

633
01:06:47,492 --> 01:06:50,032
<b>- I think Mommy's home. - Okay.</b>

634
01:06:54,442 --> 01:06:55,671
<b>Why are you home so late?</b>

635
01:07:00,982 --> 01:07:03,381
<b>What's wrong with her? Do you think she fought with Tae Oh?</b>

636
01:07:21,631 --> 01:07:22,702
<b>Be careful.</b>

637
01:07:24,501 --> 01:07:27,072
<b>There's no rule that says you won't end up like me.</b>

638
01:08:14,181 --> 01:08:15,251
<b>Come in.</b>

639
01:08:26,532 --> 01:08:27,591
<b>What are you doing?</b>

640
01:08:28,931 --> 01:08:31,532
<b>I think our team won this bet.</b>

641
01:08:31,602 --> 01:08:33,232
<b>You should pay it all, Mom.</b>

642
01:08:33,331 --> 01:08:36,541
<b>Wait and see. "It ain't over till it's over."</b>

643
01:08:39,671 --> 01:08:40,742
<b>Pull!</b>

644
01:08:44,312 --> 01:08:45,452
<b>Yes!</b>

645
01:08:47,881 --> 01:08:49,022
<b>Nice.</b>

646
01:08:53,852 --> 01:08:55,062
<b>- Bravo. - High five.</b>

647
01:08:55,062 --> 01:08:57,291
<b>- Great job. - Yes.</b>

648
01:10:18,772 --> 01:10:20,242
<b>You seem to be enjoying yourselves.</b>

649
01:10:22,412 --> 01:10:24,381
<b>I'd like to join the women's association too.</b>

650
01:10:26,751 --> 01:10:28,022
<b>How do I join?</b>

651
01:10:35,721 --> 01:10:38,631
<b>As a rule, you need the members' consent.</b>

652
01:10:40,192 --> 01:10:41,232
<b>I doubt you'll get it.</b>

653
01:10:41,461 --> 01:10:42,862
<b>The consent of the members?</b>

654
01:10:45,501 --> 01:10:47,131
<b>Will I get in if I can get the vote of the majority?</b>

655
01:10:47,131 --> 01:10:48,202
<b>That's...</b>

656
01:10:50,772 --> 01:10:52,011
<b>Technically yes, but...</b>

657
01:10:52,011 --> 01:10:53,541
<b>I suggest you leave...</b>

658
01:10:54,812 --> 01:10:56,711
<b>before you get humiliated.</b>

659
01:10:58,112 --> 01:10:59,112
<b>No one here...</b>

660
01:10:59,952 --> 01:11:02,721
<b>would welcome you to join.</b>

661
01:11:06,192 --> 01:11:07,791
<b>Then let's not waste any time.</b>

662
01:11:09,662 --> 01:11:10,921
<b>Let's check right now.</b>

663
01:11:15,301 --> 01:11:16,402
<b>Okay, then.</b>

664
01:11:16,801 --> 01:11:17,801
<b>All right.</b>

665
01:11:18,402 --> 01:11:22,372
<b>Who agrees on having Dr. Ji join our association?</b>

666
01:11:23,341 --> 01:11:24,572
<b>Raise your hands.</b>

667
01:11:42,591 --> 01:11:43,662
<b>I vote yes.</b>

668
01:11:45,862 --> 01:11:46,961
<b>Me too.</b>

669
01:11:57,942 --> 01:11:59,812
<b>It would put me in a difficult position...</b>

670
01:12:00,272 --> 01:12:02,112
<b>to say no to our associate director.</b>

671
01:12:11,122 --> 01:12:13,992
<b>Unfortunately, you didn't get the majority.</b>

672
01:12:29,041 --> 01:12:30,202
<b>I'll vote in favor too.</b>

673
01:12:35,112 --> 01:12:36,141
<b>Da Kyung.</b>

674
01:12:46,921 --> 01:12:47,921
<b>Thank you.</b>

675

<b>(A World of Married Couple)</b>

676
01:13:26,992 --> 01:13:29,631
<b>You want to join the Gosan Women's Association?</b>

677
01:13:29,631 --> 01:13:30,862
<b>What's your goal?</b>

678
01:13:31,032 --> 01:13:33,501
<b>I'll just call it a warning I'm sending to Lee Tae Oh.</b>

679
01:13:33,732 --> 01:13:35,442
<b>How can you leave the kid at home alone?</b>

680
01:13:35,702 --> 01:13:37,902
<b>Don't tell me you're in a serious relationship with him.</b>

681
01:13:38,011 --> 01:13:41,341
<b>That's enough. She's no longer your wife.</b>

682
01:13:41,541 --> 01:13:44,812
<b>That psychiatrist from Seoul seems to have...</b>

683
01:13:45,112 --> 01:13:46,881
<b>a good reputation.</b>

684
01:13:46,881 --> 01:13:49,251
<b>Do you think I'm the only one who wanted...</b>

685
01:13:49,551 --> 01:13:51,322
<b>to get rid of you?</b>

686
01:13:51,591 --> 01:13:52,692
<b>Are you scared...</b>

687
01:13:52,692 --> 01:13:55,022
<b>I'll tell what you did to me?</b>

688
01:13:55,322 --> 01:13:57,992
<b>How much do you trust your husband?</b>

689
01:13:58,431 --> 01:13:59,461
<b>Watch your mouth.</b>

690
01:13:59,931 --> 01:14:02,461
<b>Don't drag Da Kyung into our problem.</b>
