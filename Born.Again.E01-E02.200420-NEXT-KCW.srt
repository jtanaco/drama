<b>I told him his blood type was O,</b>

687
01:03:22,436 --> 01:03:26,264
<b>and he believed the kid was born

<b>He stripped him naked, tied him up,</b>

689
01:03:31,335 --> 01:03:33,037
<b>and beat him for hours.</b>

690

<b>Did you deceive him?</b>

692
01:03:44,873 --> 01:03:46,417
<b>We would become happy...</b>

693
01:03:47,049 --> 01:03:50,272
<b>if it disappeared.

695
01:03:55,014 --> 01:03:56,527
<b>It wouldn't die
