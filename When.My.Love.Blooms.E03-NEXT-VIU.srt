<b>I beg of you, ma'am.</b>

2
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:03,870
<b>Please reconsider it.</b>

3
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:06,070
<b>If the reason you're trying to hold...</b>

4
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:09,600
<b>the committee is because it's your son...</b>

5
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:12,810
<b>Please take it out on me.</b>

6
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:17,580
<b>It's my fault for raising him poorly.</b>

7
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:19,580
<b>You can take it out on me...</b>

8
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:21,720
<b>however you like.</b>

9
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,850
<b>Then let's see what you can do...</b>

10
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:26,220
<b>to relieve my anger.</b>

11
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,660
<b>Please, ma'am.</b>

12
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:34,130
<b>Forgive him...</b>

13

<b>Please get up.</b>

15

<b>What do you think you're doing?</b>

16
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:48,010
<b>Get up, Yoon Ji Su!</b>

17
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:13,830
<b>Explain what's going on.</b>

18
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,100
<b>What's going on?</b>

19
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:19,440
<b>- Ms. Jang. - Take Ms. Yoon...</b>

20

<b>and excuse us.</b>

21
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,310
<b>Sure.</b>

22
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:39,690
<b>I told you not to make this an issue.</b>

23
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:42,000
<b>You talked about a young boy's future...</b>

24
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,300
<b>and acted as if you were so righteous.</b>

25
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:46,500
<b>Was it about a woman?</b>

26
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,040
<b>Why did you call her name...</b>

27
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,300
<b>and act so besotted?</b>

28
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:51,710
<b>She's a university friend.</b>

29
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,910
<b>Your first love?</b>

30
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:57,410
<b>Like the film "Love Letter"?</b>

31
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:03,450
<b>I didn't want to turn the kids' problem into ours,</b>

32
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:05,350
<b>but you just won't listen.</b>

33
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:06,850
<b>What do you mean?</b>

34
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:08,920
<b>If you don't cancel the committee,</b>

35

<b>that Se Hwi.</b>

36

<b>The guy called Se Hwi will never get to model again.</b>

37

<b>He has nothing to do with this.</b>

38

<b>He has something to do with you.</b>

39
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:24,010
<b>You'll ruin someone's bright future over something like this?</b>

40
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:25,270
<b>I'd like to say...</b>

41
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,710
<b>the exact same thing to your face.</b>

42
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:36,250
<b>Do you know how much they donated to us?</b>

43
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:39,250
<b>If Jun Seo transfers to another school,</b>

44
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:42,520
<b>we'll have to stop working on the new gymnasium.</b>

45
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,490
<b>And we'll have to fire 4 or 5 teachers too.</b>

46
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:48,560
<b>- Did it have to be Jun Seo... - I apologize.</b>

47
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,530
<b>But I feel that...</b>

48
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:54,470
<b>my Young Min must've felt lonely.</b>

49
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,010
<b>This school's in the middle of nowhere,</b>

50
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:01,110
<b>so everyone feels lonely and wants to go home.</b>

51
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,080
<b>Do all lonely kids resort to violence?</b>

52
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:13,850
<b>What about your wife?</b>

53
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:17,020
<b>The School Violence Committee will not meet.</b>

54
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,460
<b>Did your wife agree...</b>

55
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:22,530
<b>If you go against me again, my son will change schools.</b>

56
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,790
<b>I'll drop you off on the way.</b>

57

<b>No, thanks.</b>

58

<b>We gave you a tough time.</b>

59
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:31,930
<b>You did.</b>

60
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:33,900
<b>It hurts.</b>

61
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:38,410
<b>My wrist hurts, and so do my knees.</b>

62
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:42,310
<b>Get in. A car ride is better when your joints hurt.</b>

63
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:44,980
<b>No, it's not my joints that hurt.</b>

64
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:49,180
<b>I'm not that frail yet.</b>

65
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,720
<b>I know.</b>

66
00:06:58,620 --> 00:06:59,850
<b>My gosh.</b>

67
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:30,620
<b>Drop me off at the station. I can manage from there.</b>

68
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:32,320
<b>I'll drop you off at Seoul Station.</b>

69
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:35,360
<b>No. At the train station here.</b>

70
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:37,490
<b>You can't buy shoes here.</b>

71
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:38,630
<b>I can walk.</b>

72
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:42,430
<b>I wouldn't care if I hadn't seen,</b>

73
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:44,930
<b>but I did and I can't let you walk in that state.</b>

74
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:47,370
<b>You're not a starving kid.</b>

75

<b>What grown-up wears boots with a broken heel?</b>

76
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:53,610
<b>Are you okay?</b>

77
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:56,840
<b>- About what? - Your wife.</b>

78
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:00,010
<b>Are you okay?</b>

79
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,880
<b>You bowed deeply twice,</b>

80
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:05,020
<b>and today you even went on your knees.</b>

81
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:08,720
<b>I can do that a hundred or a thousand times.</b>

82
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,560
<b>If only to stop my son from crying.</b>

83
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,530
<b>To me, that is love.</b>

84
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:19,800
<b>Not making someone cry.</b>

85
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,640
<b>So I understand your wife too.</b>

86

<b>We protect our love in different ways.</b>

87
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:31,410
<b>I'll say this just in case.</b>

88
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,250
<b>I didn't cancel the committee just for you.</b>

89
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,790
<b>He still denies it,</b>

90
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:41,390
<b>but I think my son bullied yours.</b>

91
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,730
<b>In elementary school, he was a ringleader...</b>

92
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:47,730
<b>and got into trouble for bullying other kids.</b>

93
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:50,000
<b>His mom's indifferent,</b>

94
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:53,000
<b>and his grandfather's always on his side,</b>

95
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,700
<b>so he didn't fear anything.</b>

96
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,110
<b>I'm ashamed to say this,</b>

97
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:00,170
<b>but I'll talk to Jun Seo.</b>

98
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:02,580
<b>You should talk to Young Min.</b>

<b>(When My Love Blooms)</b>

100
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,760
<b>I'll take you home. Your boots...</b>

101
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,770
<b>It's a minute if I run.</b>

102
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,980
<b>I might have shoes in the trunk. Wait.</b>

103
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:36,410
<b>It's really okay.</b>

104
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:45,520
<b>I'll take these.</b>

105
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:56,860
<b>These are for men, so they'll be big.</b>

106
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,670
<b>Still, they'll be better than that.</b>

107
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:01,700
<b>It's really okay. It's a hassle to return them.</b>

108
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:02,900
<b>You don't have to return them.</b>

109
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:05,540
<b>Wear them when you take out the trash.</b>

110
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:08,740
<b>They weren't at all expensive, so no pressure.</b>

111

<b>So tell me.</b>

<b>I went to Jun Seo's school...</b>

<b>His grades are superb,</b>

00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:33,430
<b>who can teach or change someone.</b>

161
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:35,660
<b>I will pay more attention.</b>

162
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:38,330
<b>And if possible, I'll pick him up on Saturdays.</b>

163
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:41,230
<b>You should've done that before.</b>

164
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,900
<b>But honey.</b>

165
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:48,610
<b>Why won't you ask me about...</b>

166
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:50,910
<b>my relations with the model?</b>

167
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:54,710
<b>Do you not care?</b>

168
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:57,020
<b>It's not something to applaud you for,</b>

169
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:59,320
<b>but I feel partially responsible.</b>

170
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:01,590
<b>I was in prison for four years...</b>

171
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,860
<b>and was busy with work before then.</b>

172
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:06,360
<b>Is that it? Aren't you even angry?</b>

173
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,370
<b>It looks like you want to say something.</b>

174
00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:13,570
<b>So I'll ask.</b>

175
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,370
<b>Why did you see another man?</b>

176
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,800
<b>When I happened to be...</b>

177
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:20,340
<b>away in the dark?</b>

178
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:25,710
<b>Because I was lonely.</b>

179
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:30,520
<b>I don't have friends or siblings.</b>

180
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,850
<b>All I have...</b>

181
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:35,160
<b>is Dad and you.</b>

182
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,860
<b>Neither of you were with me then.</b>

183
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:41,390
<b>So...</b>

184
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:43,960
<b>don't make me lonely.</b>

185
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,870
<b>I can't stand being lonely.</b>

186
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:50,840
<b>Liking someone who doesn't like me back.</b>

187
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,640
<b>I hate things like that.</b>

188
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,810
<b>Mr. Han looks great in a suit,</b>

189
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:04,280
<b>so even a basic design like this would work too.</b>

190
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,450
<b>Everyone knows he looks good in a suit.</b>

191
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:09,590
<b>But he has too many with the basic look.</b>

192
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:13,230
<b>I want something with a unique texture or design.</b>

193
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:16,800
<b>Okay. I'll ask our team leader when she arrives.</b>

194
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:22,370
<b>Did the gloves he bought you fit?</b>

195
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,040
<b>What do you mean?</b>

196
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,110
<b>When Mr. Han was last here...</b>

197
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:28,240
<b>Jin Young.</b>

198
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:32,350
<b>What is she talking about?</b>

199
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:34,980
<b>Did Jae Hyun buy something...</b>

200
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,380
<b>when he was here?</b>

201
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:39,750
<b>Was it a woman's item?</b>

202
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:41,990
<b>Well...</b>

203
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:44,790
<b>Bring it to me.</b>

204
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:47,890
<b>Let's see my husband's taste.</b>

205
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:54,870
<b>She's a university friend.</b>

206
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,900
<b>Get up, Yoon Ji Su!</b>

207
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:11,920
<b>Send in Secretary Kim.</b>

208
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:19,730
<b>What's the matter?</b>

209
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:24,500
<b>Number one.</b>

210
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,830
<b>You found Ji Su but didn't tell me.</b>

211
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:27,830
<b>Number two.</b>

212
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:30,000
<b>You liked Ji Su. Which is it?</b>

213
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:32,110
<b>Don't talk nonsense.</b>

214
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:34,140
<b>You met the real Yoon Ji Su?</b>

215
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:37,810
<b>Is she doing okay? No problems?</b>

216
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,380
<b>Her son goes to the same school as my son.</b>

217
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:43,780
<b>Wow, then she married into a rich family.</b>

218
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,790
<b>I was so anxious that...</b>

219
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:48,260
<b>she'd end up...</b>

220
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:51,190
<b>a divorcee who had left a violent husband.</b>

221
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:54,960
<b>So, is she still pretty?</b>

222
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,460
<b>It was number two then.</b>

223
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,400
<b>Number three.</b>

224
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,800
<b>What's that?</b>

225
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:02,270
<b>I think that...</b>

226
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:05,140
<b>Ji Su had a huge crush on me.</b>

227
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:06,440
<b>Didn't she mention me?</b>

228
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:09,740
<b>No.</b>

229
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:19,990
<b>Give me a moment.</b>

230
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:22,290
<b>Take your time. You can't pee if you rush.</b>

231
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:12,920
<b>Yes, ma'am.</b>

232
00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:19,890
<b>Yu Ri's not free today?</b>

233
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:21,860
<b>That's too bad.</b>

234
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:24,690
<b>It's okay.</b>

235
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,630
<b>Thank you.</b>

236
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:36,770
<b>Hello, ma'am.</b>

237
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:40,140
<b>You said that Ha Young's sister wanted to learn the piano.</b>

238
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,480
<b>Really?</b>

239
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:47,280
<b>That can't be helped. Give me a call next time.</b>

240
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:48,990
<b>Thank you.</b>

241
00:22:58,330 --> 00:22:59,330
<b>Ji Su!</b>

242
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,800
<b>It's been a while.</b>

243
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:07,000
<b>How long has it been?</b>

244
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:10,710
<b>About four days.</b>

245
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,710
<b>Really?</b>

246
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:17,880
<b>Wait.</b>

247
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,450
<b>My car's coming. Wait a little bit.</b>

248
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:23,750
<b>I'm fine.</b>

249
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:26,490
<b>I know you are. I want to lend you my umbrella.</b>

250
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:27,860
<b>It's really okay.</b>

251
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:29,590
<b>- I'll just... - You can run,</b>

252
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:30,760
<b>but it's cold.</b>

253
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:34,860
<b>Wait just a little. It'll be here soon.</b>

254
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:41,240
<b>Oh, and I'm not here for some nasty business.</b>

255
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,940
<b>I'm running away from a friend after we had a drink.</b>

256
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:46,210
<b>I didn't ask.</b>

257
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:49,010
<b>Right. You didn't ask.</b>

258
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:50,950
<b>I thought you asked.</b>

259
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:44,230
<b>Pop the trunk for me.</b>

260
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,420
<b>I'm really okay.</b>

261
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:04,950
<b>It'll be a hassle to return.</b>

262
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:08,090
<b>You can keep this too. I have a lot of umbrellas.</b>

263
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,800
<b>Then...</b>

264
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,070
<b>Thank you.</b>

265
00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:18,400
<b>Goodbye.</b>

266
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,100
<b>Yoon Ji Su.</b>

267
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:52,470
<b>What about your bar?</b>

268
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,000
<b>- I closed early. - Why?</b>

269
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,770
<b>Because it's raining.</b>

270
00:25:56,210 --> 00:25:57,740
<b>I want someone to pour me a drink.</b>

271
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:02,280
<b>Jae Hyun?</b>

272
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,750
<b>Where? How?</b>

273
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:08,890
<b>His son goes to Young Min's school.</b>

274
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:13,490
<b>It's an amazing school if Hyung Sung's heir goes there.</b>

275
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:17,760
<b>You knew who he had married?</b>

276
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:21,760
<b>Yes. I read about it. In a magazine interview.</b>

277
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,970
<b>Oh, that?</b>

278
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:26,800
<b>I read that too.</b>

279
00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:33,010
<b>Did you meet Jae Hyun too?</b>

280
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,110
<b>Yes.</b>

281
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:37,180
<b>And?</b>

282
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:39,120
<b>Is he still cool?</b>

283
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,380
<b>Not at all.</b>

284
00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:43,690
<b>He changed.</b>

285
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:47,060
<b>I thought he'd stay cool even with age.</b>

286
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,660
<b>Like a Hollywood star.</b>

287
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:52,660
<b>He does look a bit like George Clooney.</b>

288
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:55,300
<b>No way. How does he look like George Clooney?</b>

289
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:58,130
<b>His eyes. They wrinkle when he smiles.</b>

290
00:26:58,130 --> 00:27:00,700
<b>Whose eyes don't wrinkle at that age when they smile?</b>

291
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:03,170
<b>They aren't just wrinkles. They have a certain depth.</b>

292
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:05,110
<b>They're deep because he's old.</b>

293
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:06,910
<b>No.</b>

294
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:12,780
<b>There's something sexy and dignified about them.</b>

295
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:16,090
<b>You're still head over heels in love with him.</b>

296
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:22,930
<b>(December 1993)</b>

297
00:27:22,930 --> 00:27:24,090
<b>Oh, come on!</b>

298
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:25,900
<b>Okay, my bad.</b>

299
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,300
<b>Isn't he just so good-looking?</b>

300
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:31,730
<b>This is insane. What exactly is good-looking about him?</b>

301
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,770
<b>He's so thin, he looks like a withering bean sprout.</b>

302
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,840
<b>Look at how he moves.</b>

303
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:40,410
<b>Whenever he gets the ball, foot volleyball turns into ballet.</b>

304
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:44,810
<b>That's why he's so useless. Because he's dancing, not kicking.</b>

305
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:47,450
<b>- Here you go. - It's mine.</b>

306
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:51,850
<b>What was that? Was that ballet?</b>

307
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:53,620
<b>Will you kick properly?</b>

308
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,930
<b>- You said it's your ball. - When did I say that?</b>

309
00:27:55,930 --> 00:27:57,430
<b>It wasn't even in my direction.</b>

310
00:27:57,430 --> 00:27:58,530
<b>Nice one.</b>

311
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:03,270
<b>Jae Hyun finally looks like a real university student now.</b>

312
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:05,500
<b>Jae Hyun, Jae Hyun.</b>

313
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:08,270
<b>Are you a flatfish? With eyes just for one man?</b>

314
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:10,840
<b>I wish he'd play sports instead of protest.</b>

315
00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:12,810
<b>Wake up. As if a dog can quit eating poop.</b>

316
00:28:12,910 --> 00:28:14,710
<b>No dog can be that handsome.</b>

317
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:18,750
<b>You're not just head over heels in love. You have a disease.</b>

318

<b>Kick properly.</b>

319
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:27,660
<b>Go on home.</b>

320
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:29,930
<b>Shall I come along when you get Young Min?</b>

321
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:31,660
<b>It's a long train ride.</b>

322
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:33,560
<b>Forget it.</b>

323
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,670
<b>My feelings for you are a disease.</b>

324
00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:45,710
<b>A terminal disease.</b>

325
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:56,550
<b>- Hey, Dong Jin. - Where are you?</b>

326
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:58,920
<b>You're still there?</b>

327
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:00,490
<b>I thought you were pooping.</b>

328
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:02,630
<b>Did you leave to avoid paying the bill?</b>

329
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:06,100
<b>Hey. Are you really short on cash these days?</b>

330
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:08,300
<b>You asked how much lawyers make.</b>

331
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:11,300
<b>Why are you acting out of character?</b>

332
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:12,570
<b>Hey, Dong Jin.</b>

333
00:29:13,370 --> 00:29:15,710
<b>How about your kids learn to play the piano?</b>

334
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:17,870
<b>My kids? Sure, why not?</b>

335

<b>One is a year old and the other is three.</b>

336

<b>It's time they learn the piano, and they're both boys too.</b>

337
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,580
<b>Yes, it's time.</b>

338
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:28,350
<b>What do you mean it's time?</b>

339
00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:33,620
<b>- Dong Jin. - What do you want now?</b>

340
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,990
<b>- When will it next rain? - Are you barking mad?</b>

341
00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:40,830
<b>Ask that to the weather forecaster. You jerk.</b>

<b>Son, didn't you get your report card?</b>

345
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:13,360
<b>Hey, Jun Seo. I'm here. Come down now.</b>

346
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,000
<b>Okay.</b>

347

<b>Aren't you Young Min?</b>

<b>Do you remember me?</b>

<b>I'm Jun Seo's father.</b>

350

<b>Hello.</b>

351
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,220
<b>Hi.</b>

352
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:37,250
<b>Do you not like me?</b>

353
00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:40,790
<b>Because I might be on his side?</b>

354
00:30:42,930 --> 00:30:44,960
<b>Not all dads are on their sons' sides.</b>

355
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:47,860
<b>I'm on the losing side.</b>

356
00:30:51,370 --> 00:30:53,370
<b>I wanted to tell you this.</b>

357
00:30:56,210 --> 00:30:57,310
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

358
00:30:58,710 --> 00:31:00,710
<b>But I was the one who messed up.</b>

359
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:04,810
<b>It's not about just winning, losing, or making mistakes.</b>

360
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:08,990
<b>Given what happened, I'm sure my son is responsible for this too.</b>

361
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:11,450
<b>How do you know that?</b>

362
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:13,190
<b>I just do.</b>

363
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,630
<b>Some things become obvious at my age.</b>

364
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:18,960
<b>Which brings me to my question.</b>

365
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:22,430
<b>It looks like you're troubled.</b>

366
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:26,700
<b>Does Jun Seo still bully you?</b>

367
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:33,740
<b>I see.</b>

368
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:38,480
<b>That's not the only reason.</b>

369
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:44,050
<b>My grades went down a lot.</b>

<b>It took me all night yesterday to follow the recipes from...</b>

372
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:05,610
<b>Mr. Baek and Kim Soo Mi.</b>

373
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:07,180
<b>Try it.</b>

374
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:08,640
<b>I'm not hungry.</b>

375
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,780
<b>Come on. You should eat some though.</b>

376
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:16,450
<b>The school can give you all the food you want,</b>

377
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:17,950
<b>but it's not good.</b>

378
00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:21,390
<b>Hold on.</b>

379
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:25,860
<b>Aunt Hye Jung bought this...</b>

<b>for you because you're still growing.</b>

381

<b>Isn't it good?</b>

382
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,220
<b>Jun Seo's dad...</b>

383
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:51,320
<b>is very different from Jun Seo.</b>

384
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,420
<b>Is that so?</b>

385
00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:56,360
<b>How did he seem?</b>

386
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:58,290
<b>He's kind...</b>

387
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:00,200
<b>and warmhearted.</b>

388
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,270
<b>He looked kind of cold to me.</b>

389
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,570
<b>I was never envious...</b>

390
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:09,340
<b>of his rich family.</b>

391
00:33:12,170 --> 00:33:14,210
<b>But I'm kind of envious that he's Jun Seo's dad.</b>

392
00:33:21,850 --> 00:33:23,690
<b>But you have an awesome mom.</b>

393
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:29,230
<b>Young Min,</b>

394
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:31,090
<b>I want you...</b>

395
00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:34,160
<b>to worry as much as a kid around your age.</b>

396
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:36,170
<b>What do you mean?</b>

397
00:33:36,370 --> 00:33:38,000
<b>"What will happen if I do this?"</b>

398
00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:40,070
<b>"I shouldn't do that, right?"</b>

399
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:42,740
<b>"Yes. Let's just put it up with a bit longer."</b>

400
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:45,470
<b>Stop thinking about others.</b>

401
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,110
<b>If you're hurt, tell me that you are.</b>

402
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,580
<b>"Why is everyone bothering me?"</b>

403
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,550
<b>Get upset like this too.</b>

404
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:08,030
<b>Just like you threw a chair at Jun Seo,</b>

405
00:34:08,430 --> 00:34:10,830
<b>I'm sure he must have given you a hard time too.</b>

406
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:13,340
<b>And you're dealing with it on your own.</b>

407
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:17,610
<b>And all the adults are talking about how awful throwing a chair is.</b>

408
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:23,280
<b>Young Min.</b>

409
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:27,420
<b>You're not an adult.</b>

410
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:30,420
<b>Why are you putting up with this by yourself?</b>

411
00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:36,260
<b>That's cheating. And it's illegal too.</b>

412
00:34:38,330 --> 00:34:40,030
<b>But you're alone.</b>

413
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
<b>You have to make money by yourself...</b>

414
00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:45,170
<b>and raise me by yourself.</b>

415
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:49,540
<b>And my grandparents can't help you either.</b>

416
00:34:50,910 --> 00:34:52,710
<b>You must do everything by yourself.</b>

417
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,380
<b>And if something happens to me,</b>

418
00:34:56,050 --> 00:34:58,710
<b>you have to stop everything and come to me.</b>

419
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,950
<b>That's why you should tell me everything.</b>

420
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:04,590
<b>We only have each other.</b>

421
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:05,920
<b>That's right.</b>

422
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:09,090
<b>I'm the only one you have,</b>

423
00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:11,860
<b>but if I kicked out of school,</b>

424
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,530
<b>Dad might take me from you.</b>

425
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,040
<b>Young Min.</b>

426
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:24,370
<b>No one can take you from me.</b>

427
00:35:24,570 --> 00:35:26,740
<b>Actually, you don't know about this,</b>

428
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,010
<b>but I'm like...</b>

429
00:35:30,610 --> 00:35:33,720
<b>Black Widow or Captain Marvel, the characters you like.</b>

430
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,580
<b>I'm as strong as those superheroes.</b>

431
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,990
<b>Get that. My gosh.</b>

432
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:41,690
<b>Are you okay? Does it hurt?</b>

433
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,330
<b>I'm not crying because it hurts.</b>

434
00:35:55,370 --> 00:35:57,970
<b>I heard you've been working. But nothing has changed.</b>

435
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:01,040
<b>I told you to get rid of those women.</b>

436
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:04,080
<b>Are you rebelling against me?</b>

437
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:06,450
<b>No.</b>

438
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:08,520
<b>Why are you making him do such dirty works?</b>

439
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:09,850
<b>He has other people for that.</b>

440
00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:12,760
<b>He's the best at getting rid of people.</b>

441
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,160
<b>Do you not want to work?</b>

442
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:17,630
<b>No.</b>

443
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:19,900
<b>Then, get rid of them within a week.</b>

444
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:22,930
<b>I can't let our company get messy with those lowlives.</b>

445
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:25,000
<b>The foreign buyers are visiting us.</b>

446
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:26,070
<b>Yes, sir.</b>

447
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:30,310
<b>Instead of removing those women,</b>

448
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:33,140
<b>why were you meeting up with the head of Seoul Bank?</b>

449
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:34,310
<b>Do you need money?</b>

450
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,310
<b>I don't think he's tailing me yet.</b>

451
00:36:37,310 --> 00:36:38,650
<b>From assemblymen...</b>

452
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:40,350
<b>to Madam Jung in Cheongdam-dong.</b>

453
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:42,990
<b>I heard the old geezer has a lot of connections.</b>

454
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:44,250
<b>I guess it was all true.</b>

455
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:45,650
<b>It's not a surprise at all.</b>

456
00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:47,190
<b>That's how he grew his company.</b>

457
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:49,860
<b>The surveillance cameras from the police will be watching you.</b>

458
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:52,430
<b>I can't be caught on those surveillance cameras.</b>

459
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,830
<b>So we need to make a move without letting them know.</b>

460
00:36:54,830 --> 00:36:57,800
<b>- Can you do it? - Yes. I must be invisible.</b>

461
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,440
<b>Right. Get me the list of workers who got fired.</b>

462
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:02,140
<b>I need to look into someone.</b>

463
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:04,670
<b>(Application: Name, Yoon Ji Su)</b>

464
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:06,010
<b>What's her angle?</b>

465
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:09,710
<b>Doesn't this look like she approached him on purpose?</b>

466
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:12,550
<b>She was hired when the vice-president was imprisoned.</b>

467
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:13,880
<b>It's a bit tricky to say.</b>

468
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:14,880
<b>Does Jae Hyun know?</b>

469
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,520
<b>Unless she told him about her situation,</b>

470
00:37:17,690 --> 00:37:19,460
<b>he wouldn't have found out.</b>

471
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,820
<b>There are over 1,000 workers...</b>

472
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:22,320
<b>who were terminated.</b>

473
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,330
<b>He cannot know.</b>

<b>don't want you to join the protest in front of the building.</b>

<b>Why shouldn't I join them?</b>

513

<b>I was unfairly fired too.</b>

<b>No.</b>

520

<b>I believe raising your son...</b>

<b>You're not the guy I used to know.</b>

526

<b>Yes.</b>

527
00:40:15,130 --> 00:40:16,600
<b>I'm a completely different man.</b>

<b>I am incredibly selfish and materialistic.</b>

<b>The temporary workers who are protesting right now...</b>

<b>it's better if you stay out of it.</b>

535

<b>No.</b>

<b>Is it some kind of loyalty for your colleagues?</b>

<b>Or is it a sense of justice?</b>

<b>You won't make money off it anyway.</b>

540
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:03,620

<b>- PV campaign? - It's like the farming campaign.</b>

549

<b>It's a campaign to help poor villages.</b>

<b>Why do you participate in this campaign?</b>

<b>I want the losing side to be my side.</b>

<b>Everyone says the winning side is their side.</b>

<b>And the losing side is always lonely and sad.</b>

<b>Should you be taking sides right now?</b>

<b>I haven't won a lot in my life,</b>

<b>When it comes to toxicity, I can beat micro-dust, hands down.</b>

<b>Right.</b>

598
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:21,290
<b>The micro-dust must feel offended.</b>

<b>So I'll take your side.</b>

605

<b>Teaming up with me will be hard. You can't handle it.</b>

<b>But I heard he's not a bad person.</b>

<b>Besides, he's the son-in-law of the chairman.</b>

<b>So he'll side with the company.</b>

<b>But still, it's huge progress.</b>

<b>You didn't even talk to me first.</b>

<b>Didn't you tell me to take care of it?</b>

683
