<b>(Episode 13)</b>

2
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:09,129
<b>Let's get going.</b>

3
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:15,029
<b>I think I can manage.</b>

4
00:00:16,669 --> 00:00:17,830
<b>Manage what?</b>

5
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:19,470
<b>Being friends.</b>

6
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:23,339
<b>I think...</b>

7
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:25,579
<b>I can manage...</b>

8
00:00:27,239 --> 00:00:29,649
<b>to be friends with you.</b>

9
00:00:43,789 --> 00:00:44,990
<b>Bang Guk Bong.</b>

10
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:52,500
<b>I'm going to wait for him
a bit more.</b>

11
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:54,840
<b>You can go without me.</b>

12
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:58,679
<b>Why?</b>

13
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,039
<b>Because I think
he's going to show up.</b>

14
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:02,350
<b>He's not coming.</b>

15
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:04,979
<b>You've waited enough.</b>

16
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:06,950
<b>He promised...</b>

17
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:10,189
<b>that he'll be there for me.</b>

18
00:01:19,099 --> 00:01:20,260
<b>Do you really mean that?</b>

19
00:01:22,469 --> 00:01:23,469
<b>Yes.</b>

20
00:01:58,769 --> 00:02:00,370
<b>This is where I live.</b>

<b>(Sliced peaches)</b>

25
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:41,340
<b>Do you know where they sell peaches?</b>

26
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,789
<b>Without this,</b>

27

<b>Hong Jo.</b>

29
00:03:06,569 --> 00:03:07,599
<b>Hong Jo.</b>

30
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:54,050
<b>Why did you come back?</b>

31
00:03:57,189 --> 00:03:58,319
<b>Isn't that Hong Jo's collar?</b>

32
00:04:00,789 --> 00:04:03,189
<b>- How do you have this?
- I found it outside.</b>

33
00:04:03,289 --> 00:04:04,560
<b>What do you mean?</b>

34
00:04:04,789 --> 00:04:05,936
<b>Where? How?</b>

35
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,675
<b>You should check if Hong Jo's home.</b>

36
00:04:07,699 --> 00:04:09,276
<b>Do you think he's okay?</b>

37
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,645
<b>Check if he's home first.
I'll search the neighborhood.</b>

38
00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:12,800
<b>Okay.</b>

39
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:19,379
<b>Hong Jo.</b>

40
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,310
<b>Hong Jo.</b>

41
00:04:23,709 --> 00:04:24,750
<b>Hong Jo.</b>

42
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:48,910
<b>Did you find Hong Jo?</b>

43
00:04:49,009 --> 00:04:50,769
<b>No. Wasn't he home?</b>

44
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:51,910
<b>No.</b>

45
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,079
<b>Isn't it weird?</b>

46
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:56,149
<b>How did this come off?</b>

47
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:58,480
<b>And what was he doing so far away?</b>

48
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:00,779
<b>It couldn't have come off
on its own.</b>

49
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:03,795
<b>I think someone took it off
on purpose.</b>

50
00:05:03,819 --> 00:05:06,065
<b>You mean someone did it
to steal Hong Jo?</b>

51
00:05:06,089 --> 00:05:08,196
<b>- Or do you think...
- Let's look for him again tomorrow.</b>

52
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,935
<b>No, we should look for him now.</b>

53
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:11,136
<b>We won't be able to find him...</b>

54
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,860
<b>if someone took him away on purpose.</b>

55
00:05:13,699 --> 00:05:15,930
<b>- And it's really late.
- My gosh.</b>

56
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,540
<b>I can't believe this happened again.</b>

57
00:05:18,699 --> 00:05:21,240
<b>I... I seriously lost him
this time, didn't I?</b>

58
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:22,709
<b>This time...</b>

59
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:29,879
<b>This time,</b>

60
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:32,550
<b>I'll help you find him.</b>

61
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:35,449
<b>We'll be able to find him.</b>

62
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:38,819
<b>He's not a normal cat.</b>

63
00:05:44,329 --> 00:05:46,536
<b>Can you take a look at this?
Thank you.</b>

64

70

<b>I'm sorry.</b>

71
00:06:02,379 --> 00:06:03,410
<b>Are you okay?</b>

72
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:05,149
<b>Yes, I'm okay.</b>

73
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,840
<b>Bang Guk Bong didn't
come home last night either.</b>

74
00:06:12,689 --> 00:06:14,589
<b>I wonder if something also
came up with him.</b>

75

<b>Can you please take a look at this?

<b>Hey, let's eat lunch.</b>

78
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,795
<b>I'm going to eat lunch at home.</b>

79
00:06:43,819 --> 00:06:44,819
<b>Again?</b>

80
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:47,036
<b>Are you hiding a pot of gold
at your house or something?</b>

81
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:49,259
<b>- You guys can eat without me.
- Okay.</b>

<b>(We're looking for a missing cat!)</b>

83

<b>There are so many people
who have lost their cats.</b>

84
00:07:08,579 --> 00:07:09,586
<b>You're right.</b>

85
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:11,286
<b>(We're looking for a missing cat.)</b>

86
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:12,755
<b>It's kind of weird.</b>

87
00:07:12,779 --> 00:07:14,425
<b>(We're looking for a missing cat.)</b>

88
00:07:14,449 --> 00:07:16,250
<b>It's like someone's kidnapping them.</b>

89
00:07:23,189 --> 00:07:25,829
<b>Hello. Can I ask you something?</b>

90
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,977
<b>Sure.</b>

91
00:07:27,001 --> 00:07:30,930
<b>Have you ever seen
anyone suspicious around here?</b>

92
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,639
<b>I'm not sure. Why?</b>

93
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:37,485
<b>I lost my cat.</b>

94
00:07:37,509 --> 00:07:39,855
<b>And I was wondering
if you might know anything.</b>

95
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:41,480
<b>Oh, dear.</b>

96
00:07:41,939 --> 00:07:44,910
<b>There's a man who comes here
to feed the cats.</b>

97
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:46,980
<b>But he's a kind person.</b>

98
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:49,226
<b>Have you ever noticed
anything strange about him?</b>

99
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:50,526
<b>For example,
did he ever take them home?</b>

100
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:52,560
<b>I've seen him
taking them a few times.</b>

101
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:56,435
<b>My goodness.</b>

102
00:07:56,459 --> 00:07:58,305
<b>He takes them to the hospital.</b>

103
00:07:58,329 --> 00:08:01,560
<b>He treats the wounded cats
and neuters them.</b>

104
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:03,029
<b>He neuters them?</b>

105
00:08:04,069 --> 00:08:06,870
<b>Why doesn't he ask
the borough office to do that?</b>

106
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:10,040
<b>He does a whole lot of things
for stray cats.</b>

107
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:12,716
<b>All I do is feed them dry kibble.</b>

108
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:14,939
<b>But he even gets them canned food.</b>

109
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,519
<b>By any chance,
do you know his number?</b>

110
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:26,720
<b>I brought a new friend.</b>

111
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,360
<b>He's going to wake up soon,
so you guys should say hello.</b>

112
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:39,115
<b>From what I know, he works
at the nearby garage.</b>

113
00:08:39,139 --> 00:08:40,799
<b>The youngest in our team?</b>

114
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,840
<b>He goes around feeding stray cats.</b>

115
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,269
<b>But he went home today.</b>

116
00:08:46,009 --> 00:08:48,009
<b>Can you tell us his address
or phone number?</b>

117
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:53,149
<b>I can't tell you his personal
information without his permission.</b>

118
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,320
<b>(Don't leave your car
with just enyone.)</b>

119
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:04,789
<b>Thank you.</b>

120
00:09:05,929 --> 00:09:07,029
<b>What is it?</b>

121
00:09:08,659 --> 00:09:12,100
<b>It should be "anyone", not "enyone".</b>

122
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:15,399
<b>I can't stand typos.
It's part of my job.</b>

123
00:09:15,669 --> 00:09:18,710
<b>If you lost your cat,
don't waste your time here.</b>

124
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:22,580
<b>Instead, go to your parking lot
and tap on the car hoods.</b>

125
00:09:22,909 --> 00:09:25,326
<b>Cats tend to hide there
when the weather gets cold...</b>

126
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:29,250
<b>because the engine remains warm
even after you turn it off.</b>

127
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:31,696
<b>- Thank you.
- I hope you find your cat.</b>

128
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,759
<b>Okay.</b>

129
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:40,399
<b>Are you here?</b>

130
00:09:52,539 --> 00:09:53,610
<b>Or are you here?</b>

131
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:01,480
<b>There you are.</b>

132
00:10:05,419 --> 00:10:06,690
<b>We should go home now.</b>

133
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:10,230
<b>I'll visit the garage again
tomorrow.</b>

134
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:19,000
<b>Wait.</b>

135
00:10:25,309 --> 00:10:26,580
<b>We meet again.</b>

136
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:30,179
<b>What brings you here?</b>

137
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,610
<b>(We're looking for a missing cat!)</b>

138
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,519
<b>Did you lose him?</b>

139
00:10:37,789 --> 00:10:39,990
<b>See? I told you...</b>

140
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,059
<b>to take good care of him.</b>

141
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:46,129
<b>She didn't lose him.</b>

142
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:49,600
<b>It looks like someone stole him.</b>

143
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:59,710
<b>He's probably
with a better owner now.</b>

144
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:02,580
<b>Just mind your own business.</b>

145
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:14,059
<b>May I take a look?</b>

146
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,566
<b>What are you doing?</b>

147
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:20,059
<b>Are you trying to imply
that I stole the cat?</b>

148
00:11:23,129 --> 00:11:25,346
<b>You're the one
who left your cat outside.</b>

149
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:26,576
<b>And now, you're suspecting me?</b>

150
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:30,570
<b>I'm sorry, but this is just trash.</b>

151
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:36,009
<b>You're lying.</b>

152
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:39,649
<b>It's a cat.</b>

153
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:07,009
<b>Stop right there!</b>

154
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:15,950
<b>Stop!</b>

155
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:23,190
<b>- Hey!
- Stop right there!</b>

156
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:41,940
<b>Hong Jo!</b>

157

00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:51,990
<b>Be quiet.</b>

160
00:12:58,230 --> 00:12:59,259
<b>Wait.</b>

161
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:17,210
<b>Please be quiet. Be quiet
for a little while. I'm sorry.</b>

162
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:19,250
<b>Be quiet. Stay quiet.</b>

163
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:25,590
<b>What is it?</b>

164
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:27,759
<b>Look.</b>

165
00:13:30,129 --> 00:13:31,306
<b>"Enyone".</b>

166
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:32,405
<b>(Don't leave your car
with just enyone.)</b>

167
00:13:32,429 --> 00:13:35,700
<b>It should be "anyone", not "enyone".</b>

168
00:13:35,929 --> 00:13:37,000
<b>It's a typo.</b>

169
00:13:37,129 --> 00:13:39,269
<b>(Don't leave your car
with just enyone.)</b>

170
00:13:47,139 --> 00:13:48,639
<b>Are you home?</b>

171
00:13:49,309 --> 00:13:51,279
<b>Mister! My goodness.</b>

172
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:52,995
<b>What do you want?</b>

173
00:13:53,019 --> 00:13:55,755
<b>Your cats meow and cry
day and night.</b>

174
00:13:55,779 --> 00:13:57,926
<b>The kid upstairs
cries day and night too.</b>

175
00:13:57,950 --> 00:14:01,566
<b>What? The other tenants
complain about the noise...</b>

176
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:03,735
<b>- and smell.
- They're not as noisy as humans.</b>

177
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:06,405
<b>Humans smell more too, like you.</b>

178
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:09,306
<b>What did you say?
You're out of your mind.</b>

179
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:10,429
<b>Hey!</b>

180
00:14:10,899 --> 00:14:14,240
<b>Open the door! He's just mad.</b>

181
00:14:24,379 --> 00:14:25,480
<b>What...</b>

182
00:14:27,879 --> 00:14:28,919
<b>You...</b>

183
00:14:32,019 --> 00:14:33,690
<b>How did you...</b>

184
00:14:35,259 --> 00:14:36,590
<b>get in?</b>

185
00:14:36,629 --> 00:14:38,190
<b>Why do you do this?</b>

186
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:39,629
<b>I...</b>

187
00:14:39,929 --> 00:14:42,735
<b>I... I...</b>

188
00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:44,806
<b>I saved them all.</b>

189
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:46,000
<b>You locked them up.</b>

190
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:48,216
<b>And display them like objects.</b>

191
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,409
<b>They'd all be dead
if they were left outdoors.</b>

192
00:14:51,509 --> 00:14:53,285
<b>They get hit by a car or freeze.</b>

193
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:55,456
<b>Or get stuck in a car's hood.</b>

194
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,649
<b>Cats...</b>

195
00:14:58,309 --> 00:15:00,355
<b>die if they get abandoned.</b>

196
00:15:00,379 --> 00:15:02,620
<b>Not all those here were abandoned.</b>

197
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:04,667
<b>You stole some.</b>

198
00:15:04,691 --> 00:15:08,296
<b>Don't... I couldn't stand people
who don't deserve to have a cat.</b>

199
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,929
<b>People exactly like you.</b>

200
00:15:13,029 --> 00:15:16,676
<b>You get one because it's cute,
then leave it on the street.</b>

201
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,429
<b>When it gets old and sick,</b>

202
00:15:19,429 --> 00:15:21,139
<b>you'll just let it go.</b>

203
00:15:21,799 --> 00:15:22,870
<b>No?</b>

204
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,480
<b>Then what right do you have...</b>

205
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,485
<b>to collect cats?</b>

206
00:15:32,509 --> 00:15:34,149
<b>I like them.</b>

207
00:15:34,419 --> 00:15:39,250
<b>I like cats and
I want to be with them.</b>

208
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:42,135
<b>Open the door!</b>

209
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:43,206
<b>- You...
- Excuse us.</b>

210
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:45,605
<b>- My gosh.
- Hey. Open the door.</b>

211
00:15:45,629 --> 00:15:47,735
<b>- Hong Jo!
- Why are you here?</b>

212
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:49,570
<b>I think he took our cat.</b>

213
00:15:50,529 --> 00:15:51,846
<b>Hong Jo!</b>

214
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:52,847
<b>- Get out.
- Hong Jo!</b>

215
00:15:52,871 --> 00:15:54,775
<b>- Let them go.
- Get out!</b>

216
00:15:54,799 --> 00:15:56,000
<b>Let them go.</b>

217
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:57,586
<b>Every one of them.</b>

218
00:15:57,610 --> 00:15:59,269
<b>- Open the door!
- Hong Jo!</b>

219
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:01,009
<b>Let us in!</b>

220
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:06,750
<b>They're my cats.</b>

221
00:16:07,419 --> 00:16:10,395
<b>Without them, I can't live either.</b>

222
00:16:10,419 --> 00:16:11,649
<b>Don't do this.</b>

223
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,120
<b>Let go!</b>

224
00:16:24,029 --> 00:16:26,840
<b>I told you to leave them alone.</b>

225
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:32,269
<b>Darn you.</b>

226
00:16:42,019 --> 00:16:44,196
<b>Step aside. I'm glad
I have an excuse.</b>

227
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:48,389
<b>I need to see just what kind of
mess he made inside.</b>

228
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:10,150
<b>What's wrong?</b>

229
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,019
<b>Hong Jo!</b>

230
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:16,589
<b>Hong Jo!</b>

231
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,795
<b>Are you okay? Were you hurt?</b>

232
00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:21,160
<b>I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.</b>

233
00:17:22,519 --> 00:17:24,230
<b>Oh, no...</b>

234
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:26,660
<b>Are you okay?</b>

235
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,430
<b>An animal hoarder?</b>

236
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,799
<b>What on earth is this mess?</b>

237
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:35,400
<b>How many cats are there?
This is disgusting!</b>

238
00:17:36,609 --> 00:17:37,910
<b>A person...</b>

239
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:41,809
<b>turned into a cat.</b>

240
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:46,579
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

241
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:51,049
<b>Hong Jo.</b>

242
00:18:11,509 --> 00:18:13,956
<b>Not only was he hurt,</b>

243
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:17,849
<b>but he's also dehydrated.
I'll keep him here for the night.</b>

244
00:18:19,549 --> 00:18:21,595
<b>I wanted to be with him.</b>

245
00:18:21,619 --> 00:18:25,589
<b>If you leave something
with your smell, he'll calm down.</b>

246
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:27,990
<b>Oh. Okay.</b>

247
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:32,005
<b>- Here you go.
- Okay.</b>

248
00:18:32,029 --> 00:18:33,529
<b>Oh, and...</b>

249
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:55,650
<b>I'm home.</b>

250
00:19:03,789 --> 00:19:06,130
<b>I just got my cat back.</b>

251
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:31,690
<b>Did he go traveling?</b>

252
00:19:36,119 --> 00:19:38,130
<b>Cats are like that.</b>

253
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:40,799
<b>They're not around when you want...</b>

254
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:50,210
<b>You...</b>

255
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,940
<b>I'm sorry I couldn't
keep my promise.</b>

256
00:19:57,309 --> 00:20:01,150
<b>Well, I was a bit
out of sorts myself.</b>

257
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,589
<b>Something happened to Hong Jo.</b>

258
00:20:05,019 --> 00:20:06,759
<b>I'm sorry that you had to...</b>

259
00:20:07,619 --> 00:20:08,859
<b>go through that too.</b>

260
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:15,259
<b>Did Jae Seon tell you?</b>

261
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:18,700
<b>I wanted to come to you too.</b>

262
00:20:19,769 --> 00:20:21,599
<b>I wanted to be there for you.</b>

263
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,809
<b>Did something come up?</b>

264
00:20:26,509 --> 00:20:28,079
<b>Where were you?</b>

265
00:20:31,849 --> 00:20:32,950
<b>What?</b>

266
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:35,250
<b>You can't say?</b>

267
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:38,150
<b>I couldn't tell you.</b>

268
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:40,559
<b>There was...</b>

269
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:44,490
<b>nothing I could do.</b>

270
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:48,430
<b>Even if I wanted to come to you,
without you,</b>

271
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,099
<b>I couldn't be with you.</b>

272
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:57,140
<b>You're talking gibberish again.</b>

273
00:20:58,839 --> 00:21:01,980
<b>I'm sorry. It was your mother's
death anniversary.</b>

274
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:05,150
<b>It's fine.</b>

275
00:21:05,809 --> 00:21:07,279
<b>I'm used to it.</b>

276
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:10,490
<b>Everyone around me is like a cat.</b>

277
00:21:11,589 --> 00:21:12,950
<b>So was my mom.</b>

278
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:17,460
<b>She had cancer and she didn't
tell me until right before she died.</b>

279
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,529
<b>Everyone has their own nightmare.</b>

280
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:24,829
<b>Do you know what mine is?</b>

281
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:29,869
<b>I ask a question and no one answers.</b>

282
00:21:33,809 --> 00:21:35,509
<b>And then they all disappear.</b>

283
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:40,650
<b>I forgot for a while...</b>

284
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,549
<b>that you're a cat like them all.</b>

285
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:50,359
<b>Why did you have to be a cat?</b>

286
00:21:55,859 --> 00:21:58,400
<b>Where on earth did he go?</b>

287
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,670
<b>I don't get him at all.</b>

288
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:06,210
<b>Still, he didn't go on a trip.</b>

289
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,150
<b>What am I saying?</b>

290
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:21,420
<b>Why did I have to fall for
a guy like a cat?</b>

291
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:42,809
<b>Yes.</b>

292
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:46,450
<b>I don't know how he got out,
but he came home overnight.</b>

293
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:50,390
<b>He seems fine,
so I'll keep him at home.</b>

294
00:22:51,049 --> 00:22:52,849
<b>I'll wire you the hospital fee.</b>

295
00:22:53,319 --> 00:22:54,460
<b>Bye.</b>

296
00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:01,059
<b>You should've stayed at the clinic.
Did you have to break out?</b>

297
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:04,230
<b>You're such a nuisance
to take care of.</b>

298
00:23:05,529 --> 00:23:08,039
<b>Why did it have to be me?</b>

299
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,869
<b>"Why"?</b>

300
00:23:10,769 --> 00:23:12,410
<b>That's what Sol Ah said.</b>

301
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:14,339
<b>"Why did you have to be a cat?"</b>

302
00:23:15,509 --> 00:23:16,809
<b>What do you mean?</b>

303
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:21,049
<b>I disappeared without a word.</b>

304
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:24,720
<b>I made a promise,
but she had to wait all by herself.</b>

305
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:28,420
<b>I did exactly what you did to her.</b>

306
00:23:28,859 --> 00:23:30,259
<b>What I did reminded her of you.</b>

307
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:35,430
<b>That's what
she meant by that, right?</b>

308
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:37,869
<b>That's not quite what I meant.</b>

309
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:41,400
<b>I happened to find out your secret.</b>

310
00:23:43,339 --> 00:23:46,940
<b>So I was the only person
who could save you.</b>

311
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:48,380
<b>But...</b>

312
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:53,156
<b>unfortunately,
you're just an ungrateful cat...</b>

313
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:55,119
<b>who doesn't even know
how to thank me.</b>

314
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:04,190
<b>I don't want to say this.</b>

315
00:24:06,859 --> 00:24:07,859
<b>But thank you.</b>

316
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:10,529
<b>Why didn't you want to say that?</b>

317
00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:14,369
<b>Because you were there for Sol Ah
when I couldn't be there.</b>

318
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,880
<b>That's not exactly
the right thing to say.</b>

319
00:24:18,509 --> 00:24:19,670
<b>It's natural for me...</b>

320
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,440
<b>to be there for Sol Ah.</b>

321
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,619
<b>"To be there for Sol Ah"?</b>

322
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:33,220
<b>I guess I also thought
it was natural.</b>

323
00:24:33,619 --> 00:24:36,519
<b>I guess I got used to talking,
picking things up,</b>

324
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:39,330
<b>and opening doors
like a human being.</b>

325
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,700
<b>I felt so frustrated and pathetic...</b>

326
00:24:43,259 --> 00:24:45,000
<b>because I couldn't do anything.</b>

327
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,200
<b>But that's what I normally am.</b>

328
00:24:47,869 --> 00:24:50,140
<b>I'm actually nothing without Sol Ah.</b>

329
00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:52,710
<b>But I promised to be there
for her...</b>

330
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:57,910
<b>without knowing that my existence
could end up harming her.</b>

331
00:25:01,319 --> 00:25:02,920
<b>Just like the guy who locked me up.</b>

332
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:06,549
<b>I can't believe this.</b>

333
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:09,770
<b>Are you consulting me
about your feelings for Sol Ah?</b>

334
00:25:10,589 --> 00:25:13,829
<b>Seriously? You're talking to me
about Sol Ah?</b>

335
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,930
<b>You didn't hurt Sol Ah.</b>

336
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,839
<b>You're not
that important to her yet.</b>

337
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,309
<b>What happened to the other cats?</b>

338
00:25:36,779 --> 00:25:38,589
<b>They're still locked inside a cage.</b>

339
00:25:40,589 --> 00:25:43,460
<b>I'm going to upload their photos
and help them find their owners.</b>

340
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:47,430
<b>And I'll help the homeless ones
find new homes.</b>

341
00:25:48,029 --> 00:25:49,229
<b>What if you can't find anyone?</b>

342
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,800
<b>How long are you
going to keep them locked up?</b>

343
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:54,575
<b>A month at most.</b>

344
00:25:54,599 --> 00:25:57,539
<b>What about after that?
Will they be set free?</b>

345
00:26:03,849 --> 00:26:05,980
<b>We'll have to put them to sleep.</b>

346
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:09,740
<b>But we should still try our best.</b>

347
00:26:16,119 --> 00:26:17,490
<b>I guess that guy...</b>

348
00:26:18,529 --> 00:26:20,299
<b>wasn't entirely wrong.</b>

349
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:23,730
<b>They'd all be dead
if they were left outdoors.</b>

350
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:25,906
<b>They get hit by a car or freeze.</b>

351
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:29,069
<b>Cats die if they get abandoned.</b>

352
00:26:36,539 --> 00:26:37,809
<b>I'm sorry for coming so late.</b>

353
00:26:39,009 --> 00:26:40,049
<b>Thank you.</b>

354
00:26:41,049 --> 00:26:42,920
<b>I can't believe the cat
was actually stolen.</b>

355
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:45,720
<b>My goodness, what a horrible person.</b>

356
00:26:46,049 --> 00:26:48,089
<b>She must've been scared.</b>

357
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:50,019
<b>No.</b>

358
00:26:50,829 --> 00:26:53,590
<b>She had fun because she got to see
the other cats in the neighborhood.</b>

359
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,630
<b>That's a relief.</b>

360
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:09,910
<b>- Are you waiting for a call?
- What?</b>

361
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:13,380
<b>No, I'm not.</b>

362
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,549
<b>Then do you want to call someone?</b>

363
00:27:16,349 --> 00:27:18,669
<b>Just call that person instead of
fidgeting with your phone.</b>

364
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:21,390
<b>No.</b>

365
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,430
<b>I guess she still hasn't
recovered from her cold.</b>

366
00:27:33,529 --> 00:27:35,400
<b>- Did you call her?
- Me?</b>

367
00:27:36,269 --> 00:27:37,309
<b>Why would I call her?</b>

368
00:27:37,869 --> 00:27:40,440
<b>Come on. She went to school with us.</b>

369
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:43,609
<b>Oh, okay. I'll call her later.</b>

370
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:53,759
<b>- Why...
- Why...</b>

371
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:57,120
<b>- Why are you following me?
- I didn't follow you.</b>

372
00:27:57,490 --> 00:27:59,329
<b>I was thinking about something.</b>

373
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:01,160
<b>Okay.</b>

374
00:28:11,869 --> 00:28:12,940
<b>- Why...
- Why...</b>

375
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:14,910
<b>Why me?</b>

376
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,450
<b>Why did I have to fall for
a guy like a cat?</b>

377
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:29,089
<b>- Hey, Sol Ah.
- Hey.</b>

378
00:28:30,329 --> 00:28:31,890
<b>- Well...
- What is it?</b>

379
00:28:32,289 --> 00:28:35,529
<b>Is someone with you right now?</b>

380
00:28:37,269 --> 00:28:38,329
<b>The part-timer.</b>

381
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:41,500
<b>He's there?</b>

382
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:46,085
<b>Is it because you don't want anyone
to hear what you're about to say?</b>

383
00:28:46,109 --> 00:28:47,740
<b>No, it's nothing. Bye.</b>

384
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,680
<b>Sol Ah?</b>

385
00:28:56,619 --> 00:28:58,619
<b>- What is it this time?
- Are you alone?</b>

386
00:29:00,119 --> 00:29:01,160
<b>I'm with the part-timer.</b>

387
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:02,960
<b>I see.</b>

388
00:29:04,029 --> 00:29:06,390
<b>Is everything okay?</b>

389
00:29:07,099 --> 00:29:08,805
<b>Yes, everything's okay.</b>

390
00:29:08,829 --> 00:29:10,529
<b>- But why...
- I'll hang up then.</b>

391
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:21,539
<b>- Are you looking for Bang Guk Bong?
- What?</b>

392
00:29:22,839 --> 00:29:24,480
<b>- No.
- Should I put him on the phone?</b>

393
00:29:25,349 --> 00:29:26,349
<b>No.</b>

394
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:29,549
<b>I can't put him on the phone
even if you want to talk to him.</b>

395
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:32,019
<b>He's not here.</b>

396
00:29:33,089 --> 00:29:34,859
<b>- Where did he go?
- I don't know.</b>

397
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:37,960
<b>Maybe he went to
the Uyuni Salt Flat in Bolivia.</b>

398
00:29:38,329 --> 00:29:39,359
<b>What?</b>

399
00:29:46,599 --> 00:29:47,869
<b>He's really not here.</b>

400
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:51,140
<b>- You got off work early.
- Yes.</b>

401
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:53,109
<b>Have a seat. Do you want coffee?</b>

402
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:56,039
<b>No, I just dropped by.</b>

403
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,480
<b>By the way,</b>

404
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:00,349
<b>where's Bang Guk Bong?</b>

405
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:03,549
<b>Did he really go on a trip?</b>

406
00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:08,119
<b>Does he make you that nervous?</b>

407
00:30:08,359 --> 00:30:09,990
<b>What? Me?</b>

408
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:12,559
<b>- What are you talking about?
- You're nervous...</b>

409
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:14,630
<b>that he might disappear again.</b>

410
00:30:16,430 --> 00:30:17,829
<b>Just like me.</b>

411
00:30:34,579 --> 00:30:35,680
<b>What's that?</b>

412
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:38,050
<b>He searched all over the place
to buy peaches.</b>

413
00:30:38,849 --> 00:30:39,920
<b>Peaches?</b>

414
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:42,890
<b>(Sliced peaches)</b>

415
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:46,359
<b>My mom used to love peaches.</b>

416
00:30:48,259 --> 00:30:50,400
<b>She passed away in the winter,</b>

417
00:30:50,730 --> 00:30:52,700
<b>so I can't give her peaches.</b>

418
00:30:54,339 --> 00:30:55,739
<b>He got this because of what I said?</b>

419
00:30:57,269 --> 00:30:59,345
<b>He couldn't show up because
he was trying to buy peaches?</b>

420
00:30:59,369 --> 00:31:00,980
<b>Of all the people, how could you...</b>

421
00:31:04,579 --> 00:31:06,049
<b>Why does it have to be him?</b>

422
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:12,019
<b>I told you I'll be your friend
if you ever find someone new.</b>

423
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:14,890
<b>But not him. I don't approve of him.</b>

424
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:19,505
<b>I'm only giving this to you
because I can't stand...</b>

425
00:31:19,529 --> 00:31:21,289
<b>seeing you so nervous
because of another guy.</b>

426
00:31:28,339 --> 00:31:30,000
<b>(Sliced peaches)</b>

427
00:32:02,769 --> 00:32:03,799
<b>Welcome home.</b>

428
00:32:05,869 --> 00:32:07,380
<b>You didn't...</b>

429
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,309
<b>disappear.</b>

430
00:32:15,389 --> 00:32:16,720
<b>(Episode 14)</b>

431
00:32:21,259 --> 00:32:23,630
<b>I guess not all cats are the same.</b>

432
00:32:24,699 --> 00:32:27,769
<b>You should've said you couldn't come
because you looked for peaches.</b>

433
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:31,609
<b>You can't get peaches in the winter.</b>

434
00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:34,010
<b>Why not just come if all you had
were canned peaches?</b>

435
00:32:36,879 --> 00:32:38,355
<b>I fell asleep.</b>

436
00:32:38,379 --> 00:32:40,510
<b>You slept? Where?</b>

437
00:32:40,879 --> 00:32:43,379
<b>You didn't come home either.</b>

438
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:46,649
<b>In the street.</b>

439
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:49,060
<b>Before I knew it.</b>

440
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:54,265
<b>Do you have something
like narcolepsy?</b>

441
00:32:54,289 --> 00:32:57,359
<b>Can you not control
when you fall asleep?</b>

442
00:33:01,369 --> 00:33:02,539
<b>It's something like that.</b>

443
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:05,969
<b>Oh, I see.</b>

444
00:33:09,539 --> 00:33:10,710
<b>Thank you.</b>

445
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:13,380
<b>My mom will be pleased.</b>

446
00:33:17,479 --> 00:33:19,120
<b>They're just canned peaches.</b>

447
00:33:19,719 --> 00:33:20,920
<b>But they're tasty.</b>

448
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:55,859
<b>Hong Jo.</b>

449
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:57,620
<b>What?</b>

450
00:33:57,930 --> 00:34:00,129
<b>I should go to the animal clinic
and get Hong Jo.</b>

451
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:03,799
<b>Oh, no.</b>

452
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:08,400
<b>He's at home.</b>

453
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,439
<b>I brought him home.</b>

454
00:34:15,709 --> 00:34:17,379
<b>Hong Jo.</b>

<b>Hong Jo.</b>

00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:25,919
<b>Is he upstairs?</b>

<b>Hong Jo.</b>

<b>Let's have a snack.</b>

459
00:34:42,669 --> 00:34:44,199
<b>Here you go.</b>

460
00:34:45,009 --> 00:34:46,110
<b>There.</b>

461
00:34:47,669 --> 00:34:49,310
<b>Did it hurt a lot?</b>

462
00:34:49,979 --> 00:34:52,750
<b>You're okay now. Eat all you want.</b>

463
00:35:00,919 --> 00:35:02,560
<b>Hello, Ms. Bang.</b>

464
00:35:04,090 --> 00:35:06,090
<b>Yes, I'm fine.</b>

465
00:35:06,159 --> 00:35:07,806
<b>Thanks to you, my mom's...</b>

466
00:35:07,830 --> 00:35:09,729
<b>It's only right that I take over.</b>

<b>My son left, didn't he?</b>

<b>No, not yet.</b>

469
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,870
<b>He's still there?</b>

470
00:35:18,909 --> 00:35:21,355
<b>He usually leaves right after
he unpacks... No.</b>

471
00:35:21,379 --> 00:35:24,750
<b>He just takes the same backpack
and sets off again.</b>

472
00:35:26,379 --> 00:35:27,756
<b>He must like it.</b>

473
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:29,750
<b>What? Me?</b>

474
00:35:29,819 --> 00:35:31,719
<b>That's impossible.</b>

475
00:35:31,919 --> 00:35:33,490
<b>Not that.</b>

476
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:36,689
<b>You seem to get along well
with my son.</b>

477
00:35:37,259 --> 00:35:40,259
<b>What's wrong?
Do you feel uncomfortable?</b>

478
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:43,376
<b>No, it's not really like that.</b>

479
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,430
<b>How strange.</b>

480
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:48,169
<b>Will my son finally settle down?</b>

481
00:35:49,069 --> 00:35:50,439
<b>The truth is,</b>

482
00:35:51,169 --> 00:35:53,669
<b>your father has changed a bit too.</b>

483
00:35:54,270 --> 00:35:58,110
<b>He started writing poems again.</b>

484
00:35:58,909 --> 00:36:00,349
<b>Did he really?</b>

485
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:02,379
<b>Thank you, Sol Ah.</b>

486
00:36:02,979 --> 00:36:04,889
<b>For being my family.</b>

487
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:07,419
<b>"Family"?</b>

488
00:36:10,159 --> 00:36:12,889
<b>Bang Guk Bong and I are family?</b>

489
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:17,360
<b>It's not like I'm going to
marry him.</b>

490
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:20,099
<b>We're not related by blood
or anything.</b>

491
00:36:21,439 --> 00:36:24,945
<b>He started writing poems again.</b>

492
00:36:24,969 --> 00:36:26,340
<b>No.</b>

493
00:36:27,879 --> 00:36:30,610
<b>Dad is finally happy again.</b>

494
00:36:38,889 --> 00:36:40,019
<b>Welcome home.</b>

495
00:36:41,459 --> 00:36:45,660
<b>It's just like having someone
at home waiting for me.</b>

496
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:49,399
<b>Isn't that okay?</b>

497
00:36:51,829 --> 00:36:53,769
<b>Oh, I don't know.</b>

498
00:37:03,339 --> 00:37:05,810
<b>Why do cats sleep for so long?</b>

499
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:07,586
<b>I don't know.</b>

500
00:37:07,610 --> 00:37:09,449
<b>I want to play with them.</b>

501
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:11,896
<b>I don't want to sleep either.</b>

502
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,589
<b>If I had a choice.</b>

503
00:37:15,819 --> 00:37:18,259
<b>Adults drink coffee.</b>

504
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,466
<b>Coffee?</b>

505
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:23,336
<b>My grandma can't sleep
a wink at night...</b>

506
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:25,170
<b>if she has just one cup of coffee.</b>

507
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,170
<b>Is that true?</b>

508
00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:30,970
<b>How long has Ji Eun
been away from work?</b>

509
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:34,370
<b>Is she so sick that she can't eat?</b>

510
00:37:36,139 --> 00:37:37,879
<b>Welcome.</b>

511
00:37:38,009 --> 00:37:39,750
<b>- I'll serve you right away.
- Thanks.</b>

512
00:37:41,649 --> 00:37:43,579
<b>You can sit over there.</b>

513
00:37:44,889 --> 00:37:46,290
<b>One meal, right?</b>

514
00:37:54,459 --> 00:37:56,076
<b>Is she the girl who lives upstairs?</b>

515
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:57,360
<b>Yes.</b>

516
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:01,346
<b>Is she sick?</b>

517
00:38:01,370 --> 00:38:02,899
<b>She always looked sick.</b>

518
00:38:04,339 --> 00:38:07,470
<b>She does look
a bit more withered than usual.</b>

519
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:11,055
<b>It's just a grilled mackerel...</b>

520
00:38:11,079 --> 00:38:13,886
<b>and she keeps sticking
her chopsticks in it.</b>

521
00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:16,920
<b>- I can't stand it.
- She'll hear you.</b>

522
00:38:17,079 --> 00:38:21,220
<b>That's how frustrated I am.</b>

523
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,589
<b>Mom, I'm hungry.</b>

524
00:38:26,259 --> 00:38:28,459
<b>- Sure.
- I was out and came for lunch.</b>

525
00:38:28,529 --> 00:38:29,860
<b>Sit down.</b>

526
00:38:38,269 --> 00:38:39,569
<b>You're eating?</b>

527
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:45,449
<b>You're... You're eating.</b>

528
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:47,625
<b>You're eating.</b>

529
00:38:47,649 --> 00:38:48,980
<b>Why are you eating?</b>

530
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:51,319
<b>What I mean is...</b>

531
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:56,165
<b>Why are you eating here?
This is my restaurant.</b>

532
00:38:56,189 --> 00:38:57,696
<b>Your restaurant?</b>

533
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:00,589
<b>Doo Sik, do you know
the sickly girl...</b>

534
00:39:00,990 --> 00:39:02,899
<b>Do you know the girl from upstairs?</b>

535
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:04,829
<b>What are you talking about?</b>

536
00:39:06,329 --> 00:39:07,769
<b>The girl from upstairs?</b>

537
00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:11,709
<b>They're his parents.</b>

538
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:16,779
<b>- Hey. Why is she running away?
- Wait.</b>

539
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:20,610
<b>You fool. What did you do?</b>

540
00:39:21,079 --> 00:39:22,480
<b>I did nothing!</b>

541
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:27,990
<b>Oh, my goodness.</b>

542
00:39:31,889 --> 00:39:34,490
<b>That was so humiliating.</b>

543
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:41,069
<b>Oh, no. I didn't pay.</b>

544
00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:43,839
<b>Hey. Who is she?</b>

545
00:39:44,639 --> 00:39:45,685
<b>It's a long story.</b>

546
00:39:45,709 --> 00:39:47,370
<b>Tell us. Who is she?</b>

547
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:49,156
<b>My high school art club friend.</b>

548
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:50,310
<b>A friend?</b>

549
00:39:50,810 --> 00:39:52,779
<b>But I don't remember her.</b>

550
00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:56,755
<b>It was the awkwardness.
That's why she ran away.</b>

551
00:39:56,779 --> 00:39:58,550
<b>She's my senior at work.</b>

552
00:39:58,889 --> 00:40:01,490
<b>What? She's your senior?</b>

553
00:40:01,689 --> 00:40:03,065
<b>Then why did she run away?</b>

554
00:40:03,089 --> 00:40:05,005
<b>You should've stopped her!</b>

555
00:40:05,029 --> 00:40:07,065
<b>I should've given her
some free food.</b>

556
00:40:07,089 --> 00:40:09,976
<b>Don't you know how to
brown-nose your seniors?</b>

557
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,276
<b>- You idiot.
- I'm not done explaining.</b>

558
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:13,769
<b>- There's more?
- What's more?</b>

559
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,500
<b>The eraser.</b>

560
00:40:18,870 --> 00:40:21,370
<b>A really heavy
and cumbersome eraser.</b>

<b>(Nalsaem Design)</b>

<b>You know how much
I hate heavy things.</b>

563
00:40:57,009 --> 00:40:58,250
<b>I'm scared of them.</b>

564
00:40:58,850 --> 00:41:02,320
<b>Oh, so Eun Ji Eun confessed.</b>

565
00:41:03,450 --> 00:41:04,966
<b>She actually has guts.</b>

566
00:41:04,990 --> 00:41:06,019
<b>Hey.</b>

567
00:41:06,289 --> 00:41:08,535
<b>You should've told me if you knew.</b>

568
00:41:08,559 --> 00:41:09,735
<b>What if I did?</b>

569
00:41:09,759 --> 00:41:11,535
<b>Then I wouldn't have charmed her.</b>

570
00:41:11,559 --> 00:41:13,289
<b>I'd have cautiously held back.</b>

571
00:41:14,289 --> 00:41:16,200
<b>Do you dislike her that much?</b>

572
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:18,230
<b>It's too burdensome.</b>

573
00:41:18,529 --> 00:41:21,000
<b>She kept my eraser for 10 years.</b>

574

<b>Do you think...</b>

575
00:41:23,769 --> 00:41:26,070
<b>she moved in upstairs on purpose?</b>

576

<b>She did. And she
got this job on purpose too.</b>

<b>Hey.</b>

578
00:41:29,879 --> 00:41:31,625
<b>If she knew it was
your parents' restaurant,</b>

<b>do you think she'd have
sat there to eat?</b>

580
00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:36,519
<b>And you started working here

581
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:37,919
<b>I guess so.</b>

<b>Yes.</b>

628
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:33,389
<b>But he was crying back then.</b>

629
00:44:34,059 --> 00:44:35,159
<b>He was crying?</b>

630
00:44:37,259 --> 00:44:40,870
<b>He cried so sorrowfully,
and it made me cry too.</b>

631
00:44:42,269 --> 00:44:44,470
<b>It seemed like he understood
how I felt.</b>

632
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:47,769
<b>You're right.</b>

633
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:50,179
<b>He is like that.</b>

634
00:44:51,279 --> 00:44:52,309
<b>I envy you.</b>

635
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:55,320
<b>Since he's that kind of guy.</b>

636
00:44:58,049 --> 00:44:59,190
<b>There's nothing to envy.</b>

637
00:45:00,450 --> 00:45:02,159
<b>I shouldn't like him.</b>

638
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:17,000
<b>Anyway, thanks for listening to me.</b>

639
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:19,370
<b>Actually,</b>

640
00:45:21,409 --> 00:45:23,240
<b>you came to listen to me, right?</b>

641
00:45:29,450 --> 00:45:31,450
<b>Did you hear about the eraser?</b>

642
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:34,350
<b>What do you mean...</b>

643
00:45:34,789 --> 00:45:35,889
<b>I know...</b>

644
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:38,529
<b>you even brought tteok-bokki
to make me feel better.</b>

645
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:52,110
<b>This is so spicy.</b>

646
00:45:53,269 --> 00:45:54,940
<b>This tteok-bokki is so spicy,
isn't it?</b>

647
00:45:55,279 --> 00:45:56,840
<b>It's really spicy.</b>

648
00:46:07,549 --> 00:46:08,860
<b>It's so spicy.</b>

649
00:46:09,620 --> 00:46:11,519
<b>Don't cry.</b>

650
00:46:12,230 --> 00:46:13,490
<b>It's just so spicy.</b>

651
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:37,379
<b>There's no need for me
to make this, is there?</b>

652
00:46:39,350 --> 00:46:41,590
<b>I already have
a gigantic cat tower here.</b>

653
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,176
<b>- Morning.
- Sol Ah.</b>

654
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:53,269
<b>Hello.</b>

655
00:46:54,299 --> 00:46:55,399
<b>Ji Eun came too?</b>

656
00:47:06,710 --> 00:47:08,179
<b>- Hello.
- Good morning.</b>

657
00:47:08,750 --> 00:47:11,519
<b>Ji Eun, you're back.
You have a lot of work to do.</b>

658
00:47:11,889 --> 00:47:14,450
<b>Get feedback from the client
and make changes.</b>

659
00:47:14,990 --> 00:47:16,019
<b>Yes, ma'am.</b>

660
00:47:19,429 --> 00:47:20,659
<b>Aren't you going to work?</b>

661
00:47:22,059 --> 00:47:24,230
<b>Hey, aren't you going to work?</b>

662
00:47:28,769 --> 00:47:29,940
<b>I am working.</b>

663
00:47:39,710 --> 00:47:41,309
<b>- It's a cat.
- How cute.</b>

664
00:47:41,809 --> 00:47:43,395
<b>Look at that cat.</b>

665
00:47:43,419 --> 00:47:44,726
<b>It's so cute.</b>

666
00:47:44,750 --> 00:47:46,096
<b>It's adorable.</b>

667
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:47,450
<b>- Hello.
- Let's take a picture.</b>

668
00:47:47,690 --> 00:47:49,566
<b>How pretty. How old are you?</b>

669
00:47:49,590 --> 00:47:50,735
<b>It's so cute.</b>

670
00:47:50,759 --> 00:47:52,990
<b>- Are you satisfied?
- You're doing a good job.</b>

671
00:47:56,730 --> 00:47:58,806
<b>- How old are you?
- How cute.</b>

672
00:47:58,830 --> 00:47:59,905
<b>- What's your name?
- It's adorable.</b>

673
00:47:59,929 --> 00:48:01,275
<b>- It looks like a doll.
- It's so pretty.</b>

674
00:48:01,299 --> 00:48:02,539
<b>Can I touch you?</b>

675
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:04,370
<b>- It's so cute.
- Hello.</b>

676
00:48:04,769 --> 00:48:06,110
<b>Oh, my goodness!</b>

677
00:48:16,519 --> 00:48:18,379
<b>Ji Eun, I'll send you
the final version.</b>

678
00:48:21,889 --> 00:48:23,919
<b>I sent it. Check it.</b>

679
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:25,789
<b>- I got it.
- Okay.</b>

680
00:48:29,230 --> 00:48:30,230
<b>I sent it.</b>

681
00:48:32,899 --> 00:48:34,429
<b>We're finished.</b>

682
00:48:42,539 --> 00:48:45,556
<b>We just sent you the revised draft.</b>

683
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:49,056
<b>Yes, that's why I'm calling.
It looks really nice.</b>

684
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:50,120
<b>She likes it.</b>

685
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:55,466
<b>By the way, can you change
the letters to a lighter color?</b>

686
00:48:55,490 --> 00:48:56,467
<b>Sure.</b>

687
00:48:56,491 --> 00:48:58,559
<b>And make the top drawing
a bit larger.</b>

688
00:48:59,860 --> 00:49:00,865
<b>Oh, that's...</b>

689
00:49:00,889 --> 00:49:03,799
<b>And I liked the font
from the previous version better.</b>

690
00:49:04,230 --> 00:49:05,230
<b>I see.</b>

691
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:09,039
<b>Okay, I understand.</b>

692
00:49:09,539 --> 00:49:12,110
<b>Then when can you send me
the revised version?</b>

693
00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:17,340
<b>We'll do it as quickly as possible.</b>

694
00:49:17,710 --> 00:49:19,226
<b>Give it to me. I'll talk to her.</b>

695
00:49:19,250 --> 00:49:20,309
<b>She hung up.</b>

696
00:49:25,390 --> 00:49:27,119
<b>You should know how to say no
at times.</b>

697
00:49:27,890 --> 00:49:30,565
<b>If you do everything she wants,
you'll just waste your time...</b>

698
00:49:30,589 --> 00:49:32,706
<b>and she will eventually say
she likes the first version better.</b>

699
00:49:32,730 --> 00:49:33,730
<b>Right.</b>

700
00:49:34,890 --> 00:49:37,759
<b>- Okay.
- Stop just saying okay like that.</b>

701
00:49:38,869 --> 00:49:39,900
<b>Okay.</b>

702
00:49:45,470 --> 00:49:47,809
<b>I need to get some fresh air.</b>

703
00:50:11,259 --> 00:50:12,430
<b>We've met again.</b>

704
00:50:13,029 --> 00:50:14,230
<b>I'm here to see Sol Ah.</b>

705
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:17,769
<b>She's working.</b>

706
00:50:18,339 --> 00:50:19,670
<b>Shall I call her for you?</b>

707
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:22,539
<b>I just want to see her alone.</b>

708
00:50:34,150 --> 00:50:35,319
<b>(Taekwondo Program)</b>

<b>Please sign up for our program.</b>

00:50:52,910 --> 00:50:54,109
<b>Please take this.</b>

711
00:51:05,950 --> 00:51:07,019
<b>Thank you.</b>

712
00:51:07,519 --> 00:51:11,619
<b>I'm sorry, but could you move
your foot?</b>

713
00:51:15,829 --> 00:51:16,829
<b>Over there.</b>

714
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:21,069
<b>Don't throw that away!</b>

715
00:51:26,410 --> 00:51:27,440
<b>Give it to me.</b>

716
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:29,640
<b>Why are you collecting these?</b>

717
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:33,109
<b>Still, this is my drawing.</b>

718
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:35,819
<b>Why is this your drawing?</b>

719
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:38,619
<b>All you did was draw
what others asked you...</b>

720
00:51:38,890 --> 00:51:40,289
<b>and revise it as they wanted.</b>

721
00:51:41,250 --> 00:51:42,789
<b>It's still my drawing.</b>

722
00:51:46,890 --> 00:51:49,059
<b>I even thought of working
somewhere else.</b>

723
00:51:50,759 --> 00:51:52,930
<b>Since I make you uncomfortable.</b>

724
00:51:54,829 --> 00:51:55,900
<b>But...</b>

725
00:51:56,970 --> 00:51:58,039
<b>Still...</b>

726
00:51:59,339 --> 00:52:01,069
<b>It's still my drawing.</b>

727
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:04,309
<b>I want to draw.</b>

728
00:52:05,579 --> 00:52:07,279
<b>So I'll keep drawing.</b>

729
00:52:09,380 --> 00:52:11,180
<b>Because I still like it.</b>

730
00:52:12,990 --> 00:52:14,819
<b>I'll keep liking it.</b>

731
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:19,960
<b>Drawing...</b>

732
00:52:21,259 --> 00:52:22,430
<b>or...</b>

733
00:52:29,170 --> 00:52:30,940
<b>You're really burdensome.</b>

734
00:52:38,539 --> 00:52:41,410
<b>Leave it. I'll...</b>

735
00:52:52,589 --> 00:52:53,789
<b>Hey.</b>

<b>Page 14.</b>

737
00:53:01,069 --> 00:53:02,700
<b>Revise it.</b>

738
00:53:06,839 --> 00:53:08,470
<b>I can't do that now.</b>

739
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:12,156
<b>Where are you going?</b>

740
00:53:12,180 --> 00:53:14,880
<b>To wash my face. I need to wake up.</b>

741
00:53:21,819 --> 00:53:24,835
<b>Oh, I saw him outside earlier.</b>

742
00:53:24,859 --> 00:53:27,029
<b>That... That...</b>

743
00:53:27,230 --> 00:53:29,660
<b>That guy.</b>

744
00:53:29,759 --> 00:53:30,936
<b>Bang Guk Bong?</b>

745
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:33,299
<b>Yes. He said he came to see you.</b>

746
00:53:33,470 --> 00:53:35,670
<b>Oh, did he?</b>

747
00:53:41,069 --> 00:53:42,609
<b>When was that?</b>

748
00:53:50,950 --> 00:53:53,920
<b>He sat here and cried?</b>

749
00:53:55,589 --> 00:53:57,690
<b>Why did he cry?</b>

750
00:54:21,779 --> 00:54:24,450
<b>You're there doing that again.</b>

751
00:54:30,289 --> 00:54:31,559
<b>Come on.</b>

752
00:54:32,660 --> 00:54:34,529
<b>Stand in front of me.</b>

753
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:40,869
<b>That way I can ask you to
sit next to me.</b>

754
00:54:42,539 --> 00:54:44,170
<b>I thought you'd feel uncomfortable.</b>

755
00:54:46,269 --> 00:54:48,269
<b>You can sleep at home tonight.</b>

756
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:50,279
<b>I'll move if you feel uncomfortable.</b>

757
00:54:53,180 --> 00:54:54,356
<b>Are you going somewhere?</b>

758
00:54:54,380 --> 00:54:55,779
<b>A place I like.</b>

759
00:54:57,349 --> 00:54:59,789
<b>That sounds like a nice place.</b>

760
00:54:59,849 --> 00:55:00,920
<b>With whom?</b>

761
00:55:00,950 --> 00:55:02,390
<b>Someone I like.</b>

762
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:04,119
<b>What?</b>

763
00:55:06,190 --> 00:55:09,730
<b>Oh... Oh, I see.</b>

764
00:55:11,059 --> 00:55:12,059
<b>Did you...</b>

765

<b>come here to say that?</b>

766
00:55:17,539 --> 00:55:18,539
<b>Hey.</b>

767
00:55:25,279 --> 00:55:26,809
<b>What was that about?</b>

768
00:55:27,710 --> 00:55:29,750
<b>He likes someone?</b>

769
00:55:39,390 --> 00:55:41,259
<b>He's really not home.</b>

770
00:55:55,069 --> 00:55:57,609
<b>I'll give you something tasty.
Give me a moment.</b>

771
00:56:09,359 --> 00:56:12,059
<b>Why does he have to be
Bang Guk Bong?</b>

772
00:56:13,089 --> 00:56:14,529
<b>Why is that?</b>

773
00:56:15,529 --> 00:56:17,099
<b>Not that again.</b>

774
00:56:21,170 --> 00:56:23,900
<b>Hong Jo. This is a secret.</b>

775
00:56:25,569 --> 00:56:28,140
<b>A secret you really
can't tell anyone.</b>

776
00:56:29,180 --> 00:56:30,779
<b>You know,</b>

777
00:56:31,279 --> 00:56:35,049
<b>I wish Bang Guk Bong
wasn't Bang Guk Bong.</b>

778
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:38,119
<b>She said she wanted me
to be Bang Guk Bong.</b>

779
00:56:38,849 --> 00:56:40,789
<b>If he weren't Bang Guk Bong,</b>

780
00:56:40,950 --> 00:56:43,619
<b>he could be anyone else
and that would be okay.</b>

781
00:56:44,589 --> 00:56:46,130
<b>Even a cat?</b>

782
00:56:47,289 --> 00:56:49,299
<b>I'd rather he were a cat.</b>

783
00:56:50,359 --> 00:56:54,670
<b>I can't like Bang Guk Bong.</b>

784
00:56:55,970 --> 00:56:58,745
<b>If Bang Guk Bong
weren't Bang Guk Bong,</b>

785
00:56:58,769 --> 00:57:01,769
<b>even if he likes someone else,
I'd still tell him I like him.</b>

786
00:57:03,710 --> 00:57:06,410
<b>I'd ask him to stay with me
and not leave.</b>

787
00:57:08,279 --> 00:57:10,119
<b>I'd say that to him.</b>

788
00:57:15,289 --> 00:57:17,160
<b>If Bang Guk Bong...</b>

789
00:57:18,190 --> 00:57:20,329
<b>weren't Bang Guk Bong...</b>

790
00:57:24,630 --> 00:57:27,400
<b>I would do this to him.</b>

791
00:57:29,740 --> 00:57:30,900
<b>This.</b>

792
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:36,309
<b>Hey. Hey.</b>

793
00:57:37,079 --> 00:57:38,880
<b>Where are you going, Hong Jo?</b>

794
00:57:40,380 --> 00:57:42,450
<b>That bratty cat.</b>

795
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:45,650
<b>Hong Jo.</b>

796
00:57:46,289 --> 00:57:48,990
<b>Where did he get to?</b>

797
00:57:49,190 --> 00:57:51,220
<b>Hong Jo.</b>

798
00:57:51,589 --> 00:57:53,690
<b>Hong Jo. My gosh!</b>

799
00:57:54,890 --> 00:57:57,130
<b>Hey. What are you doing up there?</b>

800
00:57:57,259 --> 00:57:58,660
<b>Do you want to join me?</b>

801
00:58:02,329 --> 00:58:03,440
<b>What?</b>

802
00:58:53,490 --> 00:58:55,349
<b>You said you were going
somewhere nice.</b>

803
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:58,160
<b>This is it.</b>

804
00:59:21,380 --> 00:59:22,779
<b>Who is the person...</b>

805
00:59:23,819 --> 00:59:25,150
<b>you like?</b>

806
00:59:35,059 --> 00:59:36,059
<b>Hey.</b>

807
00:59:37,059 --> 00:59:38,529
<b>Bang Guk Bong.</b>

808
00:59:39,670 --> 00:59:41,130
<b>I'm not Bang Guk Bong.</b>

809
00:59:42,099 --> 00:59:43,269
<b>Then who are you?</b>

810
00:59:50,940 --> 00:59:52,339
<b>Why am I blushing?</b>

811
00:59:54,910 --> 00:59:56,119
<b>Hong Jo.</b>

812
01:00:50,970 --> 01:00:53,839
<b>(Welcome)</b>

813
01:00:54,140 --> 01:00:56,055
<b>Sol Ah has eyes only for him.</b>

814
01:00:56,079 --> 01:00:57,056
<b>I want to be with you.</b>

815
01:00:57,080 --> 01:00:58,186
<b>Come somewhere with me.</b>

816
01:00:58,210 --> 01:01:00,785
<b>I first saw you somewhere near here.</b>

817
01:01:00,809 --> 01:01:02,555
<b>Why is your heart beating so fast?</b>

818
01:01:02,579 --> 01:01:05,196
<b>So what if you know?
Sol Ah doesn't know who you are.</b>

819
01:01:05,220 --> 01:01:06,626
<b>I'll tell her everything.</b>

820
01:01:06,650 --> 01:01:08,325
<b>Don't you ever tell her.</b>

821
01:01:08,349 --> 01:01:10,366
<b>Sol Ah will be left alone?</b>

822
01:01:10,390 --> 01:01:11,565
<b>That's how it ends.</b>

823
01:01:11,589 --> 01:01:13,559
<b>Without saying a word, just leave.</b>

824
01:01:13,730 --> 01:01:14,735
<b>I want to see her.</b>

825
01:01:14,759 --> 01:01:16,775
<b>- You're so cold.
- I waited for you.</b>

826
01:01:16,799 --> 01:01:18,136
<b>There's not much time left.</b>

827
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:19,775
<b>Can't I stay a little longer?</b>

828
01:01:19,799 --> 01:01:21,829
<b>Let's stay together
just one more day.</b>
