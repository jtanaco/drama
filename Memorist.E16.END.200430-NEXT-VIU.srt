there's this.

7
00:00:40,173 --> 00:00:43,474
It seems like Yoo Ah Young sent a parcel to a friend before dying.

8
00:00:43,944 --> 00:00:47,984
Her doctor and psychiatrist suddenly dying makes sense...

What a load of crap.

42
00:03:23,744 --> 00:03:26,344
Although, the last memory you have of this place...

43
00:03:27,714 --> 00:03:29,543

00:14:52,223 --> 00:14:54,534
This is my testimony...

170
00:14:54,534 --> 00:14:57,693
- Ju Ho. I said not to go in. - and dying message.

171
00:15:00,104 --> 00:15:01,904
On February 9, 2000,

172
00:15:03,874 --> 00:15:06,404
on a hill just outside of Shimbae,

173
00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:10,244
Bang Joon Seok, So Phillip, and eight others...

174
00:15:11,683 --> 00:15:13,784
raped me viciously.

175
00:15:15,654 --> 00:15:17,614
The police officer Chun Ki Soo...

176
00:15:20,354 --> 00:15:21,553
harassed me.

177
00:15:22,624 --> 00:15:23,994
Who are you?

178
00:15:24,593 --> 00:15:25,864
Mommy!

179
00:15:27,624 --> 00:15:28,734
Mommy!

180
00:15:41,813 --> 00:15:44,414
What is this place? Why is it so dirty?

181
00:15:44,614 --> 00:15:45,744
- Gosh. - Hey.

182
00:15:46,384 --> 00:15:48,953
- What could there be here? - I removed all of their memories...

183
00:15:49,213 --> 00:15:50,953
- and left them only fear. - Let's just go.

184
00:15:58,293 --> 00:15:59,693
Mommy...

185
00:16:00,624 --> 00:16:02,134
Mommy!

186
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:10,904
Mom.

187
00:16:15,014 --> 00:16:16,414
Why...

188
00:16:20,014 --> 00:16:21,014
Let him go.

189
00:17:37,693 --> 00:17:38,763
Ju Ho.

190
00:17:40,223 --> 00:17:41,334
Ju Ran.

191
00:17:45,003 --> 00:17:47,233
Why are you here?

192
00:17:47,804 --> 00:17:51,644
Ju Ran, Mommy...

193
00:18:26,544 --> 00:18:27,604
Ju Ho.

194
00:18:28,414 --> 00:18:29,574
Go...

195
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:32,513
Go to Mr. Eun Gon's house.

196
00:18:34,114 --> 00:18:36,354
I'll be right there, okay?

197
00:19:29,404 --> 00:19:32,743
The one who erased your memories of that night...

198
00:19:34,044 --> 00:19:35,114
was you.

199
00:19:49,223 --> 00:19:51,394
You have the same abilities I do.

200
00:19:53,493 --> 00:19:55,993
You can read memories, erase them,

201
00:19:57,193 --> 00:19:59,033
and manipulate them as you please.

202
00:20:00,433 --> 00:20:02,173
It's an incredible ability.

203
00:20:19,824 --> 00:20:21,953
We've located Sung Ju Ran.

204
00:20:22,723 --> 00:20:26,763
So you've been keeping her in custody ever since then?

205
00:20:27,463 --> 00:20:28,564
What do you mean?

206
00:20:29,733 --> 00:20:31,164
It was more like a cooperation.

207
00:20:35,203 --> 00:20:36,673
Sung Ju Ran knew...

208
00:20:37,074 --> 00:20:39,243
that killing them wasn't enough...

209
00:20:40,074 --> 00:20:41,473
to take revenge.

210
00:20:44,414 --> 00:20:45,983
Because of our powers,

211
00:20:46,584 --> 00:20:48,414
we went through things we never had to go through.

212
00:20:50,384 --> 00:20:51,983
What's the point of having supernatural powers...

213
00:20:53,054 --> 00:20:55,054
when we can't even use it to achieve justice?

214
00:20:58,923 --> 00:21:00,894
If we can't punish the bad guys,

215
00:21:02,733 --> 00:21:04,693
what's the point of having these powers?

216
00:21:22,253 --> 00:21:24,513
Humans are weak.

217
00:21:26,283 --> 00:21:27,923
That's why they invented the law.

218
00:21:30,453 --> 00:21:34,064
They thought it would help them achieve justice.

219
00:21:36,334 --> 00:21:38,233
But you saw...

220
00:21:39,164 --> 00:21:40,263
how the law is used.

221
00:21:40,564 --> 00:21:42,233
It only helps those who have power.

222
00:21:44,733 --> 00:21:45,804
We don't need...

223
00:21:47,743 --> 00:21:49,743
to rely on something so useless.

224
00:21:51,144 --> 00:21:52,243
Don't you agree?

225
00:22:06,263 --> 00:22:07,324
You do it.

226
00:22:22,914 --> 00:22:23,973
No.

227
00:22:25,983 --> 00:22:27,084
I won't.

228
00:22:31,414 --> 00:22:33,223
Just because I fight against scumbags...

229
00:22:34,483 --> 00:22:35,993
doesn't mean I need to become one as well.

230
00:22:39,094 --> 00:22:41,993
Ju Ran, no...

231
00:22:43,664 --> 00:22:44,733
You're...

232
00:22:47,364 --> 00:22:48,473
wrong.

233
00:22:49,173 --> 00:22:51,644
You spent too much time reading the minds of monsters.

234
00:22:51,773 --> 00:22:53,473
And that turned you into a monster as well.

235
00:22:54,503 --> 00:22:57,273
You became a monster while fighting against them!

236
00:23:02,483 --> 00:23:05,283
You think I became a monster myself while fighting against monsters?

237
00:23:10,154 --> 00:23:11,723
Who do you think I fought against?

238
00:23:13,294 --> 00:23:14,564
What exactly is a monster?

239
00:23:15,693 --> 00:23:18,664
If I'm a monster, what does that make you?

240
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:22,834
If you think I'm a monster,

241
00:23:24,473 --> 00:23:26,144
just kill me.

242
00:23:34,384 --> 00:23:35,513
Kill me!

243
00:23:43,394 --> 00:23:44,554
No!

244
00:23:46,115 --> 00:23:47,244
Kill me!

245
00:23:50,085 --> 00:23:51,115
No!

246
00:24:05,664 --> 00:24:06,764
How far are you going to go?

247
00:24:07,264 --> 00:24:08,635
How can you do this?

248
00:24:09,905 --> 00:24:11,875
What made you become like this?

249
00:24:11,875 --> 00:24:13,105
Get to your senses!

250
00:24:14,474 --> 00:24:18,004
People like you are so weak.

251
00:24:19,075 --> 00:24:22,645
You can't do anything. You just suffer all the time.

252
00:24:22,645 --> 00:24:24,285
That's what makes me strong!

253
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:26,984
Protecting people...

254
00:24:28,254 --> 00:24:29,655
is what makes us strong.

255
00:24:31,355 --> 00:24:32,895
We need to endure it until the end...

256
00:24:34,224 --> 00:24:36,464
and make sure we don't get eaten up by their memories.

257
00:24:36,464 --> 00:24:37,524
1, 2, 3.

258
00:24:37,524 --> 00:24:40,434
- In a white canoe on a milky way - In a white canoe on a milky way

259
00:24:40,694 --> 00:24:42,764
- Far beyond the blue sky - Far beyond the blue sky

260
00:24:43,065 --> 00:24:45,405
- A cassia tree - A cassia tree

261
00:24:46,174 --> 00:24:47,605
Where did you learn this?

262
00:24:48,135 --> 00:24:49,274
Is that how you do it?

263
00:24:49,444 --> 00:24:50,504
He's good.

264
00:24:51,545 --> 00:24:52,645
What's that?

265
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:54,645
Is this it?

266
00:24:55,714 --> 00:24:56,984
My goodness, good job.

267
00:24:57,045 --> 00:24:58,484
Being able to remain as yourself...

268
00:24:59,514 --> 00:25:01,484
is what proves how strong you really are.

269
00:25:06,825 --> 00:25:08,254
My weak little brother.

270
00:25:19,335 --> 00:25:22,504
Let's say the person who survives is the strong one.

271
00:25:24,375 --> 00:25:25,444
Deal?

272
00:26:06,385 --> 00:26:09,385
Sung Ju Ran, it's over. Stop.

273
00:26:11,325 --> 00:26:12,395
"Stop"?

274
00:26:13,754 --> 00:26:14,825
Stop what?

275
00:26:15,694 --> 00:26:17,125
Stop what?

276
00:26:19,464 --> 00:26:22,734
I'm not going to let you use me anymore.

277
00:26:27,535 --> 00:26:28,645
No!

278
00:27:10,244 --> 00:27:11,315
This is really bad.

279
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:12,914
It's not a bad injury.

280
00:27:13,855 --> 00:27:14,984
She can live.

281
00:27:15,115 --> 00:27:16,585
The injury isn't the problem.

282
00:27:17,954 --> 00:27:21,655
She's very unstable just like you when you were hospitalized.

283
00:27:22,065 --> 00:27:24,194
No, it's even worse.

284
00:27:26,095 --> 00:27:27,734
She's dying.

285
00:27:28,535 --> 00:27:30,335
I'll explain from there.

286
00:27:31,204 --> 00:27:32,835
Will you please excuse us?

287
00:27:36,704 --> 00:27:38,375
I'll go check on the patient.

288
00:27:48,454 --> 00:27:50,754
The NIS has been in charge of supervising...

289
00:27:51,625 --> 00:27:54,155
both you and your sister.

290
00:27:57,024 --> 00:27:58,194
Let's just say we kept an eye on you.

291
00:27:58,565 --> 00:28:01,734
We were encountered with something...

292
00:28:01,734 --> 00:28:03,605
the whole world had never seen before.

293
00:28:04,065 --> 00:28:05,164
Get to the point.

294
00:28:07,234 --> 00:28:11,805
We kept your sister isolated for 20 years so we could protect her.

295
00:28:12,815 --> 00:28:15,385
Her health deteriorated every time she used her power.

296
00:28:15,984 --> 00:28:19,355
When she first came to our lab, her condition...

297
00:28:19,885 --> 00:28:21,014
was out of control.

298
00:28:21,414 --> 00:28:23,524
There wasn't anything we could do to protect her.

299
00:28:24,855 --> 00:28:27,694
She was already in a serious state before things got this worse.

300
00:28:27,795 --> 00:28:29,065
She's in her worst condition.

301
00:28:31,095 --> 00:28:35,734
We can't be sure you'll experience the same thing she did.

302
00:28:35,905 --> 00:28:37,105
So...

303
00:28:38,105 --> 00:28:40,375
we'd like to protect you...

304
00:28:40,375 --> 00:28:43,575
My sister and I never asked for your protection.

305
00:28:43,645 --> 00:28:45,045
We're not this country's assets...

306
00:28:45,914 --> 00:28:47,244
or monkeys in a zoo.

307
00:28:48,914 --> 00:28:50,115
Let's negotiate.

308
00:28:51,545 --> 00:28:54,855
I'll erase all the records regarding your sister.

309
00:28:55,555 --> 00:28:57,724
"Negotiate"? No.

310
00:28:58,085 --> 00:28:59,355
I'm going to blackmail you.

311
00:29:00,194 --> 00:29:03,964
I've had a lot of physical contact with the NIS agents. Especially you.

312
00:29:04,924 --> 00:29:07,135
Everyone around the world have their eyes on me.

313
00:29:07,464 --> 00:29:08,734
What a great timing.

314
00:29:11,635 --> 00:29:13,004
I'm guessing...

315
00:29:13,875 --> 00:29:18,045
you want us to erase all our records regarding you and your sister.

316
00:29:20,615 --> 00:29:23,615
That is above my paygrade.

317
00:29:25,244 --> 00:29:27,754
I'll let your concerns be known though.

318
00:29:28,724 --> 00:29:30,285
Since you don't care for negotiations,

319
00:29:30,385 --> 00:29:32,924
let me blackmail you too.

320
00:29:34,724 --> 00:29:36,524
All the information you retrieved...

321
00:29:36,895 --> 00:29:39,065
must be taken to the grave regardless of what that may be.

322
00:29:40,164 --> 00:29:43,704
Disclosing any of that information will put you in trouble...

323
00:29:43,704 --> 00:29:44,934
on a national scale.

324
00:29:47,335 --> 00:29:49,174
I don't trust a word you say,

325
00:29:50,145 --> 00:29:51,645
but I'll try.

326
00:29:53,214 --> 00:29:54,674
See? I told you this was a negotiation.

327
00:29:55,815 --> 00:29:58,855
Then I'll uphold my end of the deal and get out of your sight.

328
00:30:10,224 --> 00:30:12,464
The national petition moved the National Assembly...

329
00:30:12,464 --> 00:30:14,535
and discussions of a special investigation...

330
00:30:14,535 --> 00:30:16,234
are being held.

331
00:30:16,865 --> 00:30:19,174
The fabricated investigation of the mass murder...

332
00:30:19,174 --> 00:30:22,174
at an abandoned warehouse in Shimbae City 20 years ago...

333
00:30:22,174 --> 00:30:25,045
was conducted by Deputy Chief Lee Shin Woong...

334
00:30:25,045 --> 00:30:26,974
and the prosecution is focusing on him.

335
00:30:27,444 --> 00:30:29,984
Back in 2000, Chun Ki Soo was bought off ...

336
00:30:29,984 --> 00:30:32,085
- by Deputy Chief Lee. - They're throwing me out?

337
00:30:32,085 --> 00:30:33,855
The prosecutors searched Chun Ki Soo's house...

338
00:30:33,855 --> 00:30:35,684
- and announced... - To save themselves?

339
00:30:35,684 --> 00:30:37,825
- to have claimed crucial evidence. - Dad?

340
00:30:38,224 --> 00:30:41,795
- The evidence is predicted... - Tell me they're wrong about you.

341
00:30:41,895 --> 00:30:44,164
to prove Deputy Chief Lee's crimes.

342
00:30:45,865 --> 00:30:48,095
When Moon Yong Dae came to find Yoo Ah Young,

343
00:30:48,095 --> 00:30:49,434
Bang Joon Seok beat him...

344
00:30:49,434 --> 00:30:51,365
with a square bar embedded with nails.

345
00:30:51,365 --> 00:30:53,835
He sprayed alcohol on him, made it catch fire,

346
00:30:53,835 --> 00:30:55,875
and had him drop off a cliff.

347
00:30:56,105 --> 00:30:59,645
In order to make his death look like a suicide,

348
00:30:59,645 --> 00:31:01,145
Hwang Pil Seon conspired with Deputy Chief Lee...

349
00:31:11,555 --> 00:31:12,555
Carry on.

350
00:31:17,395 --> 00:31:19,964
Deputy Chief Lee bought Chun Ki Soo off...

351
00:31:19,964 --> 00:31:21,694
and had him cover up Moon Yong Dae's case.

352
00:31:42,184 --> 00:31:44,254
Captain Koo, can you hear me?

353
00:31:45,254 --> 00:31:46,694
Just a second.

354
00:31:48,194 --> 00:31:50,125
Over here, the patient is awake!

355
00:31:53,194 --> 00:31:54,234
Se Hoon.

356
00:31:54,895 --> 00:31:56,234
Do you recognize me?

357
00:31:57,264 --> 00:31:59,504
Your wife just went to the convenience store.

358
00:32:02,674 --> 00:32:03,845
And Dong Baek?

359
00:32:04,974 --> 00:32:06,075
How is he?

360
00:32:07,845 --> 00:32:09,944
Right. Well...

361
00:32:11,385 --> 00:32:13,785
He's busy catching bad guys...

362
00:32:14,214 --> 00:32:15,355
like always.

363
00:32:54,194 --> 00:32:56,664
You're too sweet for your own good.

364
00:33:01,065 --> 00:33:02,164
Sister.

365
00:33:06,835 --> 00:33:08,405
It's been a while since you called me that.

366
00:33:12,944 --> 00:33:14,714
You used to be a sweet person too.

367
00:33:18,544 --> 00:33:21,615
I doubt you'll ever turn out like me though.

368
00:33:24,924 --> 00:33:25,995
Why...

369
00:33:26,955 --> 00:33:28,725
Why did you go to such lengths?

370
00:33:30,595 --> 00:33:32,064
Such lengths?

371
00:33:35,495 --> 00:33:38,234
Actually, I'm disappointed that I never...

372
00:33:38,765 --> 00:33:40,475
got to do more.

373
00:33:44,975 --> 00:33:47,915
You didn't have to kill everyone involved.

374
00:33:49,015 --> 00:33:51,115
Who would've done it in my place then?

375
00:33:53,214 --> 00:33:54,955
I'm still certain...

376
00:33:57,725 --> 00:34:00,325
that had I not done what I did,

377
00:34:01,825 --> 00:34:03,825
all those scumbags...

378
00:34:03,825 --> 00:34:06,265
would be living their lives in peace.

379
00:34:07,535 --> 00:34:08,635
But...

380
00:34:10,604 --> 00:34:12,674
you could've taken another approach.

381
00:34:16,044 --> 00:34:18,644
Yoo Ah Young left you her testimony...

382
00:34:19,544 --> 00:34:23,214
and you could've used your ability to reveal the truth.

383
00:34:24,444 --> 00:34:25,685
You...

384
00:34:28,115 --> 00:34:30,155
should've made a better choice.

385
00:34:34,794 --> 00:34:35,894
Ju Ho.

386
00:34:39,595 --> 00:34:41,535
Memories don't hold any power.

387
00:34:44,305 --> 00:34:45,935
People's memories...

388
00:34:47,405 --> 00:34:49,345
are powerless.

389
00:34:52,745 --> 00:34:54,314
Ah Young's memories...

390
00:34:56,885 --> 00:34:58,144
and mine...

391
00:35:00,385 --> 00:35:04,325
don't have the power to punish anyone.

392
00:35:09,024 --> 00:35:10,265
All right. You don't have to say more.

393
00:35:17,004 --> 00:35:19,334
Let me give you a memory...

394
00:35:21,174 --> 00:35:23,205
that'll help you make up your mind.

395
00:35:55,575 --> 00:35:56,905
Let me erase...

396
00:35:59,874 --> 00:36:01,345
all your terrible memories.

397
00:36:38,214 --> 00:36:39,314
The problem is this though.

398
00:36:39,314 --> 00:36:40,515
There's enough circumstantial evidence...

399
00:36:40,515 --> 00:36:42,524
to tie Bang Joon Seok to Moon Yong Dae's murder,

400
00:36:42,655 --> 00:36:44,524
but there's no definitive proof.

401
00:36:44,655 --> 00:36:45,725
He spent time abroad,

402
00:36:45,725 --> 00:36:46,894
so the statute of limitations hasn't expired yet,

403
00:36:46,955 --> 00:36:48,955
but we still won't be able to make an arrest.

404
00:36:49,265 --> 00:36:51,064
When did we ever let that hinder us?

405
00:36:51,325 --> 00:36:52,865
We should just do what we do best.

406
00:36:53,234 --> 00:36:55,595
What about Deputy Chief Lee then?

407
00:37:10,615 --> 00:37:12,685
First, arrest Kim Do Soo of the Intelligence Department.

408
00:37:13,084 --> 00:37:14,254
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

409
00:37:20,055 --> 00:37:21,894
I was thinking about going to see Deputy Chief Lee.

410
00:37:22,155 --> 00:37:23,225
Without a warrant?

411
00:37:23,225 --> 00:37:24,924
There's something I need from him first.

412
00:37:29,705 --> 00:37:31,334
I'd appreciate you still being polite though.

413
00:37:33,104 --> 00:37:34,174
I'm asking you.

414
00:37:36,075 --> 00:37:37,104
Got it.

415
00:37:41,475 --> 00:37:43,115
- Are you all right? - Yes.

416
00:37:46,584 --> 00:37:47,685
Mom, it hurts.

417
00:37:48,155 --> 00:37:49,555
- Honey? - Sure.

418
00:37:50,754 --> 00:37:51,984
There you go.

419
00:37:52,484 --> 00:37:53,555
Good.

420
00:37:55,325 --> 00:37:56,365
Here.

421
00:38:15,774 --> 00:38:18,714
I'm glad to see your son doing better.

422
00:38:25,124 --> 00:38:28,294
You came in for your first interview...

423
00:38:29,694 --> 00:38:31,464
when you around his age.

424
00:38:32,694 --> 00:38:33,694
That's right.

425
00:38:33,694 --> 00:38:36,604
Why did you decide this line of work though...

426
00:38:36,865 --> 00:38:38,004
instead of joining the prosecutors' office?

427
00:38:38,365 --> 00:38:40,205
You already asked me that during my interview.

428
00:38:43,604 --> 00:38:44,604
Did I?

429
00:38:46,615 --> 00:38:49,915
Well, I knew that prosecutors spent their days...

430
00:38:50,214 --> 00:38:51,345
going over case files at their desks.

431
00:38:53,385 --> 00:38:54,555
Right.

432
00:38:55,555 --> 00:38:58,924
Many weren't on board when we first hired you.

433
00:38:59,555 --> 00:39:01,424
It was custom to only hire those over 30...

434
00:39:01,424 --> 00:39:03,495
for special recruits who have passed the bar.

435
00:39:03,924 --> 00:39:06,964
I'm well aware that you advocated for me.

436
00:39:08,865 --> 00:39:10,234
In order to build a better system,

437
00:39:10,464 --> 00:39:12,064
customs should be broken from time to time.

438
00:39:14,705 --> 00:39:16,274
I'm grateful for everything.

439
00:39:19,314 --> 00:39:20,575
Has the warrant been issued?

440
00:39:21,075 --> 00:39:22,174
It will.

441
00:39:23,084 --> 00:39:24,845
Inspector Kim Do Soo confessed too.

442
00:39:27,655 --> 00:39:28,714
What's the charge?

443
00:39:29,484 --> 00:39:31,984
The statute of limitations expired for the Shimbae incident,

444
00:39:32,484 --> 00:39:35,754
but there are nine charges including abuse of power.

445
00:39:37,624 --> 00:39:40,394
The total sentence will be quite long.

446
00:39:42,734 --> 00:39:43,834
Don't be conceited.

447
00:39:45,365 --> 00:39:48,234
I won't go down that easily.

448
00:39:49,905 --> 00:39:51,104
I don't expect anything less.

449
00:39:55,015 --> 00:39:56,245
Superintendent Han.

450
00:39:57,484 --> 00:39:59,385
There must be a reason...

451
00:40:00,555 --> 00:40:02,115
why you came alone first.

452
00:40:05,285 --> 00:40:08,555
I came to ask you to make a decision that will protect...

453
00:40:09,055 --> 00:40:10,564
the reputation of the force.

454
00:40:12,734 --> 00:40:14,265
I'm dying anyway,

455
00:40:15,595 --> 00:40:18,334
so you want evidence to catch Hwang Pil Seon, is that it?

456
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:24,604
Sun Mi.

457
00:40:25,644 --> 00:40:28,374
When you reach out your hand to someone hanging off a cliff,

458
00:40:29,615 --> 00:40:31,214
you need to give that person hope.

459
00:40:32,785 --> 00:40:36,225
I don't see any hope in the hand...

460
00:40:37,084 --> 00:40:38,484
you're reaching out.

461
00:40:40,124 --> 00:40:41,354
Hope for my survival.

462
00:41:23,905 --> 00:41:25,064
Sir.

463
00:41:25,765 --> 00:41:27,935
We have a warrant.

464
00:41:33,774 --> 00:41:34,845
Shall we go?

465
00:41:46,055 --> 00:41:47,825
(214-12 Simpan-2-dong)

466
00:44:30,624 --> 00:44:32,955
Step aside. We're here to see Chairwoman Hwang Pil Seon.

467
00:44:34,655 --> 00:44:36,325
We said to step aside.

468
00:44:36,624 --> 00:44:37,865
- You can't go. - Get out.

469
00:44:37,865 --> 00:44:40,035
- We're the police! - Get out!

470
00:44:40,035 --> 00:44:41,234
Get out!

471
00:44:41,495 --> 00:44:43,205
- Get out! - Step back!

472
00:44:47,575 --> 00:44:48,575
Please step aside.

473
00:44:54,714 --> 00:44:57,544
Chairwoman Hwang Pil Seon, we're here to escort you.

474
00:44:59,345 --> 00:45:00,885
How dare you come here?

475
00:45:02,084 --> 00:45:03,584
- Attorney Im. - Yes, sir?

476
00:45:04,055 --> 00:45:05,655
Report that woman first. Right now!

477
00:45:09,794 --> 00:45:11,024
Superintendent Han.

478
00:45:11,464 --> 00:45:14,064
You're putting way too much faith in that telepathic lunatic.

479
00:45:14,165 --> 00:45:15,435
As you can see,

480
00:45:15,794 --> 00:45:19,104
she's extremely busy dealing with those who spread wild accusations.

481
00:45:19,504 --> 00:45:20,874
Including you...

482
00:45:23,845 --> 00:45:25,004
Chairwoman Hwang Pil Seon,

483
00:45:25,745 --> 00:45:28,615
you are under arrest for blackmail and murder-for-hire.

484
00:45:28,944 --> 00:45:31,185
Superintendent Han! How dare you...

485
00:45:32,285 --> 00:45:34,415
- Do you have a warrant? - Enough.

486
00:45:35,455 --> 00:45:37,185
Don't be rude.

487
00:45:37,754 --> 00:45:38,785
Yes, ma'am.

488
00:45:38,984 --> 00:45:41,825
Superintendent Han. Choose your words carefully here.

489
00:45:43,464 --> 00:45:46,225
That's how you must act in front of me.

490
00:45:50,834 --> 00:45:52,564
I'll say it again carefully.

491
00:45:54,405 --> 00:45:55,504
Hwang Pil Seon.

492
00:45:56,544 --> 00:46:00,174
You are under arrest for blackmail and murder-for-hire.

493
00:46:09,084 --> 00:46:11,754
That's fun. It is.

494
00:46:14,394 --> 00:46:16,924
Okay, then. Shall we go?

495
00:46:20,365 --> 00:46:22,935
Step back! You sewer rats.

496
00:46:24,604 --> 00:46:25,705
You have no class.

497
00:46:27,834 --> 00:46:29,805
You scum bags.

498
00:46:31,374 --> 00:46:33,714
- Call the prosecutor general. - Yes, sir.

499
00:46:37,285 --> 00:46:38,544
Madam.

500
00:46:47,754 --> 00:46:49,655
Superintendent Han. Where's Baek?

501
00:46:53,394 --> 00:46:54,464
Where did he go?

502
00:46:54,464 --> 00:46:55,694
Mr. Prosecutor General.

503
00:46:56,064 --> 00:46:57,665
Why was it so hard to reach you?

504
00:46:57,905 --> 00:46:59,405
What is going on here?

505
00:46:59,834 --> 00:47:01,834
How could you make the chairwoman come to the police station?

506
00:47:02,174 --> 00:47:05,104
There are national petitions regarding this. My hands were tied.

507
00:47:05,405 --> 00:47:06,874
Don't call me for a while.

508
00:47:07,274 --> 00:47:09,644
- Goodbye. - Sir. Sir!

509
00:47:12,915 --> 00:47:14,555
Darn it.

510
00:47:32,905 --> 00:47:34,035
What's this?

511
00:47:35,504 --> 00:47:38,874
Why is the criminal who should be interrogated, interrogating me?

512
00:47:40,115 --> 00:47:42,245
I heard the prosecutors named you,

513
00:47:42,475 --> 00:47:45,214
Deputy Chief Lee Shin Woong, as the prime suspect.

514
00:47:46,785 --> 00:47:49,515
I'm here to be interrogated as well...

515
00:47:50,484 --> 00:47:51,885
since I've committed so many crimes.

516
00:47:53,055 --> 00:47:54,155
Dad.

517
00:47:55,595 --> 00:47:57,495
I believe all of it is a lie.

518
00:47:59,794 --> 00:48:01,564
I will trust you until the end.

519
00:48:02,995 --> 00:48:06,365
Because you're a good cop.

520
00:48:08,674 --> 00:48:11,674
"The guilty shall pay for his crimes."

521
00:48:12,444 --> 00:48:15,475
I had forgotten for too long, but that was...

522
00:48:17,415 --> 00:48:18,944
my conviction.

523
00:48:21,484 --> 00:48:22,484
(Personal Data)

524
00:48:28,624 --> 00:48:30,095
(Personal Data of Bang Joon Seok, Im Joong Yeon, Hwang Pil Seon)

525
00:48:34,734 --> 00:48:35,765
You rat.

526
00:48:41,504 --> 00:48:42,504
Were you...

527
00:48:43,504 --> 00:48:46,975
always this fearless, Lee Shin Woong?

528
00:48:48,644 --> 00:48:50,885
Let me educate you again from the beginning.

529
00:48:51,845 --> 00:48:55,385
I won't be here for long.

530
00:49:06,794 --> 00:49:09,035
You don't have to stay here for long.

531
00:49:11,165 --> 00:49:12,635
We have ample evidence.

532
00:49:14,604 --> 00:49:15,604
Superintendent Han.

533
00:49:16,274 --> 00:49:17,874
The interrogation will be over soon.

534
00:49:22,174 --> 00:49:23,385
Hwang Pil Seon.

535
00:49:23,814 --> 00:49:25,915
Why don't we both guess how long...

536
00:49:26,584 --> 00:49:27,785
you'll end up in prison?

537
00:49:28,785 --> 00:49:31,055
You've been acting up for way too long.

538
00:49:32,254 --> 00:49:34,254
I guess you don't know me very well.

539
00:49:36,624 --> 00:49:39,064
I'll teach you a lesson so that you'll learn...

540
00:49:39,064 --> 00:49:40,535
not to cross me...

541
00:49:41,234 --> 00:49:42,635
ever again.

542
00:49:44,765 --> 00:49:47,674
What a pity. You should know that things have changed.

543
00:49:48,334 --> 00:49:50,374
A lot more people are like me these days.

544
00:49:57,285 --> 00:50:00,714
Let's talk about the stuff we can still charge you with.

545
00:50:14,765 --> 00:50:17,365
Sir, things aren't going as planned.

546
00:50:17,535 --> 00:50:18,604
What do you mean?

547
00:50:18,865 --> 00:50:20,905
The attorney general won't answer my calls.

548
00:50:20,905 --> 00:50:22,674
And I might get investigated as well.

549
00:50:22,834 --> 00:50:25,405
Why don't you try calling someone else?

550
00:50:26,174 --> 00:50:28,515
What about me? Am I in danger too?

551
00:50:30,214 --> 00:50:33,245
We need to get the chairwoman out of here in order to survive.

552
00:50:33,984 --> 00:50:35,785
- You should make some calls... - Get out of there.

553
00:50:36,785 --> 00:50:39,785
Pardon? But what about the chairwoman?

554
00:50:39,995 --> 00:50:43,055
I need to survive in order to save my mom. Get out of there.

555
00:50:54,734 --> 00:50:55,905
Assemblyman Bang.

556
00:50:57,705 --> 00:50:59,444
Where are you off to? I'm here to see you.

557
00:50:59,874 --> 00:51:01,774
- What do you want? - Baek!

558
00:51:05,615 --> 00:51:07,285
We don't have anything on him yet.

559
00:51:08,955 --> 00:51:10,455
Oh, you mean evidence?

560
00:51:25,405 --> 00:51:27,774
What about this? What does this have to do with me?

561
00:51:29,035 --> 00:51:31,205
Shut your mouth and watch. This is just the beginning.

562
00:51:35,415 --> 00:51:37,345
- She's so cute. - It's water.

563
00:51:38,285 --> 00:51:39,345
Drink up.

564
00:51:44,354 --> 00:51:45,424
Here.

565
00:51:46,254 --> 00:51:49,024
Do you know who I am?

566
00:51:49,754 --> 00:51:51,694
I'm Bang Joon Seok.

567
00:51:52,294 --> 00:51:54,495
I'm Bang Joon Seok, okay?

568
00:51:55,294 --> 00:51:56,365
Drink up.

569
00:51:58,504 --> 00:52:00,374
There's more, but I'll save it for later.

570
00:52:00,604 --> 00:52:02,004
I'm having a hard time watching this.

571
00:52:08,345 --> 00:52:11,745
Bang Joon Seok, you're under arrest for suspicions of murder.

572
00:52:11,845 --> 00:52:13,245
- Detective Oh. - Yes, sir.

573
00:52:13,285 --> 00:52:16,685
Take him where he belongs. I'll be right there.

574
00:52:18,185 --> 00:52:19,225
Let's go, sir.

575
00:52:20,155 --> 00:52:22,124
You have the right to an attorney...

576
00:52:22,124 --> 00:52:25,325
and can request a review regarding the legality of the arrest.

577
00:52:26,624 --> 00:52:27,665
Hey, you. Attorney.

578
00:52:31,135 --> 00:52:33,975
Look to your front. Over there.

579
00:52:34,035 --> 00:52:35,935
Are you crazy? Let me go!

580
00:52:36,435 --> 00:52:38,575
You're just a police. How are you going to deal with the consequences?

581
00:52:39,305 --> 00:52:41,415
Hey, stop filming me! Which broadcasting station are you from?

582
00:52:41,915 --> 00:52:44,615
Sir, is it true that you left a kidnapping victim to die...

583
00:52:44,745 --> 00:52:47,615
so you could cover up the former district attorney's scandal?

584
00:52:47,615 --> 00:52:48,984
What are you saying? Get that out of my face!

585
00:52:50,484 --> 00:52:51,825
Dong Baek, you punk.

586
00:52:52,924 --> 00:52:54,955
Sun Mi, don't you know me?

587
00:52:55,495 --> 00:52:57,564
Do you think you're all innocent?

588
00:52:58,064 --> 00:52:59,765
You just wait. You're all dead!

589
00:52:59,765 --> 00:53:02,435
Do you really think that would scare me?

590
00:53:03,365 --> 00:53:05,564
Get yourself a good attorney and wait for your turn.

591
00:53:07,274 --> 00:53:10,345
You're not that important, so you'll need to wait in line.

592
00:53:11,975 --> 00:53:13,044
Sir.

593
00:53:13,644 --> 00:53:15,944
Sir, will you please say something?

594
00:53:16,075 --> 00:53:18,144
- They're trying to frame me! - We want to hear what you think...

595
00:53:18,144 --> 00:53:19,285
as the former district attorney.

596
00:53:19,285 --> 00:53:21,185
Did you ever ask him to do something unjust...

597
00:53:21,185 --> 00:53:22,984
so you could cover up your scandal?

598
00:53:24,385 --> 00:53:25,424
No.

599
00:53:25,655 --> 00:53:28,024
Do you have any words for the family of the deceased?

600
00:53:28,254 --> 00:53:31,595
No, I don't really know what you're talking about.

601
00:53:33,124 --> 00:53:36,095
Hey, stop him. Stop him!

602
00:53:36,564 --> 00:53:39,365
I only helped him do what he did. He's the guy you're after!

603
00:53:39,604 --> 00:53:41,035
What are you all doing here?

604
00:53:42,104 --> 00:53:44,705
I have a lot to talk about with you guys.

605
00:53:45,144 --> 00:53:46,345
Take them upstairs.

606
00:53:46,604 --> 00:53:47,915
I'll be off now.

607
00:53:48,575 --> 00:53:51,245
Hey, what are you doing? How dare you?

608
00:53:51,615 --> 00:53:53,814
Don't you know who I am? Let me go.

609
00:53:53,814 --> 00:53:55,515
How polite of them.

610
00:53:56,155 --> 00:53:57,854
They gathered here before I could even call them.

611
00:53:58,124 --> 00:53:59,155
Hello, ma'am.

612
00:54:00,825 --> 00:54:02,124
It's nice to see you.

613
00:54:02,825 --> 00:54:04,624
The special prosecution starts today.

614
00:54:05,265 --> 00:54:07,765
There's not much left for you to do.

615
00:54:08,294 --> 00:54:10,564
I'm worried I might end up with all the work.

616
00:54:10,834 --> 00:54:13,135
Yes, if you're still willing to be a star prosecutor...

617
00:54:14,075 --> 00:54:15,174
like I promised before.

618
00:54:19,144 --> 00:54:21,975
Will you guys be quiet? This is a public place.

619
00:54:22,544 --> 00:54:24,544
Have some manners. You guys should know better.

620
00:54:24,885 --> 00:54:26,515
I can't believe this!

621
00:54:26,644 --> 00:54:28,455
You can't do this to me!

622
00:54:28,555 --> 00:54:30,785
You must've made up your mind...

623
00:54:31,124 --> 00:54:32,955
seeing that you're here.

624
00:54:34,024 --> 00:54:36,394
What? No, there was nothing to decide...

625
00:54:36,825 --> 00:54:38,225
because I never got swayed.

626
00:54:41,135 --> 00:54:43,265
Where did you find the evidence?

627
00:54:45,234 --> 00:54:47,334
Inside someone's memory.

628
00:54:54,044 --> 00:54:55,774
What are you doing with that rag?

629
00:54:56,274 --> 00:54:59,444
It's not a rag. It's a towel.

630
00:55:00,115 --> 00:55:01,814
I don't care if you washed it. It's still a rag.

631
00:55:01,814 --> 00:55:03,854
I made sure I washed it clean.

632
00:55:04,285 --> 00:55:05,354
Old man!

633
00:55:05,655 --> 00:55:07,194
Hey, you're here. Good work.

634
00:55:07,854 --> 00:55:10,495
Do you know how worried I was?

635
00:55:10,624 --> 00:55:12,564
Old Man!

636
00:55:14,794 --> 00:55:18,165
I'll live until I'm 100 if you don't stress me out.

637
00:55:18,165 --> 00:55:21,004
And will you take Se Hoon home? He cries so much. It's annoying.

638
00:55:22,374 --> 00:55:23,745
This is so upsetting.

639
00:55:23,944 --> 00:55:27,475
Do you know how hard I tried to take care of you? Forget it!

640
00:55:29,214 --> 00:55:30,644
Did you think I'd say that?

641
00:55:30,944 --> 00:55:33,685
- Old Man! - Old Man!

642
00:55:33,685 --> 00:55:36,385
- My Old Man! - I was so worried.

643
00:55:36,385 --> 00:55:38,854
I can't believe you're both doing this.

644
00:55:38,955 --> 00:55:41,424
Look at how swollen he is. What are we going to do?

645
00:55:41,424 --> 00:55:43,694
- It must've hurt so much. - He's always swollen.

646
00:55:44,294 --> 00:55:46,424
It's not because he's sick. It's just his fat.

647
00:55:46,694 --> 00:55:48,464
Did you think this through?

648
00:55:50,734 --> 00:55:52,504
I should've done this earlier.

649
00:55:53,464 --> 00:55:55,174
It's a very big loss for the police force...

650
00:55:55,535 --> 00:55:57,504
to lose a competent police officer like you.

651
00:56:05,845 --> 00:56:09,615
My job as a policewoman is over.

652
00:56:11,725 --> 00:56:14,294
(Resignation Letter)

653
00:56:24,234 --> 00:56:25,305
Good luck.

654
00:56:26,635 --> 00:56:27,905
Attorney Han Sun Mi.

655
00:56:29,905 --> 00:56:31,144
Thank you.

656
00:56:46,285 --> 00:56:48,495
It's a little sad to see you go.

657
00:56:48,924 --> 00:56:51,294
This country needs a person like you.

658
00:56:51,825 --> 00:56:53,464
- Right? - Of course.

659
00:56:53,894 --> 00:56:55,665
Can you not go?

660
00:56:56,194 --> 00:56:59,464
He's right. We all looked up to you so much.

661
00:57:04,345 --> 00:57:05,504
I sincerely thank everyone...

662
00:57:06,874 --> 00:57:09,774
for following my orders...

663
00:57:11,615 --> 00:57:13,185
even though I was young and arrogant.

664
00:57:19,185 --> 00:57:20,185
Here.

665
00:57:22,995 --> 00:57:25,624
Ms. Han, you did great.

666
00:57:28,135 --> 00:57:30,365
It was an honor to work with you!

667
00:57:31,564 --> 00:57:32,964
- Me too! - Me too!

668
00:57:44,544 --> 00:57:45,944
Thank you so much.

669
00:57:55,854 --> 00:57:56,924
You did great.

670
00:58:29,610 --> 00:58:31,610
You spilled some. Hold on.

671
00:58:35,079 --> 00:58:36,410
Here you go.

672
00:59:04,510 --> 00:59:06,379
Sang Ah?

673
00:59:10,110 --> 00:59:13,019
In Tae, do you remember me?

674
00:59:13,649 --> 00:59:15,090
Are your memories back?

675
00:59:16,749 --> 00:59:17,860
Yes.

676
00:59:18,890 --> 00:59:20,059
Hyeon Su...

677
00:59:21,289 --> 00:59:22,390
Hyeon Su.

678
00:59:23,530 --> 00:59:26,329
Mom, it was Mr. Dong Baek.

679
00:59:27,700 --> 00:59:29,470
Mr. Dong Baek?

680
00:59:32,570 --> 00:59:34,539
Don't be too relieved. I still need to keep an eye on you.

681
00:59:35,010 --> 00:59:37,910
I can't say you're out of the woods just yet.

682
00:59:38,110 --> 00:59:39,180
Especially with your sister and all.

683
00:59:39,180 --> 00:59:41,180
Just inform me of my test results.

684
00:59:49,390 --> 00:59:50,490
All right.

685
00:59:51,559 --> 00:59:54,289
I don't know why, but your unstable test results...

686
00:59:54,459 --> 00:59:56,760
have all gone back to being in the normal range.

687
00:59:58,229 --> 00:59:59,860
No matter how pleasing it is to hear,

688
00:59:59,860 --> 01:00:01,899
we can't blindly believe it unless we know the reason.

689
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:06,939
I think I know why.

690
01:00:07,809 --> 01:00:10,780
Gaining back the memories I blocked out 20 years ago...

691
01:00:11,209 --> 01:00:12,539
has brought me stability.

692
01:00:13,209 --> 01:00:15,579
I guess you can say I've been blocking my own abilities.

693
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:17,519
Tell me more about it.

694
01:00:17,820 --> 01:00:20,379
I need to know everything about you to...

695
01:00:21,249 --> 01:00:22,550
I can't.

696
01:00:23,019 --> 01:00:26,890
You of all people know how I can't explain in words...

697
01:00:27,729 --> 01:00:29,360
about everything that happened to me.

698
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:39,899
Chairwoman Hwang and former assemblyman Bang...

699
01:00:39,999 --> 01:00:42,570
who stood trial for murder, murder-for-hire, and bribery...

700
01:00:42,740 --> 01:00:45,780
were sentenced to 20 years and 18 years respectively...

701
01:00:45,780 --> 01:00:46,879
in their second trial.

702
01:00:47,140 --> 01:00:49,079
That is two years more than what they received...

703
01:00:49,079 --> 01:00:50,079
during the first trial.

704
01:00:50,479 --> 01:00:53,050
The prosecution also announced investigating...

705
01:00:53,050 --> 01:00:56,649
high-ranking officials linked with Hwang in the political...

706
01:00:57,019 --> 01:01:01,360
and economical circle as well as the press.

707
01:01:01,660 --> 01:01:03,789
Those who have been harming our society...

708
01:01:03,789 --> 01:01:05,360
with their illicit power...

709
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:07,430
and connections within these high-ranking officials...

710
01:01:07,430 --> 01:01:10,999
will face the ruling of the law once again.

711
01:01:11,269 --> 01:01:15,269
The public has never been this eager to ask for justice to be served.

712
01:01:15,769 --> 01:01:17,879
I'm Kang Ji Eun for OBC News.

713
01:01:22,249 --> 01:01:23,349
Get out!

714
01:01:24,820 --> 01:01:28,620
Why does the company even pay you?

715
01:01:28,950 --> 01:01:31,019
Go out there and find a story of your own...

716
01:01:31,019 --> 01:01:33,120
or make one, darn it!

717
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:34,959
Get moving!

718
01:02:00,079 --> 01:02:01,220
Mom...

719
01:02:05,419 --> 01:02:06,519
Mom.

720
01:02:47,160 --> 01:02:49,970
Inmate 1605, Hwang Pil Seon.

721
01:02:52,539 --> 01:02:55,709
Your son took his life last night.

722
01:04:01,669 --> 01:04:02,970
Hwang Pil Seon.

723
01:04:04,510 --> 01:04:06,709
You're even worse than your own mother.

724
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:09,979
You will die a brutal death.

725
01:04:11,379 --> 01:04:15,720
You will face the most pitiful death.

726
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:25,760
(Attorney Han Sun Mi)

727
01:04:27,769 --> 01:04:30,099
Plants and flowers keep coming in to congratulate you.

728
01:04:30,399 --> 01:04:31,499
Congratulations on opening your office.

729
01:04:31,999 --> 01:04:33,240
(Congratulations)

730
01:04:34,740 --> 01:04:35,910
I hope you don't regret this.

731
01:04:36,870 --> 01:04:38,479
Civil rights attorneys don't earn much.

732
01:04:39,209 --> 01:04:41,180
I won't be able to offer a big salary,

733
01:04:42,309 --> 01:04:43,510
so choose wisely.

734
01:04:43,510 --> 01:04:46,349
I will always choose to work with you.

735
01:04:54,559 --> 01:04:56,189
- Hello. - It's been a while.

736
01:04:56,559 --> 01:04:57,660
- Hi. - Good to see you.

737
01:04:59,459 --> 01:05:00,629
Superintendent Han...

738
01:05:00,629 --> 01:05:02,899
I mean, Attorney Han, congratulations.

739
01:05:03,169 --> 01:05:04,669
It's good to see you.

740
01:05:04,939 --> 01:05:06,640
I'm glad you're back on your feet.

741
01:05:06,700 --> 01:05:09,610
I may not have superpowers, but I'm as fit as the Hulk.

742
01:05:09,610 --> 01:05:11,110
Hulk, my foot.

743
01:05:11,110 --> 01:05:12,539
You almost died like a mere mortal.

744
01:05:17,110 --> 01:05:18,180
(Clean Toilet Paper)

745
01:05:21,220 --> 01:05:24,490
(Toilet Paper)

746
01:05:30,260 --> 01:05:32,800
This is why I said toilet paper was a bad idea!

747
01:05:34,430 --> 01:05:36,070
- Did you? - Yes!

748
01:05:42,539 --> 01:05:44,140
Congratulations!

749
01:05:44,140 --> 01:05:45,879
- Congratulations. - Gosh.

750
01:05:45,879 --> 01:05:47,280
It's good to see you all.

751
01:05:49,110 --> 01:05:50,349
- Congratulations. - How are you doing?

752
01:05:51,419 --> 01:05:53,579
- Congratulations. - Congratulations, ma'am.

753
01:05:54,220 --> 01:05:56,189
- Congratulations. - This Chinese place seems nice.

754
01:05:59,260 --> 01:06:00,519
Why don't we take a photo?

755
01:06:00,519 --> 01:06:01,860
I'll get us all in the frame.

756
01:06:01,860 --> 01:06:03,189
- Sure. - Sounds good.

757
01:06:03,390 --> 01:06:04,729
A photo? Seriously?

758
01:06:04,729 --> 01:06:06,160
Ms. Han, you stand in the middle.

759
01:06:07,360 --> 01:06:09,669
- Come on. - Gather around.

760
01:06:12,070 --> 01:06:14,669
- A little more to the right. - Good.

761
01:06:15,640 --> 01:06:16,740
Say, "Kimchi."

762
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:18,639
- Kimchi. - Kimchi.

763
01:06:30,349 --> 01:06:31,460
How pretty.

764
01:06:31,559 --> 01:06:32,589
- What are you doing? - What's taking so long?

765
01:06:32,589 --> 01:06:33,660
Are you done?

766
01:06:34,059 --> 01:06:35,990
- Did you take it? - How about another one?

767
01:06:37,089 --> 01:06:38,099
Together.

768
01:06:46,040 --> 01:06:48,710
- Let's take a look. - How fascinating.

769
01:06:49,769 --> 01:06:50,870
Nice.

770
01:06:52,210 --> 01:06:53,380
- What's that? - What on earth?

771
01:06:53,740 --> 01:06:56,549
Why did you only zoom in on Ms. Kang?

772
01:06:56,880 --> 01:06:58,349
- Look at you. - What?

773
01:06:59,049 --> 01:07:00,250
You should file a report against him.

774
01:07:00,750 --> 01:07:01,920
- Unbelievable. - Do you like her?

775
01:07:03,649 --> 01:07:04,990
Is there something going on between you two?

776
01:07:05,860 --> 01:07:07,490
- No... - We could try and make that happen.

777
01:07:10,589 --> 01:07:12,700
- Unbelievable. - Let me see.

778
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:14,200
Look!

779
01:07:15,670 --> 01:07:16,830
Isn't it fascinating?

780
01:07:17,229 --> 01:07:19,370
You look good even though you're in the back.

781
01:07:20,599 --> 01:07:21,639
I've been reflecting on myself.

782
01:07:22,170 --> 01:07:24,780
- I didn't ask. - That wasn't an answer either.

783
01:07:26,339 --> 01:07:28,380
So what have you done wrong this time?

784
01:07:29,309 --> 01:07:32,580
It's more about how I've been living all this time.

785
01:07:33,950 --> 01:07:35,490
Sounds like you did something terrible.

786
01:07:36,549 --> 01:07:37,589
Who's the victim?

787
01:07:40,689 --> 01:07:43,790
Tell me so I can protect his or her civil rights.

788
01:07:45,759 --> 01:07:47,700
All this time, I thought...

789
01:07:48,269 --> 01:07:50,570
I only had the ability to scan people's memories.

790
01:07:51,070 --> 01:07:52,570
But that's true.

791
01:07:53,870 --> 01:07:56,910
I don't think it was just their memories though.

792
01:07:59,910 --> 01:08:01,610
What they were thinking...

793
01:08:02,649 --> 01:08:03,910
and what they were feeling.

794
01:08:04,719 --> 01:08:05,849
Their time in general.

795
01:08:07,420 --> 01:08:09,320
I have been getting to know everything about them.

796
01:08:13,160 --> 01:08:15,990
I guess I only viewed my ability as a tool...

797
01:08:15,990 --> 01:08:18,559
which is why I read memories of so many random people.

798
01:08:19,429 --> 01:08:21,130
That's why I'm reflecting on myself.

799
01:08:23,530 --> 01:08:26,700
That is the most beautiful side of you that I've ever seen.

800
01:08:27,070 --> 01:08:28,110
I'm stunned.

801
01:08:28,240 --> 01:08:30,139
You're right. I stun myself too.

802
01:08:32,110 --> 01:08:34,410
So? You won't use it anymore?

803
01:08:34,710 --> 01:08:37,380
Of course, I'll use it. I'll use it well.

804
01:08:37,509 --> 01:08:39,580
I'll put in my feelings too and use it well.

805
01:08:43,219 --> 01:08:44,250
Detective Dong Baek.

806
01:08:49,790 --> 01:08:51,059
Thanks for everything.

807
01:08:57,370 --> 01:08:58,769
I look forward to working with you more,

808
01:09:03,540 --> 01:09:04,880
Superintendent Han Sun Mi.

809
01:09:16,389 --> 01:09:18,660
The National Assembly passed a telepathy law today...

810
01:09:18,660 --> 01:09:21,990
supported by a national petition signed by over 8 million people.

811
01:09:22,389 --> 01:09:24,830
The Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency stated that they will create...

812
01:09:24,830 --> 01:09:28,130
a telepathic investigation team to handle violent crimes...

813
01:09:28,130 --> 01:09:30,570
and will bring in Detective Dong Baek early on...

814
01:09:30,570 --> 01:09:33,500
to lead the way in protecting the people.

815
01:09:33,969 --> 01:09:37,570
The special law on telepathy passing appears to be an indication...

816
01:09:37,570 --> 01:09:40,809
that the safety and public welfare will be strengthened.

817
01:09:41,080 --> 01:09:43,049
With OBC News, this is Kang Ji Eun.

818
01:09:48,019 --> 01:09:49,019
I'm here.

819
01:10:09,439 --> 01:10:11,210
A hiker found her and called it in.

820
01:10:11,679 --> 01:10:13,839
We confirmed that she died two days ago.

821
01:10:14,139 --> 01:10:15,509
We need to wait for the autopsy,

822
01:10:15,509 --> 01:10:17,280
but the stab wound was the likely cause of death.

823
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:19,120
Did we identify her yet?

824
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:23,420
Shin Mi Young. Age 43. She's a housewife.

825
01:10:23,649 --> 01:10:25,420
Where's that punk Baek?

826
01:10:26,360 --> 01:10:27,759
- Who knows? - He thinks...

827
01:10:27,759 --> 01:10:29,630
he's the police commissioner or something.

828
01:10:29,759 --> 01:10:31,660
- Why isn't he at the scene? - Poof.

829
01:10:32,099 --> 01:10:33,759
The fame got to his head.

830
01:10:33,759 --> 01:10:35,170
Stop it before I kick you.

831
01:10:41,509 --> 01:10:42,570
Who is that?

832
01:10:43,410 --> 01:10:45,009
He's Shin Mi Young's husband.

833
01:10:45,110 --> 01:10:46,839
He returned today from a business trip abroad.

834
01:10:47,610 --> 01:10:48,780
Escort him down.

835
01:10:49,309 --> 01:10:50,380
Yes, sir.

836
01:10:53,820 --> 01:10:54,889
Mi Young.

837
01:10:55,519 --> 01:10:58,089
Sir, I'll escort you down.

838
01:10:58,360 --> 01:10:59,990
It's too hard to investigate if you...

839
01:10:59,990 --> 01:11:01,019
Detective Oh.

840
01:11:04,660 --> 01:11:08,130
I don't know what to say that may help console you.

841
01:11:08,769 --> 01:11:10,469
We'll catch the killer...

842
01:11:12,469 --> 01:11:14,439
I only cared about my job.

843
01:11:14,610 --> 01:11:16,639
I can't believe this happened right when I was gone.

844
01:11:25,580 --> 01:11:27,990
Give it a break, will you?

845
01:11:28,689 --> 01:11:29,719
Are you mad?

846
01:11:30,620 --> 01:11:32,719
Iryu-dong. Sungok Hotel, room 802.

847
01:11:32,860 --> 01:11:35,960
- What? - What else? The killer's there.

848
01:11:36,460 --> 01:11:39,630
You have to hurry. The flight takes off at 2:20pm...

849
01:11:41,330 --> 01:11:42,500
taking this man...

850
01:11:43,670 --> 01:11:44,839
and Kim Yoon Mi,

851
01:11:45,439 --> 01:11:47,670
his mistress, who conspired with him...

852
01:11:47,910 --> 01:11:49,139
and killed his poor wife.

853
01:11:50,969 --> 01:11:52,110
Do you have proof?

854
01:11:54,979 --> 01:11:56,349
The telepathic detective.

855
01:11:56,979 --> 01:11:59,120
Your reads have no weight as evidence!

856
01:11:59,979 --> 01:12:01,719
That's why the cops...

857
01:12:06,219 --> 01:12:09,330
Sorry, but I lose my temper when I see scum bags! Come here!

858
01:12:09,330 --> 01:12:10,429
Hey! Get over here!

859
01:12:10,429 --> 01:12:12,059
He deserves a beating.

860
01:12:12,059 --> 01:12:14,000
I can kiss an early retirement goodbye, right?

861
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,030
- I think so. - Why you little...

862
01:12:17,170 --> 01:12:18,899
Hold him.

863
01:12:18,899 --> 01:12:20,170
- Hey. - Get him.

864
01:12:20,170 --> 01:12:21,469
Let go.

865
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:27,179
- No. - Get over here!

866
01:12:46,599 --> 01:12:49,870
(Thank you for watching "Memorist")
