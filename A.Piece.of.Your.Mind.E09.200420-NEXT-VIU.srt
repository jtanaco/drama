1
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:50,570
It isn't the location,

2
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:55,010
and it isn't fatigue.

3
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:57,040
I think I fell asleep...

4
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,250
because someone stayed with me.

5
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:01,580
I want to see you.

6
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:05,590
No one will use that blanket,

7
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:07,920
so come whenever you want to sleep well.

8
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,030
Since I can't go to the semi-basement.

9
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,830
I can hear the thoughts in your head.

10
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:21,470
It is what you're thinking.

11
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:23,670
You're right.

12
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:33,350
(A Piece of Your Mind)

13
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,400
(Episode 9)

14
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,340
You haven't given up, have you?

15
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:00,970
Are you going to say silly things again?

16
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:03,540
Don't. I'm totally at peace right now.

17
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:06,210
Good, and you know why.

18
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:08,210
It's all because of these guys.

19
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,550
There's definitely a reason.

20
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:14,120
One day, out of the blue, you wake up...

21
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:17,320
and there are 100 reasons why you shouldn't like him.

22
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,760
- How did you... - Keep listening.

23
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:23,430
Kang In Wook and Han Seo Woo focus only on work...

24
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,570
even if they're alone in a dark place.

25
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:27,670
It's incomprehensible to others.

26
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:31,300
Whether nothing happens or something does happen,

27
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,610
there's definitely a reason.

28
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:34,470
Think about it.

29
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:37,110
You'll have one silly, simple,

30
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:40,350
and useless reason come to mind.

31
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,080
You'll be here, right?

32
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:48,020
Mr. Kang doesn't need me for his rehearsal.

33
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:49,390
Please stay with him.

34
00:02:57,530 --> 00:02:59,400
There has to be a reason.

35
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,870
I must put Ji Soo back in her place.

36
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:11,710
Mr. Kang.

37
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,150
I like your piece.

38
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,620
It's so good, that I hear it in my head before I fall asleep.

39
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:21,520
How did you write a piece like that?

40
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:23,420
If even someone like me likes it,

41
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:25,490
it means it's really good. Right?

42
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:27,290
Did you listen to it enough to have it stuck in your head?

43
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,630
It got stuck right away.

44
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:33,100
Do you mind if I listen here?

45
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,540
Suit yourself.

46
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,460
- Will you step aside a bit? - Pardon?

47
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:57,860
Okay.

48
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:02,660
You don't have to go that far.

49
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:04,660
Okay.

50
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:35,990
Oh my gosh.

51
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:40,260
I'm here because Soon Ho asked me to fix the blinds.

52
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:43,360
Did she send you too?

53
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:44,930
No, that's...

54
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:47,900
You could just say yes.

55
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:52,340
Tell me.

56
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:55,440
You don't have time to see me,

57
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,410
so why do you come to see my apartment?

58
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:02,520
What's the difference between seeing me and seeing my place?

59
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,190
Did you do it on purpose?

60
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:11,020
Stop and turn back, and look only briefly.

61
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:14,560
Yes.

62
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,630
You can't lie.

63
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,770
- That's... - We miss each other.

64
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:22,240
We want to be with each other.

65
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:27,610
We want to hold hands.

66
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,640
It's my first time having it be mutual.

67
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:40,920
That's just my case.

68
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,690
Are you going to stay? I'll leave.

69
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:46,690
No.

70
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:26,130
Soon Ho, are you still there?

71
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:34,670
How are the plants you took from my place?

72
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:36,440
They're well. You know me.

73
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:47,020
I thought they were the only things my wife left behind.

74
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:51,320
She left an unexpected way out...

75
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:54,990
for me to escape.

76
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:57,760
Playing this song,

77
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,270
I feel like I can breathe.

78
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:05,070
My wife...

79
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:11,010
is gone from this world.

80
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:36,800
I got the results from my physical.

81
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:41,540
What does it say? Nothing's wrong, right?

82
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,210
The doctor said...

83
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,320
he had never seen such a clean and transparent colon before.

84
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:55,320
When I heard that,

85
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,760
I wondered why I was so stressed.

86
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,190
I felt all my stresses melt away.

87
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:03,430
It really bugged me to see him...

88
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:05,560
every morning and evening after breaking up.

89
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:08,300
Most people don't see each other after breaking up,

90
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,870
but we do.

91
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:11,600
It has its perks.

92
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,040
People usually break up not to see each other.

93
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:17,080
Office romances. They keep seeing each other after breaking up too.

94
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,610
They don't cook breakfast for the other.

95
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:20,210
- Should I kick him out? - Yes.

96
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:22,110
Aren't you his friend?

97
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:23,380
It's hard on you.

98
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:25,080
Breakups are hard for everyone.

99
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,020
- Not Chang Sup. - Darn you.

100
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:29,720
Anyway, I'm good for now.

101
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,590
What about you?

102
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:35,700
Tell me 1 more among the 100 reasons.

103
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:39,400
Why all of a sudden?

104
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,670
You'd better have 100.

105
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:42,270
I'm going to hear all 100.

106
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:44,340
Well, he...

107
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,240
What was that?

108
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,280
Tell me the 100 reasons. Tell me.

109
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:52,140
You don't have 100, do you? Why are you lying, you brat?

110
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,450
Tell me the 100 reasons.

111
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,820
Tell me the 100 reasons.

112
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:00,750
The 100 reasons.

113
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,790
He kept telling me.

114
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:08,730
I need you, Seo Woo.

115
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,900
Stay with me.

116
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:14,170
To come. To stay with him.

117
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:16,270
- We miss each other. - That he misses me.

118
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:19,040
We want to be with each other. We want to hold hands.

119
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:22,010
It's my first time having it be mutual.

120
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,740
There's no reason why I shouldn't go.

121
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:30,150
This is clearly mutual.

122
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,270
- It's that thing. - That thing.

123
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:23,500
Take it.

124
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,230
It suddenly got cold.

125
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:50,100
That must be uncomfortable.

126
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:51,760
You'll strain your back and shoulders.

127
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:54,230
There's a way.

128
00:11:55,770 --> 00:12:00,510
Doing this improves circulation in my legs and helps me fall asleep.

129
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:02,360
How did you know?

130
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:05,060
I could feel you staring at me.

131
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:10,370
Did it snow?

132
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:21,380
It's spring snow.

133
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:24,350
Everything sounds pretty with the word "spring" in it.

134
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:27,790
Spring snow, spring night, spring ache.

135
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:30,590
Spring ache?

136
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:31,920
Yes.

137
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:36,460
When you get so lonely in the spring that your body aches.

138
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:41,000
It's not exactly a word, but Eun Joo and I made it up.

139
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,600
I woke up at the sound of snow.

140
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:48,810
You heard the snow fall?

141
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,280
You can't hear it in Seoul.

142
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:56,580
You barely hear it in the dead quiet countryside...

143
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:59,420
when snow piles up on crocks outside.

144
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:04,220
I hear it from time to time ever since I was 18.

145
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:45,130
That's fascinating.

146
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,640
It's my first recording today.

147
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:53,370
I'm doing the official recording.

148
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,280
It snowed in secret. It's a good sigh.

149
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,710
Keep sweeping.

150
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:32,580
Now.

151
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:36,680
That side too.

152
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,730
Oh, gosh.

153
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,970
Are you okay?

154
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:00,310
It's nothing.

155
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:03,740
I'm afraid I'm making you even more nervous.

156
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:05,740
Didn't you hurt your hand?

157
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:08,580
I rarely get hurt.

158
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,420
You're the one I'm worried about.

159
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,720
Do you think I can do a good job?

160
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,820
Of course.

161
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:18,020
How's the pianist's condition?

162
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,830
I tried my best to maximize it,

163
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:22,590
but he chose the piece yesterday.

164
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:24,860
It'll go well.

165
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:28,100
With Kang In Wook's skills, it'll be a piece of cake.

166
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:30,870
Give me some of your Midas touch.

167
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:47,420
Shall we begin?

168
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,090
Okay.

169
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,980
That one sounded good.

170
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:25,780
Let's go with that.

171
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:26,990
Okay.

172
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:36,430
You were great.

173
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:37,730
You too.

174
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:42,030
Thank you for making sure this song doesn't disappear.

175
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:48,470
I'll send you the file and discuss with you before I upload it.

176
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,710
If you want to play it for someone, do it beforehand.

177
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:53,550
There's no such person.

178
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:57,820
I'm really tired right now.

179
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:59,080
Oh, okay.

180
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:21,110
Well...

181
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:33,150
It's a happy day. What's with the long faces?

182
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,460
- Good work. - Good job.

183
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:47,700
- All right. - Here.

184
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:49,030
Thank you.

185
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:50,740
- Gosh. - It's delicious.

186
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,040
You're right.

187
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,370
- Is it good? - Yes.

188
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:57,180
He's good at making other delivery food,

189
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,140
but not fried chicken.

190
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:02,050
I'm always so sad at nights when I crave chicken and beer.

191
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:03,480
Our chef isn't that good...

192
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:06,590
at making fried chicken and Pyongyang cold noodles.

193
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:11,360
Our lab will be perfect if those two issues are resolved.

194
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:14,390
Didn't he say he could make cold noodles?

195
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:16,060
He just wings it.

196
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:19,970
The noodles become stiff if you use too much pressure.

197
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:22,530
But if you use too little, they get brittle.

198
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:26,040
The pressure has to be perfect to get the right chewiness.

199
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,640
But it's so difficult.

200
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,780
I should donate a noodle-making machine or something.

201
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:31,410
- I'm against it. - Thanks.

202
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,180
I've even thought of where to place it. Hey, wipe your mouth.

203
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:37,150
But it takes up too much space.

204
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:40,790
The pressure should be pumped... Hey.

205
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:43,760
There's a design in your shed.

206
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,460
It's still there.

207
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:47,360
You haven't gotten rid of it?

208
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:49,390
Hold up, hold up.

209
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,930
Okay, that's good.

210
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:56,670
Hey. I'm off starting today.

211
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,000
Cheers.

212
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,240
- Sure. - Cheers.

213
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:03,510
- Take some time to relax. - I will.

214
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,190
The plant you wanted...

215
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:21,290
is Seo Woo's, so I can't give you that one.

216
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:22,590
But here.

217
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,870
What is this?

218
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:30,300
I bought it a few days ago.

219
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:34,470
I wanted to use it today, but I don't think I should.

220
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:37,340
A few days ago...

221
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:41,410
Before you told me about your wife.

222
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:45,080
Today is a happy day.

223
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:47,420
You're allowed to use them today.

224
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:51,460
But that's just my opinion. It's up to you.

225
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,990
Jin Soo, breakfast!

226
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,530
Why is a chair missing?

227
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,930
Ms. Kim took it.

228
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:36,330
I see.

229
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:39,870
No.

230
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,740
What's with him?

231
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:49,650
This is the emergency key when I was in that room.

232
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:50,650
Why?

233
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:53,890
Well... You know. A rope from the ceiling.

234
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:55,150
It's a common method.

235
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:58,390
Like in crime dramas. An inn, ceiling, chair...

236
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:01,060
- Shouldn't you open the door? - What are you talking about?

237
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:04,130
This isn't an inn. Don't be ridiculous.

238
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:07,730
- Oh, no. What do I do? - I'll open it.

239
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:09,500
- The key. Hurry. - Oh, no.

240
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:10,840
Oh, no.

241
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,110
No!

242
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:26,050
Oh my gosh.

243
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:28,920
What did you write there?

244
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:32,120
How could I remember? It was so many years ago.

245
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:35,230
You're the girl who used to live in this room?

246
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:36,360
The college kid Min Jung?

247
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,000
Who are you calling a kid?

248
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:41,630
You were just in middle school. You rude punk.

249
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:44,970
You aged so much. You look completely different.

250
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,740
I thought you were older than I was when I first saw you.

251
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:53,380
She said I was a rich girl because I was inheriting this homestay.

252
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:55,850
You have no idea how frustrated I was.

253
00:24:55,850 --> 00:24:57,280
- I was right. - How so?

254
00:24:58,050 --> 00:25:00,550
You won't do anything rash, right?

255
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:03,490
- Why would I? - What is this?

256
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:05,460
You wrote a boy's name and erased it.

257
00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:07,390
Seo Joon Hee?

258
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:12,060
Yes, I remember. I was so silly back then.

259
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,600
There's another one. Cha... Cha Hyun Woo?

260
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,270
It was scratched out.

261
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,700
I should erase it if we broke up.

262
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:19,970
How many is that?

263
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:22,140
You should've erased it properly. This wasn't your ceiling.

264
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:23,240
I was popular.

265
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:27,350
"I'm so happy. It's exciting."

266
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:29,180
"Let's not forget today."

267
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:30,980
"May 2002."

268
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,750
- What day was that? - I don't know. I don't remember.

269
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,860
You said not to forget.

270
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:38,890
Whatever it was, it must have been exciting.

271
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:43,330
So that's where she was. The cheerful Min Jung.

272
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,070
Are you good?

273
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:50,640
If you add one more name there, it'll be the Big Dipper.

274
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:54,210
Welcome, college kid Min Jung,

275
00:25:57,210 --> 00:25:59,310
- Why did you gain so much weight? - What's your problem?

276
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:02,880
That perm was so not like you. This is more like you.

277
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:07,720
- Should I write "Chang Sup" there? - Seriously...

278
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:12,960
Hold on.

279
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,060
Once you hit this, the piece will be uploaded, right?

280
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,660
- Hold on. - Done.

281
00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:23,670
(Kang In Wook's "No. 1" has been registered)

282
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:36,580
(Han Seo Woo)

283
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:09,850
Mom, Dad.

284
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,890
I recorded this. It has been released too.

285
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:16,620
Isn't that so cool?

286
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:44,080
(I'm so happy. It's exciting.)

287
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,650
(Let's not forget today. May 2002)

288
00:27:56,690 --> 00:27:58,360
What did you think of the piece?

289
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:00,670
It was nice. You recorded it after all.

290
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:04,300
How should I congratulate you?

291
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,200
What will you do?

292
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,510
I've never thought about something like this before.

293
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:12,140
Seo Woo.

294
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:17,050
- You two... - So...

295
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:20,350
He records in the middle of the night. He's Before Dawn.

296
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:24,260
Before Dawn.

297
00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:26,320
Yes, hello.

298
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:28,660
I've heard a lot about you.

299
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:30,730
Do you know each other through work?

300
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:34,630
Well... I think there was confusion regarding when he had the studio.

301
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,500
Why don't you leave if you're done?

302
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:42,370
- Have a nice day. - You too.

303
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,040
But...

304
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:48,880
Be right back.

305
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:00,390
Why didn't you tell me you were close?

306
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:01,730
We're close.

307
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:07,270
Uncle.

308
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,440
Seo Woo.

309
00:29:16,910 --> 00:29:19,680
I wanted to congratulate you on your first recording,

310
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:23,210
so I did in a tangible way instead of just empty words.

311
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:25,380
Check your bank account.

312
00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:32,360
(You have received a payment from Moon Soon Ho.)

313
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,830
(Confirm)

314
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,270
(Transaction Details)

315
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:41,870
(Accept Payment)

316
00:29:42,670 --> 00:29:45,500
130 percent increase.

317
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:48,710
Gosh. You scared me.

318
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:50,040
Congratulations.

319
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:53,380
You're our main sound engineer. I leveled you up.

320
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:55,710
Thank you.

321
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:22,770
How did you make this?

322
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:25,140
The frying pan made it.

323
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:28,310
Congratulations.

324
00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:31,680
It has been an amazing day.

325
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:35,150
I was congratulated enough for a lifetime.

326
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,420
Can I really have everything?

327
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:41,160
Go on and eat.

328
00:30:56,570 --> 00:30:57,580
It's delicious.

329
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:06,920
You said...

330
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:10,590
you could hear the snow now and then.

331
00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:14,090
Since you were 18, was it?

332
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:16,890
Did something...

333
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:19,660
happen?

334
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,570
My mom...

335
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:33,950
I never talked about my mom,

336
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:36,450
so it's kind of hard.

337
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:42,420
It was a similar reason...

338
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,220
as your parents.

339
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:50,600
It was a blizzard.

340
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,870
That was all.

341
00:31:56,370 --> 00:31:57,770
But I couldn't...

342
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:02,540
accept that explanation...

343
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:05,110
no matter how much I thought about it.

344
00:32:34,670 --> 00:32:36,610
I kept waiting for it to snow.

345
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:40,550
To find...

346
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:45,380
a convincing explanation.

347
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:52,860
You said nature makes mistakes too, right? I had no idea.

348
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:02,900
Nature doesn't make mistakes.

349
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:07,210
That's just what I wanted to believe.

350
00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:11,240
So that's why...

351
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:15,250
you heard the snow ever since you were 18.

352
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:28,130
I feel bad. I ruined the mood on your special day.

353
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:42,610
When I woke up in the morning

354
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:50,150
And looked at the neatly made bed

355
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:58,560
I used to get this thought

356
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:04,360
What if I disappeared

357
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:10,740
If I were to disappear

358
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:18,180
As if I had never been here

359
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:23,650
To begin with

360
00:34:24,950 --> 00:34:29,420
If I keep living like this

361
00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:38,100
There will be a reason why

362
00:34:39,330 --> 00:34:44,500
I can't disappear

363
00:34:45,470 --> 00:34:49,110
If I keep living like this

364
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:53,950
A reason why

365
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:58,420
I can never disappear

366
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,680
(I got a raise)

367
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,550
I got a raise.

368
00:35:31,650 --> 00:35:34,490
I got you a red cardigan instead of red longjohns.

369
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:36,950
I'll pay 70 percent of rent now.

370
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:38,660
Make yourself pretty.

371
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:41,260
You'll realize what you want for yourself.

372
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:43,190
Do that for yourself, okay?

373
00:35:56,940 --> 00:36:00,680
What do I want for myself?

374
00:36:02,050 --> 00:36:03,710
Only I know?

375
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:08,150
Only I know.

376
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:20,530
Hey. My project was selected.

377
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:23,070
You know I've been working hard with ASMR.

378
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:26,240
Mine will be launched exclusively in an app.

379
00:36:32,210 --> 00:36:34,250
He used to love eggs.

380
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:36,850
I'm reminded of Cha Hyun Woo.

381
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:41,350
What about Seo Joon Hee?

382
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:43,050
He was younger than me.

383
00:36:49,930 --> 00:36:51,300
Do you need to go to the farm?

384
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:52,660
No, I don't.

385
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,130
That's where Hoon is. To clear his head for a couple of days.

386
00:36:56,370 --> 00:36:57,800
Doesn't he know I'm in Seoul?

387
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,200
Why is he telling me to...

388
00:36:59,770 --> 00:37:01,870
Hey. Tell him to clean the place while he's there.

389
00:37:01,870 --> 00:37:03,710
Tell him to take his things in the shed.

390
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,910
He says he can't open the shed.

391
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:07,040
You go.

392
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:08,680
Okay.

393
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:10,880
Do you need anything at the house?

394
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:13,950
Cash. That house needs cash.

395
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:19,890
Hi.

396
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,390
Ma'am.

397
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:25,260
Did you hurt your arm?

398
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:27,330
Yes, up to my elbow.

399
00:37:27,970 --> 00:37:29,730
I'm a bit flaky.

400
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:33,770
I won't be able to work for a short while.

401
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,410
But my last job was your debut.

402
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,110
So I'm very happy.

403
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:42,510
You should continue once it heals.

404
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:44,120
You and I are a team.

405
00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:46,720
I did great, didn't I?

406
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:50,290
Of course. Your tuning is a work of art.

407
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:53,490
You said you decided to work here...

408
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:56,460
so that you could cry in the studio.

409
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:59,000
It's the perfect place to cry.

410
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:02,430
Is this your first time here?

411
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:04,870
My friend asked me to meet here.

412
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,340
I'll wait outside.

413
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:08,970
How old are you?

414
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:11,340
I'm a senior.

415
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:13,080
That's a tough age.

416
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,710
But it's still the best, isn't it?

417
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:20,890
You lived with your parents.

418
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:25,220
When you woke up, your mom was in the kitchen.

419
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:30,760
At night, your dad came home from work.

420
00:38:31,330 --> 00:38:33,000
Your siblings lived all together.

421
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:52,950
It seems like a dream. I don't know how we all lived together.

422
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:02,260
My parents... There was a fire...

423
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:07,100
I'm okay most of the time, but now and then...

424
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:08,970
Excuse me.

425
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:11,300
Come inside.

426
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:28,050
Don't hold it in. You can cry in here.

427
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:10,760
It's such a good thing you went into this field.

428
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,330
You are really good.

429
00:40:13,430 --> 00:40:15,930
Did you come all the way here to tell me that?

430
00:40:15,930 --> 00:40:17,030
Naturally.

431
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,770
I wanted to compliment you.

432
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:39,460
Ji Soo, I wanted to say hi to you...

433
00:40:41,330 --> 00:40:44,190
in the place that you like...

434
00:40:46,330 --> 00:40:49,630
with the ambience that you like.

435
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:11,760
Ji Soo.

436
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,700
Ji Soo?

437
00:41:21,430 --> 00:41:22,900
Did it break?

438
00:41:23,930 --> 00:41:25,870
What broke?

439
00:41:30,370 --> 00:41:32,280
What is it? What broke?

440
00:41:40,850 --> 00:41:42,020
Are you alone?

441
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:43,750
Yes.

442
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:47,360
What is that?

443
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:49,060
Nothing.

444
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:53,030
I didn't know you were coming.

445
00:41:54,570 --> 00:41:56,470
- I'll go. - Were you...

446
00:41:58,270 --> 00:41:59,400
really alone?

447
00:42:02,210 --> 00:42:03,310
There's no one here.

448
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:08,910
Someone was here.

449
00:42:11,850 --> 00:42:13,080
Cash is the best.

450
00:42:13,650 --> 00:42:15,720
Retail therapy is the best therapy.

451
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:19,720
Hi, babies.

452
00:42:21,490 --> 00:42:22,930
Thanks, Uncle.

453
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:27,260
Oh, my. Mr. Kang.

454
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:29,330
I didn't know you came.

455
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:32,740
What's wrong?

456
00:42:37,010 --> 00:42:38,180
I must have lost my mind.

457
00:42:42,010 --> 00:42:43,180
I'm hearing things.

458
00:42:47,790 --> 00:42:52,060
A large company uses our studio too.

459
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:54,120
They're collecting voices or something.

460
00:42:54,590 --> 00:42:56,560
Anyway, that's what you heard.

461
00:42:58,630 --> 00:43:00,300
What company does that?

462
00:43:01,630 --> 00:43:02,800
It's confidential.

463
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,870
Anyway, it's nothing weird.

464
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:08,340
You're not crazy, okay?

465
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:19,980
To be honest, I hate listening to people's problems.

466
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:21,420
It's depressing.

467
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:24,890
But I'll make an exception just for you,

468
00:43:25,490 --> 00:43:26,720
so vent all you want.

469
00:43:51,350 --> 00:43:52,420
Kim Ji Soo.

470
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:53,720
(From Kim Ji Soo To Moon Jung Sook)

471
00:44:01,990 --> 00:44:03,030
Here.

472
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:09,400
Since you like it right before the sun sets.

473
00:44:10,530 --> 00:44:11,570
We're right on time.

474
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:27,350
Hoon.

475
00:44:28,890 --> 00:44:29,920
Hoon.

476
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:33,790
Why aren't you answering me? I brought food.

477
00:44:42,670 --> 00:44:44,230
Hey.

478
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:53,180
I'm doing well.

479
00:44:54,110 --> 00:44:57,710
My husband and I weren't accustomed to life in Seoul,

480
00:44:58,420 --> 00:45:02,390
but it's comforting knowing you're somewhere near.

481
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:05,020
I don't know anyone here.

482
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:07,660
Come to think of it,

483
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:10,960
I always live somewhere where I don't know anyone.

484
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:14,700
When I was in Oslo, I longed to be in Seoul,

485
00:45:15,230 --> 00:45:17,870
but in Seoul, I miss Oslo.

486
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:20,400
Especially at this time of year.

487
00:45:21,870 --> 00:45:24,440
The entire town was like a big Christmas tree.

488
00:45:25,910 --> 00:45:27,010
Merry Christmas.

489
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:30,810
December 24, 2019.

490
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:33,220
PS.

491
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:36,650
Please forget what I said...

492
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:38,660
in my previous letter.

493
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:46,660
- Hey. - Is this the previous letter?

494
00:45:47,330 --> 00:45:49,330
Yes. Well, that's not it.

495
00:45:50,770 --> 00:45:52,470
I'd like to see you.

496
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:55,470
Here is my number. Please call me.

497
00:45:55,910 --> 00:45:59,240
I feel like it'll all be okay if Won says it's okay.

498
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:01,980
Everything. All of it.

499
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:03,350
(I found out why Won's mom died. I'm tormented.)

500
00:46:03,350 --> 00:46:05,550
I found out why Won's mom died.

501
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:12,420
I'd like to see you.

502
00:46:12,690 --> 00:46:15,490
Here is my number. Please call me.

503
00:46:15,490 --> 00:46:19,030
I feel like it'll all be okay if Won says it's okay.

504
00:46:19,590 --> 00:46:21,630
Everything. All of it.

505
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:23,100
(I found out why Won's mom died. I'm tormented.)

506
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:25,270
I found out why Won's mom died.

507
00:46:28,570 --> 00:46:29,570
Hey.

508
00:46:32,870 --> 00:46:35,380
I looked through all of them.

509
00:46:35,380 --> 00:46:38,210
Like I said, I'm sure I was mistaken...

510
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:47,990
(From Kim Ji Soo)

511
00:47:13,510 --> 00:47:14,510
Ji Soo.

512
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:16,880
Guess where we are.

513
00:47:19,750 --> 00:47:21,860
I get the feeling it's the shipping address.

514
00:47:22,290 --> 00:47:23,290
Correct.

515
00:47:35,540 --> 00:47:37,700
I found out why Won's mom died.

516
00:47:38,370 --> 00:47:39,470
I'm tormented.

517
00:47:41,070 --> 00:47:44,140
Please call me, Ms. Moon. I'd like to see you.

518
00:47:44,140 --> 00:47:45,450
(Sincerely, Kim Ji Soo)

519
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:48,920
I feel relieved...

520
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:50,780
since you'll never read these.

521
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:55,520
I wanted to scream out loud somewhere.

522
00:47:58,890 --> 00:47:59,990
I miss...

523
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:02,160
Won.

524
00:48:06,330 --> 00:48:10,240
I feel like it'll all be okay if Won says it's okay.

525
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:11,870
(I feel like it'll all be okay if Won says it's okay)

526
00:48:11,870 --> 00:48:12,870
Everything.

527
00:48:14,070 --> 00:48:15,240
All of it.

528
00:48:16,110 --> 00:48:17,740
What I regret most...

529
00:48:20,610 --> 00:48:21,720
is telling her.

530
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:31,320
I collected videos of you from the past.

531
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:33,160
Videos?

532
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:34,790
Some are from your early 20s.

533
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:38,830
I'm going to make a personal homepage for you later.

534
00:48:39,630 --> 00:48:41,570
- Are you that happy? - Yes.

535
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:45,010
It's super hard to get selected for "Piano in April".

536
00:48:45,010 --> 00:48:46,740
It's your first time.

537
00:48:47,410 --> 00:48:48,440
I'm so happy.

538
00:48:53,580 --> 00:48:54,580
This is nice.

539
00:48:56,740 --> 00:48:58,620
You've worked hard.

540
00:48:58,850 --> 00:49:00,420
You had no connections.

541
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:02,160
You worked hard and made it on your own.

542
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:04,220
The world is acknowledging you.

543
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:08,160
Stop suffering inside now.

544
00:49:09,830 --> 00:49:10,930
Suffering?

545
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:17,770
This is nothing.

546
00:49:19,110 --> 00:49:20,870
This, which is lodged deep inside, is the problem.

547
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:24,580
What's that?

548
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:30,080
If I tell you,

549
00:49:31,590 --> 00:49:32,720
will you be understanding?

550
00:49:33,150 --> 00:49:34,250
Depends.

551
00:49:36,620 --> 00:49:37,690
I don't want to say.

552
00:49:38,890 --> 00:49:42,200
Tell me. I'm in a really good mood right now.

553
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:49,740
It's something that happened when I was young.

554
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:51,340
How young?

555
00:49:54,710 --> 00:49:56,110
When I lived in Norway.

556
00:49:56,810 --> 00:49:58,850
How bad could it be?

557
00:49:59,250 --> 00:50:00,880
As long as no one died.

558
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:02,050
What if someone did die?

559
00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:05,520
Look how shocked you are.

560
00:50:07,190 --> 00:50:08,590
I wasn't shocked.

561
00:50:11,090 --> 00:50:13,660
When we moved around in Europe,

562
00:50:14,890 --> 00:50:17,530
I avoided Koreans so that I could adapt.

563
00:50:19,130 --> 00:50:20,700
I was young and just didn't like it.

564
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:25,240
I never spoke Korean.

565
00:50:27,010 --> 00:50:29,640
There was a Korean boy that I hated.

566
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:31,880
Why did you hate him?

567
00:50:33,510 --> 00:50:34,510
No.

568
00:50:35,150 --> 00:50:37,750
That doesn't matter. Sure, you could hate him.

569
00:50:38,390 --> 00:50:39,390
So?

570
00:50:40,650 --> 00:50:42,160
Sure, I could hate him.

571
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:44,860
That doesn't matter.

572
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:50,200
Correct.

573
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:05,650
It was snowing.

574
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:07,250
Hard.

575
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:11,050
- Gosh, I'm sorry. - It's okay.

576
00:51:13,250 --> 00:51:15,260
Are you Korean?

577
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:18,390
You've been walking past here since two months ago, right?

578
00:51:18,430 --> 00:51:21,560
You didn't answer, so I didn't think you were Korean.

579
00:51:22,330 --> 00:51:24,330
Do you go to Eva Lawson High School?

580
00:51:25,430 --> 00:51:27,900
Everyone was taking shelter in the school,

581
00:51:28,970 --> 00:51:31,000
but before I knew it, I said...

582
00:51:35,210 --> 00:51:37,340
Ha Won is coming this way right now.

583
00:51:45,250 --> 00:51:46,390
So,

584
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:49,590
are you saying someone was in an accident because of a lie...

585
00:51:49,590 --> 00:51:51,520
you told when you were a kid?

586
00:51:54,530 --> 00:51:55,860
Why is that...

587
00:51:59,330 --> 00:52:01,030
You shouldn't have told me.

588
00:52:01,430 --> 00:52:04,440
This is nothing if you say it's nothing.

589
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:06,110
You shouldn't have told me.

590
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:08,040
It was just an accident.

591
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:10,740
Why can't you...

592
00:52:13,180 --> 00:52:14,950
If you'd just say it's okay...

593
00:52:14,950 --> 00:52:16,420
How is that okay?

594
00:52:16,420 --> 00:52:17,480
Ji Soo.

595
00:52:21,820 --> 00:52:24,290
You can't do this. Back then, I...

596
00:52:26,690 --> 00:52:27,930
Won...

597
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:30,800
How could you do that to Won?

598
00:52:32,830 --> 00:52:35,740
Ji Soo. Why can't you take my side?

599
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:37,500
Why?

600
00:52:39,140 --> 00:52:41,110
If you say it's okay,

601
00:52:41,110 --> 00:52:43,140
I'll be able to breathe.

602
00:52:45,010 --> 00:52:47,150
Why couldn't she take my side?

603
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:53,020
If only she had taken my side.

604
00:52:57,460 --> 00:52:59,330
It's no big deal.

605
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:01,690
It's okay.

606
00:53:06,370 --> 00:53:07,730
It's okay.

607
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:31,090
Play what you recorded with the piano tuner.

608
00:53:31,090 --> 00:53:32,660
I'll know when I hear it.

609
00:53:33,060 --> 00:53:36,330
There's a feeling of finality in a final piece. I'll find it.

610
00:53:39,830 --> 00:53:41,430
Are you ready?

611
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:43,100
I can't wait.

612
00:53:43,540 --> 00:53:45,670
The pianist is Kang In Wook.

613
00:54:10,630 --> 00:54:12,070
I'm scared,

614
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:14,230
but it's beautiful.

615
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:18,640
You shouldn't have told me.

616
00:54:19,970 --> 00:54:22,710
I found out why Won's mom died.

617
00:54:23,210 --> 00:54:26,650
It wasn't the blizzard.

618
00:54:27,810 --> 00:54:30,950
Why can't you take my side? Why? Why?

619
00:54:30,950 --> 00:54:33,050
My husband was involved.

620
00:54:34,890 --> 00:54:37,160
It's too much to bear on my own.

621
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:39,830
I want to tell the world,

622
00:54:40,690 --> 00:54:42,630
but I can't.

623
00:54:44,130 --> 00:54:46,100
That's why I'm writing you like this.

624
00:54:47,630 --> 00:54:51,100
With the assurance that it will never be read.

625
00:55:21,030 --> 00:55:22,840
Go with Ms. Moon.

626
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:26,070
She's more reliable than my mom.

627
00:55:26,340 --> 00:55:27,770
I'll be relieved then.

628
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:31,010
It won't snow.

629
00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:33,250
I can't leave.

630
00:55:35,210 --> 00:55:36,350
Leave.

631
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:40,550
I'll stay behind and find out the reason.

632
00:55:57,640 --> 00:55:58,870
Look at the ceiling.

633
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:03,080
It's soothing.

634
00:56:17,620 --> 00:56:18,860
Got it.

635
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:26,000
I found out why I sold...

636
00:56:26,830 --> 00:56:28,130
my dishes.

637
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:33,310
I found out the reason.

638
00:56:35,210 --> 00:56:36,440
I found out...

639
00:56:38,180 --> 00:56:39,450
the reason.

640
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:49,140
Not the blizzard. Maybe someone was involved.

641
00:56:49,140 --> 00:56:50,710
An external factor.

642
00:56:51,580 --> 00:56:54,210
She wasn't even in a shelter and died in a random place.

643
00:56:54,210 --> 00:56:56,920
We questioned and argued it more than 1,000 times.

644
00:56:56,950 --> 00:56:58,420
It looked like she went to pick you up...

645
00:56:58,420 --> 00:57:00,390
That's what I couldn't understand.

646
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:03,460
She knew the rules for evacuation better than anyone.

647
00:57:04,020 --> 00:57:05,960
Either the midway shelter or at the school.

648
00:57:07,390 --> 00:57:10,660
She knew that better than anyone. Why would she go there?

649
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:11,700
Won.

650
00:57:12,930 --> 00:57:15,070
I think Ji Soo found out something recently.

651
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:18,810
Ji Soo? If it were something you had to know,

652
00:57:18,810 --> 00:57:20,740
wouldn't she have told you?

653
00:57:21,310 --> 00:57:24,180
I'm sure she didn't because it wasn't worth telling you.

654
00:57:25,780 --> 00:57:27,380
She wanted to see you.

655
00:57:28,210 --> 00:57:30,380
She wrote you countless letters.

656
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:33,750
If she tried to tell me and not you, that means you didn't need to know.

657
00:57:34,550 --> 00:57:36,920
I'm positive there was another reason.

658
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:38,990
I'll sound like an old fogy, but I'll say it anyway.

659
00:57:38,990 --> 00:57:41,090
There are many things that make you miserable once you find out,

660
00:57:41,090 --> 00:57:42,700
and many things that you're better off not knowing.

661
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:45,060
I'm not scared at all...

662
00:57:45,060 --> 00:57:48,100
about what will happen afterward, or what will get better.

663
00:57:51,170 --> 00:57:52,940
What I fear most is...

664
00:57:55,170 --> 00:57:57,340
living without knowing something that I should know.

665
00:58:00,510 --> 00:58:02,010
It's so cold.

666
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:04,120
It's nippy at night.

667
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:08,960
Won.

668
00:58:11,290 --> 00:58:12,890
When I first met you...

669
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:14,760
in Boston...

670
00:58:16,060 --> 00:58:20,000
Remember how it would snow up to our knees?

671
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:23,500
Right? But someone was standing in the middle of the street,

672
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:26,310
looking up at the sky like this.

673
00:58:26,310 --> 00:58:30,080
With his neck bent all the way like it was about to snap.

674
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:32,250
But I looked closer,

675
00:58:33,210 --> 00:58:37,020
and he was glaring at the sky.

676
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:38,720
Talk about intense.

677
00:58:40,990 --> 00:58:42,020
Won.

678
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:45,020
Kim Ji Soo...

679
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:48,690
probably thought about it whenever it snowed too...

680
00:58:48,690 --> 00:58:50,400
and realized recently...

681
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:54,600
that what happened to Won's mom wasn't purely because of the snow,

682
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:56,370
but another reason...

683
00:58:57,170 --> 00:59:00,810
Very peacefully... She must have realized...

684
00:59:01,810 --> 00:59:03,140
something...

685
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:07,580
I feel like perhaps she wanted to tell you that.

686
00:59:07,580 --> 00:59:09,080
I do have an idea.

687
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:10,150
What?

688
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:11,750
The cause of Ji Soo's misery.

689
00:59:11,750 --> 00:59:14,920
You worked so hard for years not to know about her husband.

690
00:59:15,290 --> 00:59:17,290
I never said it was her husband.

691
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:20,990
Well, isn't that what you mean? You said you wouldn't find out.

692
00:59:21,690 --> 00:59:23,060
Keep it that way.

693
00:59:35,540 --> 00:59:36,610
What's up?

694
00:59:36,610 --> 00:59:37,610
Hey, Soon Ho.

695
00:59:37,980 --> 00:59:38,980
Yes?

696
00:59:38,980 --> 00:59:41,080
Is Kim Ji Soo's husband not Korean?

697
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:43,380
Why do you care? That's what I want to know.

698
00:59:43,380 --> 00:59:46,750
I thought Ji Soo and Ha Won were the only Koreans in Norway.

699
00:59:46,750 --> 00:59:48,350
That's why they're so tight.

700
00:59:48,690 --> 00:59:50,290
It was just the two of them.

701
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:53,590
Anyway, don't you dare ask Uncle things like that.

702
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:55,600
He left his cell phone.

703
00:59:55,700 --> 00:59:57,460
He needs his phone.

704
00:59:57,460 --> 00:59:59,630
- He left it intentionally. - Why?

705
00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:01,600
He's shutting out the world.

706
01:00:03,370 --> 01:00:04,740
Whatever. Let him be.

707
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:07,240
- Aren't you coming here? - Why would I?

708
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:08,740
I'm mad busy. Bye.

709
01:00:10,740 --> 01:00:11,840
Why is she getting mad?

710
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:23,860
Hey, you.

711
01:00:25,060 --> 01:00:27,030
Why are you loitering in front of my house? Move.

712
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:32,130
Why are you smiling?

713
01:00:32,470 --> 01:00:33,800
I'm here to see Seo Woo.

714
01:00:35,940 --> 01:00:37,000
Oh, 100 reasons...

715
01:00:39,540 --> 01:00:40,870
Hello.

716
01:00:48,710 --> 01:00:50,280
Come in.

717
01:00:57,260 --> 01:00:59,490
She isn't picking up.

718
01:00:59,730 --> 01:01:01,290
Didn't you call first?

719
01:01:02,860 --> 01:01:04,260
I'll go to the studio.

720
01:01:04,660 --> 01:01:06,000
Please tell her to come there.

721
01:01:06,900 --> 01:01:08,300
I forgot my phone.

722
01:01:09,540 --> 01:01:11,140
Have you had breakfast?

723
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:13,740
It's okay. My stomach isn't well.

724
01:01:13,740 --> 01:01:14,810
No.

725
01:01:15,110 --> 01:01:16,910
If I let you go without giving you at least water,

726
01:01:16,910 --> 01:01:18,380
Seo Woo will have my head.

727
01:01:21,850 --> 01:01:22,880
Come on.

728
01:01:29,390 --> 01:01:30,860
When your stomach is bothering you,

729
01:01:30,860 --> 01:01:32,390
nothing beats scorched rice.

730
01:01:50,210 --> 01:01:51,210
It's nice.

731
01:01:53,050 --> 01:01:55,780
Why did you come without making plans first?

732
01:01:58,750 --> 01:02:00,150
I must have come because I wanted to see her.

733
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:02,520
You're not here to tell her something bad, are you?

734
01:02:03,090 --> 01:02:04,790
I don't like Seo Woo being sad.

735
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:06,030
No.

736
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:08,160
When I see her,

737
01:02:10,100 --> 01:02:11,400
I can stop thinking.

738
01:02:12,730 --> 01:02:13,800
I feel at ease.

739
01:02:14,430 --> 01:02:16,470
Seo Woo has that effect, doesn't she?

740
01:02:18,270 --> 01:02:20,240
When I look at her, I feel encouraged.

741
01:02:21,470 --> 01:02:22,610
I'm like that too.

742
01:02:25,750 --> 01:02:27,050
But...

743
01:02:27,750 --> 01:02:30,850
why does Seo Woo have so many reasons?

744
01:02:32,890 --> 01:02:36,660
She said she liked someone, but 100 reasons stood in her way.

745
01:02:37,490 --> 01:02:39,090
I asked her to tell me each one,

746
01:02:39,090 --> 01:02:40,690
and they were all stupid.

747
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:44,730
Tell me just one.

748
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:49,070
She felt like someone else's misery was her happiness.

749
01:02:49,070 --> 01:02:50,240
How stupid.

750
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:51,700
Right?

751
01:02:53,340 --> 01:02:55,310
She's a tough cookie,

752
01:02:55,310 --> 01:02:56,940
but she gets depressed when it counts.

753
01:02:56,940 --> 01:02:58,510
You know how she's splat on her face at times.

754
01:02:58,510 --> 01:03:00,080
She's all dejected.

755
01:03:00,310 --> 01:03:02,150
"I don't know. I won't do it."

756
01:03:02,150 --> 01:03:03,380
"Leave me alone."

757
01:03:03,620 --> 01:03:05,580
Imagining 100 reasons...

758
01:03:05,790 --> 01:03:07,790
and she withdraws herself.

759
01:03:09,420 --> 01:03:10,520
Does it taste bad?

760
01:03:10,790 --> 01:03:12,490
Why aren't you eating? You're hurting my feelings.

761
01:03:16,730 --> 01:03:17,800
It's good.

762
01:03:41,350 --> 01:03:42,460
Oh my gosh.

763
01:03:54,300 --> 01:03:55,500
Something's up, isn't it?

764
01:03:56,470 --> 01:03:57,600
What is it this time?

765
01:03:58,840 --> 01:04:00,370
Tell me.

766
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:04,410
You're acting strange.

767
01:04:06,510 --> 01:04:07,550
What...

768
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:14,490
Go home. Don't wander around.

769
01:04:17,790 --> 01:04:19,190
You're going home, right?

770
01:04:22,930 --> 01:04:24,760
- I came to see Seo Woo. - Seo Woo?

771
01:04:25,330 --> 01:04:27,870
She's out recording Mr. Kang.

772
01:04:28,470 --> 01:04:30,070
We're filming a music video. Cool, right?

773
01:04:30,540 --> 01:04:32,270
We want to do as much PR as we can.

774
01:04:32,870 --> 01:04:35,140
- Did you make an appointment? - No.

775
01:04:36,280 --> 01:04:37,380
I just missed her.

776
01:04:38,080 --> 01:04:39,580
Oh my gosh. Hey.

777
01:04:41,750 --> 01:04:44,280
- Is that... Is that... - That's right.

778
01:05:05,300 --> 01:05:06,570
I can't do this here.

779
01:05:13,350 --> 01:05:14,450
It echoes too much.

780
01:05:19,290 --> 01:05:22,250
Just... Just pretend to play.

781
01:05:22,660 --> 01:05:24,760
We're doing this live because you insisted.

782
01:05:25,260 --> 01:05:27,930
We'll edit the video to the music anyway,

783
01:05:27,930 --> 01:05:29,060
so let's just do it.

784
01:05:29,660 --> 01:05:30,960
It's not like it's classical music.

785
01:05:46,750 --> 01:05:49,480
Ms. Moon considered the poster for the recital...

786
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:51,280
and wanted a location that would look nice.

787
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:53,090
That's why she chose this place.

788
01:05:53,490 --> 01:05:55,090
So you haven't been here.

789
01:05:55,790 --> 01:05:58,590
Even if that's why Soon Ho chose it, you should've checked it out.

790
01:06:01,660 --> 01:06:03,830
Narrowing it down to locations we can use right away,

791
01:06:03,830 --> 01:06:05,400
first is our studio,

792
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:07,470
second is Mr. Choi's studio.

793
01:06:08,030 --> 01:06:09,540
We can check his schedule.

794
01:06:09,540 --> 01:06:12,100
Or maybe somewhere you used to live?

795
01:06:12,100 --> 01:06:14,470
Someone you're familiar with may be good too.

796
01:06:14,870 --> 01:06:15,910
Home would be nice.

797
01:06:16,340 --> 01:06:18,410
The apartment where I lived when I was four.

798
01:06:18,780 --> 01:06:20,780
My aunt's house is in Oslo.

799
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:22,820
Does that work?

800
01:06:23,780 --> 01:06:25,520
How will we find a house with good acoustics in time?

801
01:06:26,950 --> 01:06:28,450
I do know of one.

802
01:06:29,190 --> 01:06:31,220
My friend said it has good acoustics.

803
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:34,790
Never mind.

804
01:06:36,860 --> 01:06:39,230
Second. Mr. Choi's studio.

805
01:06:39,770 --> 01:06:40,770
Okay.

806
01:06:56,080 --> 01:06:58,520
- You startled me. - Were you startled?

807
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:00,750
By this?

808
01:07:01,050 --> 01:07:03,260
I was so startled earlier that I almost fainted.

809
01:07:03,790 --> 01:07:05,990
- Did you hear? - What happened?

810
01:07:07,690 --> 01:07:11,000
As you can see. The acoustics were bad enough,

811
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:14,600
but the director said, "It isn't classical music."

812
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:17,000
So we're filming in Mr. Choi's studio.

813
01:07:17,240 --> 01:07:19,870
- I already arranged it. - No. It's not pretty there.

814
01:07:19,870 --> 01:07:22,370
It's pretty here, but the acoustics are horrible.

815
01:07:25,410 --> 01:07:26,480
You punk.

816
01:07:28,450 --> 01:07:29,850
That's right.

817
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:32,420
That's why you were so arrogant toward me.

818
01:07:33,150 --> 01:07:34,520
Seo Woo, you little...

819
01:07:37,960 --> 01:07:39,460
(Hoon)

820
01:07:43,430 --> 01:07:45,000
I said I won't come.

821
01:07:51,340 --> 01:07:52,600
(Eun Joo)

822
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:54,940
Did you see the guy who wanted to see you?

823
01:07:58,710 --> 01:08:00,150
(Phone)

824
01:08:00,680 --> 01:08:04,350
(Before Dawn)

825
01:08:07,720 --> 01:08:09,560
The phone is turned off.

826
01:08:15,030 --> 01:08:16,700
This is a big mess.

827
01:08:16,700 --> 01:08:20,600
All the plants at the entrance are dead.

828
01:08:21,970 --> 01:08:23,070
There's no way.

829
01:08:23,540 --> 01:08:25,370
- Send me a picture. - Come right away.

830
01:08:25,700 --> 01:08:26,910
Look for yourself.

831
01:08:29,140 --> 01:08:32,380
What... This punk. What's his problem?

832
01:08:32,980 --> 01:08:34,380
I'm going now.

833
01:08:36,420 --> 01:08:37,450
Let's go.

834
01:09:17,990 --> 01:09:19,220
They're fine.

835
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:29,970
He lied to me.

836
01:09:30,700 --> 01:09:31,770
Where is he?

837
01:09:46,790 --> 01:09:48,150
How pretty.

838
01:09:50,860 --> 01:09:52,020
Hoon, where are you?

839
01:09:55,030 --> 01:09:56,800
- They're totally fine. - Hold up.

840
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:58,960
Soon Ho. Hold up.

841
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:00,970
You need to save me.

842
01:10:01,900 --> 01:10:02,970
(My husband was involved)

843
01:10:02,970 --> 01:10:04,000
What's this?

844
01:10:04,170 --> 01:10:06,370
Ji Soo's husband killed Won's mom?

845
01:10:06,870 --> 01:10:09,510
Oh my gosh. That psycho.

846
01:10:09,940 --> 01:10:11,610
How could this be?

847
01:10:12,540 --> 01:10:14,150
Where can I find this jerk?

848
01:10:14,150 --> 01:10:15,650
I need to question him.

849
01:10:15,650 --> 01:10:16,820
I'm against it.

850
01:10:17,350 --> 01:10:18,420
Are you kidding me?

851
01:10:18,420 --> 01:10:21,720
You can't do anything with this. It'll only torment Won.

852
01:10:22,020 --> 01:10:25,220
Hoon. Let's say for argument's sake that Won catches that jerk.

853
01:10:25,220 --> 01:10:29,060
Once he finds out what happened, he'll end it right there.

854
01:10:29,660 --> 01:10:32,030
He's still Ji Soo's husband. He wouldn't do anything harsh.

855
01:10:32,030 --> 01:10:33,930
He won't do anything harsh? He should.

856
01:10:33,930 --> 01:10:37,870
Regardless, I don't care who he is. We have to catch him and finish him.

857
01:10:38,470 --> 01:10:39,640
I'll take care of it.

858
01:10:39,710 --> 01:10:42,670
Okay. Then rip it up. I trust you.

859
01:10:42,670 --> 01:10:43,780
You rip it up.

860
01:10:43,780 --> 01:10:45,440
It's your letter.

861
01:10:47,150 --> 01:10:50,980
Seriously. Ji Soo has such a tough life.

862
01:10:53,490 --> 01:10:55,550
(From Kim Ji Soo, To Moon Jung Sook)

863
01:10:57,060 --> 01:10:59,260
I found out...

864
01:10:59,790 --> 01:11:01,060
why I sold...

865
01:11:02,460 --> 01:11:03,730
my dishes.

866
01:11:04,430 --> 01:11:06,900
No. Never. She can never find out.

867
01:11:07,870 --> 01:11:09,970
She can't find out what happens to her.

868
01:11:09,970 --> 01:11:11,970
The more we talk, the more she finds out.

869
01:11:11,970 --> 01:11:14,540
And if we're unlucky, she'll find out everything.

870
01:11:14,540 --> 01:11:16,980
In the place that you like...

871
01:11:16,980 --> 01:11:19,440
with the ambience that you like.

872
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:22,110
Since you like it right before the sun sets.

873
01:11:22,680 --> 01:11:24,020
We're right on time.

874
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:27,220
The pianist is Kang In Wook.

875
01:11:27,950 --> 01:11:31,690
What touched you, Ji Soo?

876
01:11:44,170 --> 01:11:45,240
Won,

877
01:11:46,170 --> 01:11:47,970
do you want to go to Norway?

878
01:11:49,370 --> 01:11:51,710
You just have to say one thing.

879
01:11:51,740 --> 01:11:53,210
If Won says it's okay.

880
01:11:53,210 --> 01:11:56,580
Ji Soo said her husband made a mistake.

881
01:11:56,580 --> 01:11:57,850
The cause of Ji Soo's misery.

882
01:11:57,850 --> 01:12:01,020
You worked so hard for years not to know about her husband.

883
01:12:01,020 --> 01:12:02,920
I never said it was her husband.

884
01:12:03,060 --> 01:12:05,520
I found out why Won's mom died.

885
01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:50,500
(A Piece of Your Mind)

886
01:12:51,040 --> 01:12:52,370
Do you know about him?

887
01:12:52,370 --> 01:12:53,770
I like him a lot.

888
01:12:53,770 --> 01:12:56,580
Kim Ji Soo. That's my friend's name.

889
01:12:56,880 --> 01:12:58,510
Should I just ruin it?

890
01:12:58,540 --> 01:13:00,650
Don't hold it in. Scream and let it out.

891
01:13:02,350 --> 01:13:03,720
I'll stay with you.

892
01:13:04,420 --> 01:13:05,820
Do you want to live here?

893
01:13:06,150 --> 01:13:08,390
I like this place because there's nothing here.

894
01:13:08,390 --> 01:13:10,320
I guess you can't afford a frying pan.

895
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:12,020
I can fill it.

896
01:13:12,020 --> 01:13:13,860
Why are things getting so complicated?

897
01:13:13,860 --> 01:13:15,630
He's dying to know.

898
01:13:15,860 --> 01:13:19,060
Ha Won and Kang In Wook can never meet.
