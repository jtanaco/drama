<b>- Anchor Lee!
- Tell us something!</b>

2
00:00:08,947 --> 00:00:10,746
<b>- Say something!
- Anchor Lee!</b>

3
00:00:10,746 --> 00:00:12,116
<b>Hey, Lee Jeong Hoon!</b>

4
00:00:29,226 --> 00:00:31,566
<b>I picked up a huge scoop.</b>

5
00:00:32,596 --> 00:00:33,936
<b>Don't you want to know what it is?</b>

6
00:00:46,117 --> 00:00:47,846
<b>Man, he really gets on my nerves.</b>

7
00:00:49,047 --> 00:00:51,517
<b>Let's see how long you can
keep your head up high.</b>

8
00:00:51,856 --> 00:00:52,956
<b>What's the big scoop?</b>

9
00:00:53,456 --> 00:00:54,987
<b>- Tell us.
- What's the huge scoop?</b>

10
00:00:54,987 --> 00:00:56,496
<b>- May we talk for a moment?
- Tell us.</b>

11
00:00:56,496 --> 00:00:57,496
<b>Wait!</b>

12
00:01:01,767 --> 00:01:04,666
<b>Jeong Hoon, we need to talk.</b>

13
00:01:08,036 --> 00:01:09,036
<b>Come here.</b>

14
00:01:14,006 --> 00:01:16,676
<b>Did you know about this book too?</b>

15
00:01:16,676 --> 00:01:19,217
<b>No, not at all.
I haven't seen it until now.</b>

16
00:01:19,217 --> 00:01:22,616
<b>I knew it. You wouldn't give consent
to publish something like this.</b>

17
00:01:22,616 --> 00:01:24,256
<b>The author is
apparently your doctor.</b>

18
00:01:24,256 --> 00:01:26,857
<b>How can he write this book
without saying a word to you?</b>

19
00:01:26,857 --> 00:01:29,426
<b>Is this Yoo Sung Hyuk
really your doctor?</b>

20
00:01:29,426 --> 00:01:30,756
<b>Yes, he is.</b>

21
00:01:30,756 --> 00:01:32,797
<b>This is too awful.</b>

22
00:01:32,797 --> 00:01:34,926
<b>Mr. Kim came in with this,</b>

23
00:01:34,926 --> 00:01:36,866
<b>so I gave it a read.</b>

24
00:01:36,866 --> 00:01:39,737
<b>All he did was
replace your name with an initial.</b>

25
00:01:39,737 --> 00:01:42,006
<b>But the person's age, occupation,
and the current situation...</b>

26
00:01:42,006 --> 00:01:44,176
<b>all point to you.</b>

27
00:01:45,006 --> 00:01:47,806
<b>Did you see everyone
who swarmed in at the lobby?</b>

28
00:01:48,346 --> 00:01:50,446
<b>- Yes.
- They're already publishing...</b>

29
00:01:50,446 --> 00:01:54,247
<b>millions of articles
speculating you as this man.</b>

30
00:01:54,816 --> 00:01:58,217
<b>This book is liable
if you didn't know about this.</b>

31
00:01:58,217 --> 00:02:00,426
<b>You need to meet your doctor...</b>

32
00:02:00,756 --> 00:02:02,327
<b>and check on the situation.</b>

33
00:02:03,297 --> 00:02:04,926
<b>- Okay.
- Right.</b>

34
00:02:04,926 --> 00:02:06,827
<b>How's your stab? Is it all right?</b>

35
00:02:07,596 --> 00:02:09,196
<b>Yes, I'm fine.</b>

36
00:02:09,767 --> 00:02:12,137
<b>I forgot to ask
in the midst of this chaos.</b>

37
00:02:17,107 --> 00:02:18,107
<b>What?</b>

38
00:02:18,737 --> 00:02:20,246
<b>Hey, can you tell me?</b>

39
00:02:20,246 --> 00:02:22,347
<b>I'm sure you know
since you're close to him.</b>

40
00:02:22,577 --> 00:02:24,347
<b>- Is it really him?
- What's with you?</b>

41
00:02:24,347 --> 00:02:26,487
<b>Does he suffer from hyperthymesia?</b>

42
00:02:26,487 --> 00:02:29,186
<b>What's with you? I don't know.</b>

43
00:02:29,186 --> 00:02:30,257
<b>You really don't?</b>

44
00:02:30,487 --> 00:02:32,156
<b>Yes, I don't. I really don't.</b>

45
00:02:32,216 --> 00:02:35,026
<b>Man, in that case,
I'll ask him when he gets here.</b>

46
00:02:35,026 --> 00:02:36,857
<b>Why? There's no need to ask him.</b>

47
00:02:36,857 --> 00:02:38,496
<b>Just because. I'm curious.</b>

48
00:02:39,827 --> 00:02:40,926
<b>Why are you getting angry?</b>

49
00:02:40,926 --> 00:02:42,597
<b>Don't ask him anything.</b>

50
00:02:42,597 --> 00:02:44,537
<b>Hey, listen to this kid.</b>

51
00:02:44,537 --> 00:02:46,737
<b>He just got out of the hospital
after an operation.</b>

52
00:02:46,737 --> 00:02:48,067
<b>Don't ask him such a question.</b>

53
00:02:48,067 --> 00:02:49,537
<b>Hey, you're still doing that.</b>

54
00:02:49,537 --> 00:02:51,007
<b>- Jeong Hoon.
- Hey.</b>

55
00:02:51,237 --> 00:02:52,237
<b>Hello.</b>

56
00:02:52,577 --> 00:02:54,246
<b>Hey, you're here.</b>

57
00:02:57,876 --> 00:02:59,176
<b>Hey, you know...</b>

58
00:03:00,146 --> 00:03:01,586
<b>How are you feeling?</b>

59
00:03:02,086 --> 00:03:04,056
<b>Oh, yes. I'm fine.</b>

60
00:03:05,487 --> 00:03:07,327
<b>Okay. I'm glad.</b>

61
00:03:11,126 --> 00:03:12,257
<b>Are you sure you're okay?</b>

62
00:03:12,257 --> 00:03:14,526
<b>I saw Park Soo Chang in the lobby.</b>

63
00:03:14,526 --> 00:03:16,866
<b>- When did he get out?
- It has been a few days.</b>

64
00:03:17,097 --> 00:03:19,436
<b>He must have hired a good lawyer.
He got out on probation.</b>

65
00:03:19,436 --> 00:03:22,167
<b>What has he been up to?
Have you heard anything?</b>

66
00:03:22,436 --> 00:03:24,176
<b>I haven't really heard anything.</b>

67
00:03:24,776 --> 00:03:26,676
<b>But he can't work
in this field anyway.</b>

68
00:03:26,676 --> 00:03:27,947
<b>No one will hire him.</b>

69
00:03:27,947 --> 00:03:30,447
<b>His days as a reporter is over,
so I'm sure he'll do something else.</b>

70
00:03:32,146 --> 00:03:33,246
<b>All right.</b>

71
00:03:33,447 --> 00:03:34,887
<b>Let me know if you hear anything.</b>

72
00:03:34,887 --> 00:03:36,186
<b>Okay, I will.</b>

73
00:03:41,887 --> 00:03:43,496
<b>- Ha Kyung.
- Yes?</b>

74
00:03:43,496 --> 00:03:45,056
<b>Do we have any food ingredients?</b>

75
00:03:45,056 --> 00:03:46,567
<b>You know, like ham and eggs.</b>

76
00:03:47,567 --> 00:03:49,297
<b>- To do what?
- To make a lunch box...</b>

77
00:03:49,297 --> 00:03:50,797
<b>for me and Anchor Lee.</b>

78
00:03:50,797 --> 00:03:53,637
<b>Why do you want your perfectly
good relationship to fall in peril?</b>

79
00:03:53,637 --> 00:03:56,876
<b>Hey, we won't fall in peril
for making a lunch box.</b>

80
00:03:56,977 --> 00:03:58,836
<b>Back then,
it was my first time trying.</b>

81
00:03:59,276 --> 00:04:02,206
<b>Don't you think he'll be touched
when I make a lunch box for him?</b>

82
00:04:02,206 --> 00:04:04,977
<b>Yes, I think he'll show
a big reaction in another way.</b>

83
00:04:04,977 --> 00:04:07,686
<b>Gosh, what if he gets
too touched and cries?</b>

84
00:04:08,517 --> 00:04:10,357
<b>I don't have enough time
to make that again.</b>

85
00:04:10,357 --> 00:04:12,616
<b>Okay, try your best.
It's not for me anyway.</b>

86
00:04:12,616 --> 00:04:14,426
<b>Even if I don't try hard,
it should be pretty delicious.</b>

87
00:04:15,056 --> 00:04:18,257
<b>Wait, why are there
so many articles on Anchor Lee?</b>

88
00:04:18,257 --> 00:04:19,396
<b>About what?</b>

89
00:04:19,396 --> 00:04:20,426
<b>("Is Anchor Lee Suffering
From Hyperthymesia?")</b>

90
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:23,566
<b>Apparently, there's a book
about him.</b>

91
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:25,597
<b>A book?</b>

92
00:04:27,907 --> 00:04:31,136
<b>It's called
"The Man Who Cannot Forget".</b>

93
00:04:42,547 --> 00:04:43,556
<b>Excuse me.</b>

94
00:04:43,886 --> 00:04:44,917
<b>How may I help you?</b>

95
00:04:45,457 --> 00:04:47,527
<b>I've disclosed information
about my patient...</b>

96
00:04:47,926 --> 00:04:49,857
<b>whom I had been treating
for a long time.</b>

97
00:04:50,527 --> 00:04:52,227
<b>I've violated the medical law.</b>

98
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:56,066
<b>So you're a doctor,</b>

99
00:04:56,066 --> 00:04:58,467
<b>and you're turning yourself in...</b>

100
00:04:58,467 --> 00:05:00,607
<b>for disclosing
your patient's personal information?</b>

101
00:05:01,366 --> 00:05:02,366
<b>That's correct.</b>

102
00:05:04,376 --> 00:05:06,707
<b>I met his new lover...</b>

103
00:05:06,707 --> 00:05:09,777
<b>and told her about his illness.</b>

104
00:05:10,547 --> 00:05:14,787
<b>He will always have her
in his heart.</b>

105
00:05:17,157 --> 00:05:18,657
<b>Will you be okay with that?</b>

106
00:05:20,186 --> 00:05:21,756
<b>Will their love endure...</b>

107
00:05:21,857 --> 00:05:24,996
<b>this complicated
and frightening illness?</b>

108
00:05:26,696 --> 00:05:29,097
<b>Will he truly be able
to break free...</b>

109
00:05:29,397 --> 00:05:31,967
<b>from his past and love someone else?</b>

110
00:05:35,667 --> 00:05:37,176
<b>Although I'm skeptical,</b>

111
00:05:37,907 --> 00:05:40,576
<b>I do wish them the best...</b>

112
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:42,407
<b>and close this book.</b>

113
00:05:53,857 --> 00:05:55,087
<b>Do you have time?</b>

114
00:06:01,366 --> 00:06:04,397
<b>How are you feeling?
Shouldn't you still be resting?</b>

115
00:06:04,436 --> 00:06:05,837
<b>If you were that worried,</b>

116
00:06:05,837 --> 00:06:07,566
<b>you should've visited me
at the hospital.</b>

117
00:06:08,337 --> 00:06:09,407
<b>You must've been in a rush,</b>

118
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:10,676
<b>seeing how
you just left the fruit basket.</b>

119
00:06:10,676 --> 00:06:13,237
<b>I saw Ha Jin there, so I didn't want
to ruin it for you guys.</b>

120
00:06:14,907 --> 00:06:17,076
<b>Did you guys talk it out?</b>

121
00:06:17,076 --> 00:06:19,576
<b>Yes. I think so.</b>

122
00:06:20,316 --> 00:06:21,347
<b>I'm glad.</b>

123
00:06:22,016 --> 00:06:24,857
<b>You should be happy
that everything has worked out.</b>

124
00:06:25,917 --> 00:06:27,256
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

125
00:06:28,487 --> 00:06:29,727
<b>I'm talking about my father's book.</b>

126
00:06:30,657 --> 00:06:33,027
<b>I tried to dissuade him
and even threatened him.</b>

127
00:06:33,496 --> 00:06:35,066
<b>I tried my best.</b>

128
00:06:35,366 --> 00:06:36,667
<b>You knew?</b>

129
00:06:38,967 --> 00:06:40,667
<b>I should've told you in advance...</b>

130
00:06:41,066 --> 00:06:42,936
<b>and thought of a solution together.</b>

131
00:06:43,676 --> 00:06:44,777
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

132
00:06:46,707 --> 00:06:50,576
<b>To be honest, I'm quite flustered...</b>

133
00:06:51,516 --> 00:06:52,676
<b>and upset as well.</b>

134
00:06:53,847 --> 00:06:55,587
<b>But you shouldn't be sorry
about this.</b>

135
00:06:56,547 --> 00:06:57,987
<b>It's just an illness I have.</b>

136
00:06:58,287 --> 00:07:01,256
<b>I was never planning
to keep it a secret forever.</b>

137
00:07:02,787 --> 00:07:05,157
<b>But now that everyone
has found out, I'm a bit scared...</b>

138
00:07:05,157 --> 00:07:06,727
<b>about how they'll react.</b>

139
00:07:06,866 --> 00:07:08,926
<b>That's why we should
take care of this.</b>

140
00:07:09,266 --> 00:07:12,496
<b>Don't hold yourself back for us.</b>

141
00:07:13,936 --> 00:07:15,167
<b>What do you mean?</b>

142
00:07:15,237 --> 00:07:16,977
<b>I went to the police station.</b>

143
00:07:18,136 --> 00:07:19,176
<b>I turned myself in and told them...</b>

144
00:07:19,176 --> 00:07:21,647
<b>that I had disclosed
your information.</b>

145
00:07:22,777 --> 00:07:23,876
<b>Why would you do that?</b>

146
00:07:23,876 --> 00:07:25,717
<b>My father wanted to see
how you were doing...</b>

147
00:07:26,417 --> 00:07:28,547
<b>and asked me to send your results
every time you had your checkup.</b>

148
00:07:29,246 --> 00:07:30,987
<b>I had no idea he was planning this.</b>

149
00:07:31,686 --> 00:07:34,756
<b>Disclosing a patient's information
is a violation.</b>

150
00:07:35,657 --> 00:07:36,926
<b>We'll be penalized.</b>

151
00:07:37,297 --> 00:07:39,126
<b>And that book won't get sold.</b>

152
00:07:39,397 --> 00:07:41,266
<b>You want me to sue you?</b>

153
00:07:41,266 --> 00:07:43,766
<b>If you don't, I'll charge my father.</b>

154
00:07:43,766 --> 00:07:44,797
<b>Tae Eun.</b>

155
00:07:45,597 --> 00:07:49,107
<b>I'm sure he knew
you'd be soft like this.</b>

156
00:07:49,107 --> 00:07:51,576
<b>That's why he did the unthinkable.</b>

157
00:07:52,436 --> 00:07:54,176
<b>And that's why I want
to fix this even more.</b>

158
00:07:55,176 --> 00:07:58,977
<b>If something happens to you
because of this,</b>

159
00:08:00,287 --> 00:08:01,886
<b>I won't be able to stand it.</b>

160
00:08:02,886 --> 00:08:04,116
<b>So please do that.</b>

161
00:08:05,957 --> 00:08:06,987
<b>I'll be going now.</b>

162
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:27,647
<b>Do you want some coffee?</b>

163
00:08:29,006 --> 00:08:30,006
<b>Okay.</b>

164
00:08:33,647 --> 00:08:35,987
<b>What they said about Anchor Lee
is true, right?</b>

165
00:08:37,316 --> 00:08:40,457
<b>Did you already know
about his illness?</b>

166
00:08:41,327 --> 00:08:42,357
<b>Ha Kyung.</b>

167
00:08:42,656 --> 00:08:46,197
<b>How could a doctor disclose
his patient's information?</b>

168
00:08:46,197 --> 00:08:48,496
<b>It's about Anchor Lee.
He had no right to do that.</b>

169
00:08:50,597 --> 00:08:53,467
<b>I hope people won't think badly
about him.</b>

170
00:08:54,036 --> 00:08:55,636
<b>I'm worried...</b>

171
00:08:55,737 --> 00:08:58,237
<b>they'll be judgmental
when they know nothing about him.</b>

172
00:08:59,876 --> 00:09:01,876
<b>He did nothing wrong.</b>

173
00:09:03,616 --> 00:09:07,616
<b>Don't worry too much.
You know how people forget easily.</b>

174
00:09:08,217 --> 00:09:09,347
<b>They'll lose interest soon.</b>

175
00:09:09,987 --> 00:09:11,616
<b>I really hope so.</b>

176
00:09:14,357 --> 00:09:16,357
<b>I don't want him to hurt anymore.</b>

177
00:09:24,837 --> 00:09:26,467
<b>Guess where I am.</b>

178
00:09:52,227 --> 00:09:53,327
<b>Did you wait for a long time?</b>

179
00:09:53,796 --> 00:09:56,626
<b>No. You did well today.</b>

180
00:09:58,766 --> 00:09:59,967
<b>Did you miss me?</b>

181
00:10:00,937 --> 00:10:04,077
<b>Of course. I missed you so much.</b>

182
00:10:04,807 --> 00:10:05,906
<b>How about you?</b>

183
00:10:05,906 --> 00:10:08,847
<b>Me too. That's why I hurried over.</b>

184
00:10:09,807 --> 00:10:10,847
<b>How do you feel?</b>

185
00:10:10,947 --> 00:10:13,016
<b>Does the wound hurt?
Do you have a fever?</b>

186
00:10:13,477 --> 00:10:15,886
<b>I'm doing fine, and it doesn't hurt.</b>

187
00:10:16,746 --> 00:10:18,187
<b>You don't seem to be having a fever.</b>

188
00:10:18,717 --> 00:10:20,256
<b>Are you sure you're okay?</b>

189
00:10:20,487 --> 00:10:22,156
<b>I'm positive.</b>

190
00:10:22,727 --> 00:10:25,727
<b>Okay. You've passed.
We can go on a picnic.</b>

191
00:10:26,697 --> 00:10:27,697
<b>A picnic?</b>

192
00:10:27,697 --> 00:10:30,396
<b>Going on a picnic is the best way
to get some fresh air.</b>

193
00:10:33,807 --> 00:10:36,266
<b>We just need to walk a bit more.
We're almost there.</b>

194
00:10:37,376 --> 00:10:39,636
<b>I've never gone on a picnic
at this hour before.</b>

195
00:10:40,447 --> 00:10:41,776
<b>The time doesn't matter.</b>

196
00:10:41,776 --> 00:10:43,616
<b>What matters
is whom you're going with.</b>

197
00:10:45,546 --> 00:10:47,817
<b>I packed a lunchbox and a mat.</b>

198
00:10:49,286 --> 00:10:52,256
<b>Don't tell me you made that.</b>

199
00:10:52,756 --> 00:10:54,286
<b>Of course, I did.</b>

200
00:10:56,357 --> 00:10:59,057
<b>Why? Are you afraid
you'd feel extremely touched?</b>

201
00:11:00,796 --> 00:11:03,366
<b>I'm touched and scared.</b>

202
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:05,536
<b>It's going to be delicious.</b>

203
00:11:06,636 --> 00:11:08,136
<b>You're doing it again.
It's dangerous.</b>

204
00:11:08,906 --> 00:11:10,276
<b>Walk properly.</b>

205
00:11:11,707 --> 00:11:14,677
<b>It's not dangerous
if you're holding onto me.</b>

206
00:11:15,607 --> 00:11:18,046
<b>I know you'll be holding onto me
in the future as well.</b>

207
00:11:32,357 --> 00:11:34,827
<b>There. Sit down.</b>

208
00:11:36,626 --> 00:11:38,666
<b>Can I finally see what you've made?</b>

209
00:11:38,996 --> 00:11:40,967
<b>Oh, right. I almost forgot.</b>

210
00:11:41,737 --> 00:11:43,977
<b>Since it's late,
I just made some simple stuff.</b>

211
00:11:44,337 --> 00:11:47,246
<b>I gave it my all,
so you better finish it.</b>

212
00:11:49,246 --> 00:11:50,376
<b>Ta-da.</b>

213
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:52,116
<b>I see.</b>

214
00:11:53,886 --> 00:11:55,116
<b>That's it?</b>

215
00:11:55,786 --> 00:11:57,016
<b>It looks nice.</b>

216
00:11:57,687 --> 00:12:00,927
<b>There are various shapes,
and they look unique.</b>

217
00:12:02,727 --> 00:12:03,796
<b>Is this a dolphin?</b>

218
00:12:03,957 --> 00:12:04,996
<b>Bingo.</b>

219
00:12:05,697 --> 00:12:09,697
<b>This must be your feelings
toward me.</b>

220
00:12:10,227 --> 00:12:11,366
<b>You're right. It's a heart.</b>

221
00:12:11,567 --> 00:12:13,906
<b>A heart. And...</b>

222
00:12:14,636 --> 00:12:15,707
<b>Is this a rabbit?</b>

223
00:12:15,707 --> 00:12:17,437
<b>Isn't it obvious?</b>

224
00:12:17,437 --> 00:12:18,536
<b>You're right.</b>

225
00:12:18,536 --> 00:12:20,546
<b>I was really passionate
about making the rabbits.</b>

226
00:12:20,646 --> 00:12:24,077
<b>You may have been too passionate
and cut off an ear.</b>

227
00:12:24,516 --> 00:12:25,546
<b>You're right.</b>

228
00:12:30,246 --> 00:12:31,286
<b>Isn't it good?</b>

229
00:12:33,286 --> 00:12:34,357
<b>It is.</b>

230
00:12:37,197 --> 00:12:38,327
<b>Did you read the book?</b>

231
00:12:41,026 --> 00:12:43,766
<b>Did you plan all of this
to cheer me up?</b>

232
00:12:46,567 --> 00:12:47,607
<b>Yes.</b>

233
00:12:48,266 --> 00:12:50,437
<b>Why didn't you tell me
that you met with Professor Yoo?</b>

234
00:12:51,177 --> 00:12:52,376
<b>You must've been very surprised.</b>

235
00:12:53,177 --> 00:12:55,776
<b>The things he said
didn't matter one bit to me.</b>

236
00:12:58,046 --> 00:13:00,516
<b>You said you were happy.</b>

237
00:13:01,646 --> 00:13:03,016
<b>That's good enough for me.</b>

238
00:13:03,546 --> 00:13:04,656
<b>What about now?</b>

239
00:13:06,857 --> 00:13:08,087
<b>Are you still happy?</b>

240
00:13:09,156 --> 00:13:11,327
<b>Yes, I am.</b>

241
00:13:14,467 --> 00:13:15,796
<b>That's good enough for me too.</b>

242
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:17,967
<b>I'm glad.</b>

243
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:22,406
<b>I'm not sure if this will help,</b>

244
00:13:23,366 --> 00:13:25,536
<b>but people forget things
more easily than you think.</b>

245
00:13:27,246 --> 00:13:30,006
<b>So I hope you won't be
in too much pain.</b>

246
00:13:31,847 --> 00:13:32,916
<b>Okay.</b>

247
00:13:35,587 --> 00:13:37,717
<b>Isn't it uncomfortable to sit here?</b>

248
00:13:37,717 --> 00:13:39,286
<b>It may not be good for your wound.</b>

249
00:13:41,156 --> 00:13:42,227
<b>Hold on.</b>

250
00:13:43,857 --> 00:13:44,927
<b>Lie down.</b>

251
00:13:45,656 --> 00:13:46,756
<b>Lie down?</b>

252
00:13:56,467 --> 00:13:58,937
<b>Going on a picnic at 1 a.m.
isn't that bad, right?</b>

253
00:14:01,677 --> 00:14:04,276
<b>Didn't I do a fantastic job
planning this date?</b>

254
00:14:20,427 --> 00:14:21,927
<b>This is part of our date too.</b>

255
00:14:21,927 --> 00:14:23,526
<b>The last part of our date.</b>

256
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:26,166
<b>It's nice.</b>

257
00:14:27,567 --> 00:14:29,906
<b>I especially like the last part.</b>

258
00:15:05,776 --> 00:15:07,607
<b>I heard from Anchor Lee.</b>

259
00:15:07,977 --> 00:15:09,077
<b>He told me that you're trying...</b>

260
00:15:09,077 --> 00:15:10,977
<b>your best to fix the situation
regarding the book.</b>

261
00:15:11,746 --> 00:15:14,817
<b>I'm worried that
you might get hurt from this too.</b>

262
00:15:14,817 --> 00:15:16,487
<b>You don't have to worry about me.</b>

263
00:15:16,487 --> 00:15:17,687
<b>I'm okay.</b>

264
00:15:18,116 --> 00:15:21,187
<b>But please take good care
of Jeong Hoon.</b>

265
00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:23,187
<b>This must be hard for him to bear.</b>

266
00:15:23,457 --> 00:15:26,357
<b>This is the same as getting
betrayed by a trusted friend.</b>

267
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:28,827
<b>I will.</b>

268
00:15:28,927 --> 00:15:32,237
<b>And I want to apologize
to you as well.</b>

269
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:35,136
<b>Whatever my father told you,</b>

270
00:15:35,506 --> 00:15:37,337
<b>don't let that get to you.</b>

271
00:15:37,707 --> 00:15:39,536
<b>Why do you keep apologizing?</b>

272
00:15:39,776 --> 00:15:41,406
<b>It's not even your fault.</b>

273
00:15:44,746 --> 00:15:48,416
<b>Actually, I asked you to see me
because I had something to tell you.</b>

274
00:15:49,217 --> 00:15:50,516
<b>What is it?</b>

275
00:15:51,357 --> 00:15:53,687
<b>Do you remember
what you told me the other day?</b>

276
00:15:54,487 --> 00:15:57,927
<b>You said you didn't want
to make the same mistake again.</b>

277
00:15:59,296 --> 00:16:01,366
<b>That's been on my mind.</b>

278
00:16:02,827 --> 00:16:04,237
<b>What happened in the past...</b>

279
00:16:05,567 --> 00:16:08,337
<b>was neither your mistake
nor responsibility.</b>

280
00:16:09,107 --> 00:16:10,837
<b>It was my decision.</b>

281
00:16:13,237 --> 00:16:15,876
<b>So you don't need to be sorry
about what happened.</b>

282
00:16:17,317 --> 00:16:20,116
<b>I am always grateful to you.</b>

283
00:16:21,016 --> 00:16:23,046
<b>I was grateful back then
and still am.</b>

284
00:16:26,386 --> 00:16:28,487
<b>I wanted to tell you this.</b>

285
00:16:30,597 --> 00:16:33,496
<b>Thank you for saying that.</b>

<b>It was you who pressed

308
00:17:58,917 --> 00:18:00,016
<b>you were wrong.</b>

309
00:18:00,016 --> 00:18:01,516
<b>How was I wrong?</b>

310
00:18:01,516 --> 00:18:05,056
<b>It looks like Jeong Hoon found
a way to live in the present...</b>

311
00:18:05,056 --> 00:18:07,927
<b>while keeping his past with him.</b>

312
00:18:08,627 --> 00:18:09,786
<b>It was you...</b>

313
00:18:09,786 --> 00:18:12,727
<b>who couldn't accept that
and stayed in the past.</b>

314

<b>What on earth are you talking about?</b>

315
00:18:15,467 --> 00:18:18,836
<b>Do you even know
what you're jabbering about now?</b>

316
00:18:20,596 --> 00:18:22,506
<b>If you're done, please leave.</b>

317
00:18:22,707 --> 00:18:24,506
<b>I need to wrap things up here.</b>

318

<b>("Lee Jeong Hoon,
Is He Really a Gentle Tyrant?")</b>

319
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:41,387
<b>This must be the revenge
Park Soo Chang prepared for me.</b>

320
00:18:41,387 --> 00:18:43,687
<b>I knew that he was a jerk.</b>

321
00:18:43,687 --> 00:18:45,496
<b>I had no idea he was a scumbag.</b>

322
00:18:46,026 --> 00:18:48,566
<b>I'm sure he'll talk about the book.
Is this okay?</b>

323
00:18:48,967 --> 00:18:50,836
<b>Perhaps, we should stop him.</b>

324
00:18:50,836 --> 00:18:52,336
<b>I could make it worse...</b>

325
00:18:52,336 --> 00:18:53,836
<b>if I make my move rashly.</b>

326

<b>Let's watch his show today.</b>

327
00:18:57,606 --> 00:18:58,776
<b>Hello.</b>

328
00:18:59,006 --> 00:19:00,746
<b>I was fired from my job a while ago.</b>

329
00:19:00,746 --> 00:19:03,276
<b>I'm Reporter Park Soo Chang
of "Real Entertainment".</b>

330
00:19:03,276 --> 00:19:06,717
<b>It turns out that a lot of people
were waiting for my show.</b>

331
00:19:06,717 --> 00:19:08,117
<b>Thank you so much.</b>

332
00:19:08,586 --> 00:19:12,117
<b>The question I got
the most from you guys was...</b>

333
00:19:12,117 --> 00:19:15,227
<b>if the main character of "The Man
Who Cannot Forget", H,</b>

334
00:19:15,227 --> 00:19:18,457
<b>was truly Anchor Lee.
That was the question.</b>

335
00:19:18,996 --> 00:19:21,596
<b>Talking about what everyone
already knows won't be fun.</b>

336
00:19:21,596 --> 00:19:25,367
<b>I like putting "first"
or "exclusive" on my articles.</b>

337
00:19:25,367 --> 00:19:29,036
<b>I prepared to share something new.</b>

338
00:19:29,336 --> 00:19:31,907
<b>Here's what I prepared.</b>

339
00:19:34,947 --> 00:19:36,276
<b>(The 29th Yearbook)</b>

340
00:19:36,276 --> 00:19:37,306
<b>This is it.</b>

341
00:19:37,546 --> 00:19:40,046
<b>This is the yearbook
of Yeo Ha Jin's high school.</b>

342
00:19:40,046 --> 00:19:43,086
<b>All right. Take a look.</b>

343
00:19:43,286 --> 00:19:45,957
<b>Right here. Do you see her name?</b>

344
00:19:46,516 --> 00:19:47,887
<b>"Yeo Ha Jin".</b>

345
00:19:48,026 --> 00:19:50,796
<b>Let's take a look
at the group photo.</b>

346
00:19:50,796 --> 00:19:53,697
<b>She always took photos
with this girl.</b>

347
00:19:53,697 --> 00:19:55,326
<b>She must be her best friend,</b>

348
00:19:55,326 --> 00:19:57,367
<b>but when I looked at her name,</b>

349
00:19:57,367 --> 00:19:59,167
<b>it sounded quite familiar.</b>

350
00:19:59,697 --> 00:20:03,066
<b>I thought about
where I heard her name from.</b>

351
00:20:03,106 --> 00:20:04,707
<b>And I remembered a name.</b>

352
00:20:05,106 --> 00:20:06,106
<b>It was...</b>

353
00:20:06,606 --> 00:20:09,746
<b>Sadly, she died
in a tragic incident.</b>

354
00:20:10,346 --> 00:20:13,246
<b>It was Anchor Lee's first love. Yes.</b>

355
00:20:13,677 --> 00:20:17,016
<b>She used to be
Yeo Ha Jin's best friend.</b>

356
00:20:17,816 --> 00:20:20,187
<b>Everyone, how does this make sense?</b>

357
00:20:20,187 --> 00:20:22,427
<b>The woman he loved died.</b>

358
00:20:22,627 --> 00:20:25,657
<b>But he fell in love
with the woman's best friend again.</b>

359
00:20:25,897 --> 00:20:28,127
<b>Do you think it's possible?
I don't think I can do it.</b>

360
00:20:28,127 --> 00:20:30,427
<b>Why don't I read your opinions?</b>

361
00:20:30,427 --> 00:20:33,296
<b>"I didn't peg him
to be a piece of trash."</b>

362
00:20:33,596 --> 00:20:35,566
<b>Everyone has
a similar opinion with me.</b>

363
00:20:35,566 --> 00:20:38,276
<b>Ethically, this can't be. You know.</b>

364
00:20:38,276 --> 00:20:41,407
<b>That's why I was very shocked after
reading about their relationship.</b>

365
00:20:41,947 --> 00:20:44,746
<b>Seo Yeon and Ha Jin
were really close.</b>

366
00:20:44,746 --> 00:20:47,617
<b>Yeo Ha Jin recently played a role
in a morning soap opera...</b>

367
00:20:47,617 --> 00:20:49,516
<b>I heard they've been friends
ever since they were kids.</b>

368
00:20:49,516 --> 00:20:51,657
<b>Doesn't that mean
she already knew about him...</b>

369
00:20:51,657 --> 00:20:53,117
<b>when her friend dated him?</b>

370
00:20:53,516 --> 00:20:56,256
<b>No way.
Then, when her friend was alive,</b>

371
00:20:56,326 --> 00:20:57,697
<b>did they have a fling or something?</b>

372
00:20:57,697 --> 00:20:59,326
<b>Just the thought creeps me out.</b>

373
00:20:59,326 --> 00:21:02,467
<b>My gosh. I'm more disappointed
in Lee Jeong Hoon.</b>

374
00:21:02,526 --> 00:21:04,127
<b>I didn't think he was such a jerk.</b>

375
00:21:06,737 --> 00:21:08,667
<b>Is this too much?</b>

376
00:21:08,967 --> 00:21:11,336
<b>They might think this doesn't
suit my role as a teacher.</b>

377
00:21:11,336 --> 00:21:12,576
<b>Come on. It's not a shoot.</b>

378
00:21:12,576 --> 00:21:14,606
<b>It's just a meeting with a director.
Why not?</b>

379
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:15,707
<b>You look pretty.</b>

380
00:21:15,707 --> 00:21:16,907
<b>- I do?
- Yes.</b>

381
00:21:16,907 --> 00:21:18,417
<b>I should put on a different pair.</b>

382
00:21:18,776 --> 00:21:20,947
<b>If you ask me one more time,
I'll kill you.</b>

383
00:21:21,387 --> 00:21:22,387
<b>Gosh.</b>

384
00:21:23,316 --> 00:21:25,617
<b>Goodness.</b>

385
00:21:26,056 --> 00:21:27,627
<b>Ms. Park, did something happen?</b>

386
00:21:27,856 --> 00:21:30,127
<b>The production company
just called me...</b>

387
00:21:30,127 --> 00:21:32,356
<b>to cancel the meeting.</b>

388
00:21:32,356 --> 00:21:34,796
<b>How could they be so rude?</b>

389
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:36,996
<b>I'm sure something urgent came up.</b>

390
00:21:36,996 --> 00:21:38,437
<b>Did they reschedule?</b>

391
00:21:38,437 --> 00:21:39,897
<b>They didn't even say that.</b>

392
00:21:39,897 --> 00:21:41,737
<b>That's why I'm angrier.</b>

393
00:21:41,737 --> 00:21:44,937
<b>Out of the blue, they just said
it'd be best if we didn't meet.</b>

394
00:21:45,907 --> 00:21:46,977
<b>Hold on.</b>

395
00:21:48,877 --> 00:21:50,746
<b>What is it? You're worrying me.</b>

396
00:21:52,977 --> 00:21:54,786
<b>Has he lost his mind?</b>

397
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:57,687
<b>- What is it?
- It was Anchor Lee's first love.</b>

398
00:21:57,887 --> 00:21:59,816
<b>She used to be
Yeo Ha Jin's best friend.</b>

399
00:22:00,786 --> 00:22:01,786
<b>Everyone.</b>

400
00:22:03,427 --> 00:22:04,596
<b>Why did you watch that?</b>

401
00:22:04,596 --> 00:22:05,996
<b>I said you would only get mad.</b>

402
00:22:05,996 --> 00:22:08,766
<b>Why is Reporter Park
going such length to torture us?</b>

403
00:22:08,766 --> 00:22:10,367
<b>We were the victims.</b>

404
00:22:10,367 --> 00:22:12,096
<b>That scumbag doesn't need a reason.</b>

405
00:22:12,096 --> 00:22:13,637
<b>He's just a scumbag.</b>

406
00:22:15,137 --> 00:22:17,336
<b>Did you talk to Anchor Lee about it?</b>

407
00:22:18,377 --> 00:22:19,977
<b>We talked on the phone earlier.</b>

408
00:22:19,977 --> 00:22:21,947
<b>But he only asked me
where I was and hung up.</b>

409
00:22:23,707 --> 00:22:25,917
<b>Things must be hectic for him too.</b>

410
00:22:26,677 --> 00:22:29,016
<b>He already has a lot on his plate
with the publication.</b>

411
00:22:29,617 --> 00:22:32,617
<b>How come we never have
an uneventful day?</b>

412
00:22:33,887 --> 00:22:35,127
<b>I agree.</b>

413
00:22:41,727 --> 00:22:42,727
<b>Hold on.</b>

414
00:22:43,066 --> 00:22:44,197
<b>- Don't open it, Ha Jin.
- Wait.</b>

415

<b>- It's Ha Jin.
- It's Yeo Ha Jin.</b>

416

<b>Is it true you were a close friend
of Anchor Lee's first love?</b>

417
00:22:49,437 --> 00:22:51,506
<b>Were you really friends
with the woman...</b>

418

<b>from "The Man Who Cannot Forget"?</b>

419

<b>What did Anchor Lee say

420
00:22:54,506 --> 00:22:56,147
<b>- Say something.
- Say a word.</b>

421

<b>- Answer our questions.
- Ms. Yeo!</b>

<b>- That's Anchor Lee!
- What?</b>

423
00:23:00,776 --> 00:23:02,846
<b>- That's Anchor Lee.
- That's Anchor Lee.</b>

<b>- It's Lee Jeong Hoon.
- It's Jeong Hoon.</b>

<b>- He's coming here.
- Say something.</b>

426

<b>- Say something.
- Jeong Hoon.</b>

427

<b>- Answer our questions.
- Is everything true?</b>

428

<b>- Say something.
- Is it true?</b>

<b>- Please say something.

<b>- Can you answer our questions?

<b>- Anything for today's news?

<b>- Please say something.

<b>- Don't avoid us. Answer it!

<b>- Anchor Lee!

<b>Why don't we talk?</b>

<b>You must've been caught off guard.</b>

441
00:23:36,887 --> 00:23:39,316
<b>Is your wound okay?
Are you overworking yourself?</b>

442

<b>I'm okay now. I'm good as new.</b>

<b>All right, thanks.</b>

458
00:24:45,957 --> 00:24:49,127
<b>(All right, thanks.)</b>

459
00:24:55,967 --> 00:24:57,167
<b>Your feet are cold, aren't they?</b>

460
00:24:57,937 --> 00:24:58,967
<b>Wear these.</b>

461
00:24:59,667 --> 00:25:01,637
<b>- What are these?
- Slippers.</b>

462
00:25:02,566 --> 00:25:04,877
<b>Are... Are these
the only ones you have?</b>

463
00:25:05,006 --> 00:25:07,407
<b>You're a guest,
so I'm giving you my favorites.</b>

464
00:25:07,407 --> 00:25:08,477
<b>They're new.</b>

465
00:25:09,106 --> 00:25:11,147
<b>I want something
a little more simple.</b>

466
00:25:12,046 --> 00:25:13,546
<b>Those are the simplest ones.</b>

467
00:25:14,046 --> 00:25:15,516
<b>Thank you, I guess.</b>

468
00:25:17,217 --> 00:25:18,786
<b>Did you eat dinner?</b>

469
00:25:19,457 --> 00:25:21,356
<b>No, I was really busy.</b>

470
00:25:21,586 --> 00:25:24,727
<b>That's great. My dinner plans
got canceled, so I haven't eaten.</b>

471
00:25:24,756 --> 00:25:25,897
<b>Do you want to make something?</b>

472
00:25:25,897 --> 00:25:28,066
<b>"Make something"?
Are you going to cook?</b>

473
00:25:28,066 --> 00:25:30,967
<b>It takes me a while to cook,
but I'm a good cook when I try.</b>

474
00:25:31,667 --> 00:25:34,707
<b>I know you're good when you put
your heart and soul into it.</b>

475
00:25:35,606 --> 00:25:37,937
<b>But I'm way too hungry
to wait a long time,</b>

476
00:25:37,937 --> 00:25:39,377
<b>so let's eat something simple.</b>

477
00:25:39,377 --> 00:25:40,576
<b>What a relief.</b>

478
00:25:42,647 --> 00:25:44,877
<b>Something simple sounds good.
Do you need help?</b>

479
00:25:46,016 --> 00:25:47,846
<b>Can you get stuff from that cabinet?</b>

480
00:25:51,957 --> 00:25:53,316
<b>What are all these?</b>

481
00:25:53,957 --> 00:25:56,326
<b>This is the cabinet for
everything that's delicious.</b>

482
00:25:56,326 --> 00:25:58,256
<b>I can only eat these
when Ha Kyung gives them to me.</b>

483
00:25:59,496 --> 00:26:01,826
<b>Your manager is very strict.</b>

484
00:26:03,167 --> 00:26:04,197
<b>Okay.</b>

485
00:26:04,197 --> 00:26:06,266
<b>I'm not taking anything out
with my hands.</b>

486
00:26:06,296 --> 00:26:07,496
<b>What do you want?</b>

487
00:26:08,737 --> 00:26:09,766
<b>Bread!</b>

488
00:26:10,907 --> 00:26:11,937
<b>Bread.</b>

489
00:26:13,836 --> 00:26:16,246
<b>And chocolate jam.</b>

490
00:26:16,246 --> 00:26:17,546
<b>Chocolate jam.</b>

491
00:26:18,016 --> 00:26:20,647
<b>And popcorn.
And cookies too, right below.</b>

492
00:26:24,887 --> 00:26:26,356
<b>Are you sure you can eat everything?</b>

493
00:26:26,516 --> 00:26:28,826
<b>The only thing Ha Kyung and I
have in common is our stomach.</b>

494
00:26:28,826 --> 00:26:30,086
<b>This is a piece of cake.</b>

495
00:26:39,836 --> 00:26:40,937
<b>Anchor Lee, open your mouth.</b>

496
00:26:40,937 --> 00:26:41,967
<b>My mouth?</b>

497
00:26:46,707 --> 00:26:48,207
<b>Isn't this delicious?</b>

498
00:26:48,746 --> 00:26:50,447
<b>It tastes exactly like
how I imagined it would be.</b>

499
00:26:52,276 --> 00:26:53,316
<b>Anchor Lee, open your mouth.</b>

500
00:26:53,316 --> 00:26:54,417
<b>Again?</b>

501
00:26:56,117 --> 00:26:57,846
<b>I think I'm all done.</b>

502
00:26:57,846 --> 00:27:00,816
<b>No way.
You have to keep having a bite...</b>

503
00:27:00,816 --> 00:27:02,086
<b>to be my accomplice.</b>

504
00:27:02,086 --> 00:27:03,727
<b>Are you really going to
finish everything?</b>

505
00:27:03,927 --> 00:27:05,427
<b>I forgot to bring
something very important.</b>

506
00:27:21,246 --> 00:27:22,707
<b>This is yours, this is mine.</b>

507
00:27:22,707 --> 00:27:24,177
<b>Mine, thanks.</b>

508
00:27:24,246 --> 00:27:25,346
<b>Let's make a toast.</b>

509
00:27:26,046 --> 00:27:27,417
<b>- Cheers.
- Cheers.</b>

510
00:27:45,367 --> 00:27:46,397
<b>Take it off.</b>

511
00:27:49,407 --> 00:27:50,437
<b>You said it was your first...</b>

512
00:27:50,437 --> 00:27:52,036
<b>Let's keep doing things
the way we did today.</b>

513
00:27:56,746 --> 00:27:58,617
<b>Things will be
pretty rough for a while.</b>

514
00:28:01,046 --> 00:28:03,687
<b>It might take
much longer than we thought,</b>

515
00:28:04,756 --> 00:28:07,286
<b>and it might be
much harder than we expected.</b>

516
00:28:10,427 --> 00:28:11,496
<b>But like today,</b>

517
00:28:13,397 --> 00:28:14,556
<b>let's bear through.</b>

518
00:28:16,326 --> 00:28:17,427
<b>I'll do that.</b>

519
00:28:19,496 --> 00:28:20,737
<b>I'll be even better.</b>

520
00:28:22,707 --> 00:28:24,066
<b>Just like today.</b>

521
00:28:25,707 --> 00:28:26,806
<b>Anchor Lee,</b>

522
00:28:27,806 --> 00:28:29,647
<b>you can just do everything
as you did today.</b>

523
00:28:31,746 --> 00:28:32,816
<b>I'll do that.</b>

524
00:28:58,986 --> 00:29:00,986
<b>(Episode 30)</b>

525
00:29:03,986 --> 00:29:06,426
<b>- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.</b>

526
00:29:07,125 --> 00:29:08,766
<b>Why are you calling me this early?</b>

527
00:29:08,996 --> 00:29:09,996
<b>Me?</b>

528
00:29:10,225 --> 00:29:12,795
<b>I'm on my way to the airport.</b>

529
00:29:13,836 --> 00:29:16,406
<b>The airport? Why?</b>

530
00:29:16,866 --> 00:29:19,106
<b>I'm leaving
to volunteer as a doctor.</b>

531
00:29:19,805 --> 00:29:21,746
<b>I've been thinking about this
for a while,</b>

532
00:29:21,746 --> 00:29:23,206
<b>but I finally got
a great opportunity.</b>

533
00:29:24,005 --> 00:29:27,715
<b>Volunteering as a doctor?
What are you talking about?</b>

534
00:29:27,915 --> 00:29:28,915
<b>What about your clinic?</b>

535
00:29:29,516 --> 00:29:31,256
<b>I already closed it last week.</b>

536
00:29:31,455 --> 00:29:32,985
<b>And you're telling me this now?</b>

537
00:29:33,086 --> 00:29:35,125
<b>On your way to the airport,
over the phone?</b>

538
00:29:35,226 --> 00:29:36,726
<b>I forgot to tell you.</b>

539
00:29:36,955 --> 00:29:39,525
<b>Everything was decided in a flash,
so I've been out of it.</b>

540
00:29:40,196 --> 00:29:42,595
<b>Right, let me say this just in case.</b>

541
00:29:42,595 --> 00:29:44,366
<b>I'm not leaving because of you,</b>

542
00:29:44,366 --> 00:29:45,766
<b>so don't take this the wrong way.</b>

543
00:29:45,766 --> 00:29:47,936
<b>You don't mean that much
in my life anyway.</b>

544
00:29:48,565 --> 00:29:50,036
<b>Don't be so hard on yourself.</b>

545
00:29:51,305 --> 00:29:52,775
<b>How can you joke around right now?</b>

546
00:29:53,836 --> 00:29:55,245
<b>Then should I be crying?</b>

547
00:29:56,705 --> 00:29:58,315
<b>I'm not running away.</b>

548
00:29:58,845 --> 00:30:02,215
<b>For the first time, I seriously
thought about what I wanted to do,</b>

549
00:30:02,816 --> 00:30:04,286
<b>then made this decision.</b>

550
00:30:04,715 --> 00:30:06,655
<b>So I mean it. Don't worry about me.</b>

551
00:30:07,456 --> 00:30:09,325
<b>It's a relief
if that's really the case.</b>

552
00:30:10,126 --> 00:30:11,995
<b>But why didn't you tell me before?
What is...</b>

553
00:30:12,726 --> 00:30:14,295
<b>I couldn't even say goodbye.
What is this?</b>

554
00:30:14,495 --> 00:30:16,366
<b>It's not like I'm leaving for good.</b>

555
00:30:17,525 --> 00:30:19,596
<b>I do feel a little bad
for leaving...</b>

556
00:30:19,866 --> 00:30:21,165
<b>when your life is hectic.</b>

557
00:30:22,706 --> 00:30:24,435
<b>So you don't know
when you'll be back?</b>

558
00:30:26,236 --> 00:30:27,946
<b>I'll decide...</b>

559
00:30:28,446 --> 00:30:29,446
<b>once I get there.</b>

560
00:30:30,976 --> 00:30:33,676
<b>Okay, then. Be careful.</b>

561
00:30:34,146 --> 00:30:36,015
<b>And report to me
as soon as you get there.</b>

562
00:30:36,685 --> 00:30:38,415
<b>Okay. I'll call you again.</b>

563
00:31:04,515 --> 00:31:05,515
<b>(I took part in a campaign
for abandoned animals.)</b>

564
00:31:05,515 --> 00:31:07,015
<b>You make a living with your image
as the nation's first love.</b>

565
00:31:07,015 --> 00:31:08,446
<b>How can you do that?</b>

566
00:31:08,446 --> 00:31:10,716
<b>Are you happy dating
your dead friend's boyfriend?</b>

567
00:31:10,716 --> 00:31:13,816
<b>Yeo Ha Jin, stop being
so fake, okay?</b>

568
00:31:13,816 --> 00:31:16,325
<b>I'm getting chills.
How can you do that?</b>

569
00:31:17,556 --> 00:31:19,355
<b>They're still the same.</b>

570
00:31:26,895 --> 00:31:28,006
<b>Ha Kyung.</b>

571
00:31:32,806 --> 00:31:33,806
<b>Hey, Ha Kyung.</b>

572
00:31:40,846 --> 00:31:42,846
<b>I had to do something,
so I'm at the office.</b>

573
00:31:42,846 --> 00:31:44,656
<b>Make sure you eat breakfast.</b>

574
00:31:45,115 --> 00:31:47,015
<b>I'll call you in the afternoon
once I'm done with work.</b>

575
00:31:49,556 --> 00:31:51,425
<b>She said she didn't have
any plans today.</b>

576
00:32:07,376 --> 00:32:09,145
<b>What is this? Hey!</b>

577
00:32:09,906 --> 00:32:11,645
<b>You! Hey, you jerk!</b>

578
00:32:12,246 --> 00:32:14,915
<b>Hey! Who are you?</b>

579
00:32:15,816 --> 00:32:17,545
<b>Hey!</b>

580
00:32:18,415 --> 00:32:19,415
<b>Goodness.</b>

581
00:32:36,966 --> 00:32:37,976
<b>Ha Jin.</b>

582
00:32:39,036 --> 00:32:40,705
<b>- Hello.
- Hey, Chul.</b>

583
00:32:41,976 --> 00:32:44,846
<b>Ms. Park told me that
you've been working hard lately.</b>

584
00:32:45,045 --> 00:32:46,915
<b>Gosh, that's the least I could do...</b>

585
00:32:46,915 --> 00:32:48,415
<b>to pay you back.</b>

586
00:32:48,515 --> 00:32:49,985
<b>Yes, keep working hard.</b>

587
00:32:50,585 --> 00:32:53,615
<b>I'm keeping my eyes on you.</b>

588
00:32:53,615 --> 00:32:56,526
<b>Okay. Do you want some coffee?
Or chocolate?</b>

589
00:32:57,156 --> 00:32:58,696
<b>Chocolate. And don't tell Ha Kyung.</b>

590
00:32:59,196 --> 00:33:00,196
<b>Okay.</b>

591
00:33:05,996 --> 00:33:09,265
<b>Director, this is not
what you told me last time.</b>

592
00:33:10,066 --> 00:33:12,936
<b>We were going to make a draft
of the contract for discussion.</b>

593
00:33:12,936 --> 00:33:15,246
<b>Doesn't that mean
we're pretty much in contract?</b>

594
00:33:15,845 --> 00:33:18,475
<b>The least you could've done is
tell me about this beforehand.</b>

595
00:33:18,475 --> 00:33:21,845
<b>No, it's not like
we violated the contract.</b>

596
00:33:22,015 --> 00:33:23,446
<b>You can't suddenly demand penalty.</b>

597
00:33:23,446 --> 00:33:26,085
<b>You can't keep changing
your statement like this.</b>

598
00:33:26,085 --> 00:33:27,926
<b>This is making me very flustered.</b>

599
00:33:29,025 --> 00:33:30,756
<b>What do you mean,
she caused controversy?</b>

600
00:33:31,395 --> 00:33:33,525
<b>Do you think
she's a criminal or something?</b>

601
00:33:37,835 --> 00:33:39,265
<b>What is going on?</b>

602
00:33:39,736 --> 00:33:40,736
<b>Ha Jin.</b>

603
00:33:41,335 --> 00:33:43,066
<b>What penalty charge?</b>

604
00:33:43,965 --> 00:33:45,535
<b>What contract?</b>

605
00:33:47,705 --> 00:33:48,746
<b>Ha Jin.</b>

606
00:33:51,246 --> 00:33:52,345
<b>Let's talk inside.</b>

607
00:33:53,546 --> 00:33:56,515
<b>Please be honest with me.
I have the right to know.</b>

608
00:33:57,085 --> 00:33:59,756
<b>You're right.
There's nothing I can hide.</b>

609
00:34:00,215 --> 00:34:03,285
<b>Since Reporter Park's

00:43:03,526 --> 00:43:06,266
<b>Okay. You should too.</b>

763
00:43:07,735 --> 00:43:10,036
<b>Let's talk again tomorrow.</b>

764
00:43:13,075 --> 00:43:14,205
<b>Goodnight.</b>

765
00:43:16,276 --> 00:43:17,306
<b>Goodnight.</b>

766
00:44:21,676 --> 00:44:22,676
<b>You startled me.</b>

767
00:44:24,005 --> 00:44:25,875
<b>What are you doing in the dark?</b>

768
00:44:26,946 --> 00:44:28,016
<b>Ha Kyung.</b>

769
00:44:33,016 --> 00:44:34,115
<b>Yes, what is it?</b>

770
00:44:37,585 --> 00:44:39,396
<b>I need to go to the States.</b>

771
00:44:41,426 --> 00:44:43,965
<b>I'll do the movie.
Talk to Ms. Park for me.</b>

772
00:44:43,965 --> 00:44:45,636
<b>It's pretty far.</b>

773
00:44:45,636 --> 00:44:47,495
<b>And surviving there won't be easy.</b>

774
00:44:48,536 --> 00:44:49,735
<b>Do you still want to do it?</b>

775
00:44:53,575 --> 00:44:56,406
<b>I think it's the right path for now.</b>

776
00:44:59,276 --> 00:45:00,816
<b>I should go.</b>

777
00:45:15,125 --> 00:45:16,766
<b>Guess who I am.</b>

778
00:45:18,026 --> 00:45:19,436
<b>I can see your shadow.</b>

779
00:45:20,666 --> 00:45:23,205
<b>You're right. How smart.</b>

780
00:45:23,566 --> 00:45:25,205
<b>Aren't you hungry? Let's go and eat.</b>

781
00:45:25,475 --> 00:45:26,475
<b>Sundaetguk?</b>

782
00:45:26,875 --> 00:45:28,136
<b>Was that a lame offer?</b>

783
00:45:28,575 --> 00:45:30,475
<b>- Or back-bone stew?
- I'm going to the States.</b>

784
00:45:30,745 --> 00:45:33,016
<b>Are you going on a trip?
Good for you.</b>

785
00:45:33,016 --> 00:45:34,916
<b>When are you going?
How long is the trip?</b>

786
00:45:35,646 --> 00:45:36,646
<b>Sit down.</b>

787
00:45:42,056 --> 00:45:43,526
<b>It's not a trip.</b>

788
00:45:43,526 --> 00:45:45,426
<b>If I go, it might take years
before I come back.</b>

789
00:45:45,426 --> 00:45:46,896
<b>What do you mean?</b>

790
00:45:46,896 --> 00:45:49,426
<b>My sister is going to film
a movie in the States.</b>

791
00:45:50,465 --> 00:45:52,296
<b>A while ago, she had an offer.</b>

792
00:45:53,365 --> 00:45:56,066
<b>To be honest, things are really bad
for my sister's profession,</b>

793
00:45:56,066 --> 00:45:57,965
<b>so I can't stop her.</b>

794
00:45:58,735 --> 00:46:00,906
<b>Then, how long will you stay there?</b>

795
00:46:01,636 --> 00:46:03,245
<b>I can't give you a definite answer,</b>

796
00:46:04,275 --> 00:46:06,245
<b>but it will take longer than a year.</b>

797
00:46:07,076 --> 00:46:08,646
<b>It could take longer than that.</b>

798
00:46:15,225 --> 00:46:16,656
<b>I know we just started dating.</b>

799
00:46:16,656 --> 00:46:18,055
<b>I'm sorry that I have to leave.</b>

800
00:46:19,926 --> 00:46:22,495
<b>To be honest,
I can't ask you to wait for me.</b>

801
00:46:22,866 --> 00:46:25,235
<b>I'll accept it
if you want to break up.</b>

802
00:46:30,636 --> 00:46:31,936
<b>Do you want to break up with me?</b>

803
00:46:34,805 --> 00:46:36,305
<b>Is that what you want?</b>

804
00:46:37,676 --> 00:46:38,745
<b>No.</b>

805
00:46:41,015 --> 00:46:43,245
<b>- Then, it's all good.
- What's good?</b>

806
00:46:43,245 --> 00:46:45,015
<b>I don't want to break up with you.</b>

807
00:46:45,015 --> 00:46:46,515
<b>And I don't want us to be apart.</b>

808
00:46:46,755 --> 00:46:49,086
<b>- So I'll find a way.
- A way?</b>

809
00:46:49,086 --> 00:46:51,455
<b>I'll go to the States with you.
As a correspondent.</b>

810
00:46:51,856 --> 00:46:54,396
<b>Can you get that position
if you just want it?</b>

811
00:46:54,396 --> 00:46:55,596
<b>Not really.</b>

812
00:46:55,596 --> 00:46:56,926
<b>But a while ago,
they were recruiting...</b>

813
00:46:56,926 --> 00:46:58,225
<b>correspondents to be dispatched
in the States.</b>

814
00:46:58,936 --> 00:47:01,295
<b>Look at that. Perhaps,
we're meant to be together.</b>

815
00:47:01,465 --> 00:47:02,606
<b>It's the perfect timing.</b>

816
00:47:03,235 --> 00:47:05,205
<b>Then, will you get the job
if you apply?</b>

817
00:47:05,676 --> 00:47:07,876
<b>I've never failed at getting a job
after applying for it.</b>

818
00:47:09,475 --> 00:47:10,475
<b>What if you don't get it?</b>

819
00:47:11,946 --> 00:47:13,576
<b>I'll get it. Don't worry.</b>

820
00:47:14,916 --> 00:47:18,686
<b>My gosh. I don't think
it's that simple.</b>

821
00:47:18,686 --> 00:47:20,955
<b>Right. Does Jeong Hoon
know about this?</b>

822
00:47:21,156 --> 00:47:22,755
<b>That Ha Jin is going to the States?</b>

823
00:47:30,795 --> 00:47:35,166
<b>Hi. Ha Kyung. What brings you here?</b>

824
00:47:36,666 --> 00:47:39,876
<b>I'm not sure if you've heard.</b>

825
00:47:41,876 --> 00:47:44,376
<b>My sister is leaving soon.</b>

826
00:47:46,245 --> 00:47:47,346
<b>To the States.</b>

827
00:47:47,676 --> 00:47:48,686
<b>What?</b>

828
00:48:09,465 --> 00:48:11,265
<b>(Anchor Lee)</b>

829
00:48:43,005 --> 00:48:44,005
<b>You're here.</b>

830
00:48:48,336 --> 00:48:50,005
<b>How's the packing going?</b>

831
00:48:52,346 --> 00:48:53,946
<b>Ha Kyung told me.</b>

832
00:48:54,646 --> 00:48:56,146
<b>Why didn't you tell me?</b>

833
00:48:57,086 --> 00:48:58,616
<b>You thought I wouldn't let you go
if you told me?</b>

834
00:49:00,886 --> 00:49:03,826
<b>- I'm very good at waiting.
- Thank you for everything.</b>

835
00:49:09,596 --> 00:49:12,436
<b>Thanks to you, I was very happy.</b>

836
00:49:16,636 --> 00:49:19,836
<b>Those moments with you
were the brightest of my life.</b>

837
00:49:23,176 --> 00:49:25,475
<b>And that will never change.</b>

838
00:49:31,245 --> 00:49:33,156
<b>You won't be able to erase me...</b>

839
00:49:35,455 --> 00:49:37,255
<b>in your memory.</b>

840
00:49:40,725 --> 00:49:43,396
<b>But let our memory
belong in our past.</b>

841
00:49:46,436 --> 00:49:48,065
<b>I promised that...</b>

842
00:49:50,235 --> 00:49:52,676
<b>I would always be there for you
to cheer you on.</b>

843
00:49:56,545 --> 00:49:58,245
<b>But having me by your side...</b>

844
00:50:00,116 --> 00:50:02,846
<b>will make things harder now, right?</b>

845
00:50:08,086 --> 00:50:09,086
<b>Yes.</b>

846
00:50:16,725 --> 00:50:17,995
<b>By being together,</b>

847
00:50:19,666 --> 00:50:21,866
<b>we will only be hurting each other.</b>

848
00:50:28,305 --> 00:50:29,606
<b>This is the right thing to do.</b>

849
00:50:35,946 --> 00:50:37,715
<b>If that's what you want,</b>

850
00:50:38,886 --> 00:50:40,356
<b>let's do that.</b>

851
00:50:52,436 --> 00:50:54,366
<b>I'm going to give it my all.</b>

852
00:50:56,805 --> 00:50:58,205
<b>I want you...</b>

853
00:51:00,505 --> 00:51:03,205
<b>to give it your all too,
so you don't think about me.</b>

854
00:51:09,586 --> 00:51:12,156
<b>I will remember
every moment of you.</b>

855
00:51:19,696 --> 00:51:20,896
<b>Take care.</b>

856
00:51:37,045 --> 00:51:38,505
<b>I won't cry today.</b>

857
00:51:42,715 --> 00:51:45,446
<b>I don't want you...</b>

858
00:51:47,586 --> 00:51:49,686
<b>to remember me with a crying face.</b>

859
00:52:10,475 --> 00:52:12,005
<b>(2 years later)</b>

860
00:52:12,005 --> 00:52:14,015
<b>Gosh, what a day.</b>

861
00:52:21,686 --> 00:52:23,455
<b>Goodness.</b>

862
00:52:23,886 --> 00:52:26,156
<b>- There she is.
- Look. She's here.</b>

863
00:52:26,156 --> 00:52:27,525
<b>- There she is.
- Hey.</b>

864
00:52:27,826 --> 00:52:29,995
<b>Ma'am, it's your first day back
after getting your charge acquitted.</b>

865
00:52:29,995 --> 00:52:30,995
<b>How does it feel?</b>

866
00:52:30,995 --> 00:52:32,596
<b>You were suspected
to have abused your husband.</b>

867
00:52:32,596 --> 00:52:34,666
<b>Things must've been rough
for you. Say something about it.</b>

868
00:52:35,535 --> 00:52:38,906
<b>My innocence was finally proved
in court,</b>

869
00:52:38,906 --> 00:52:39,906
<b>so I'm relieved.</b>

870
00:52:39,906 --> 00:52:42,906
<b>Congratulations on getting
your assault charge acquitted.</b>

871
00:52:45,646 --> 00:52:48,045
<b>I heard you hired
over eight lawyers...</b>

872
00:52:48,045 --> 00:52:50,086
<b>from the biggest law firm in Korea.</b>

873
00:52:50,785 --> 00:52:53,715
<b>You must have formed a dream team.</b>

874
00:52:54,086 --> 00:52:55,886
<b>Mr. Lee Jeong Hoon.</b>

875
00:52:57,055 --> 00:52:58,455
<b>Thank you for your compliment.</b>

876
00:52:58,455 --> 00:53:00,725
<b>By the way,
will you form the same team...</b>

877
00:53:01,025 --> 00:53:03,096
<b>when you get indicted
for a murder charge?</b>

878
00:53:07,366 --> 00:53:08,765
<b>Murder?</b>

879
00:53:08,765 --> 00:53:12,005
<b>On the 23rd of last month,
the day of your 2nd trial,</b>

880
00:53:12,005 --> 00:53:14,975
<b>you hired an illegal detective
agency to introduce...</b>

881
00:53:14,975 --> 00:53:17,576
<b>someone who would do
anything for money.</b>

882
00:53:18,846 --> 00:53:21,275
<b>I don't know where and what kind
of rumors you've heard...</b>

883
00:53:21,275 --> 00:53:24,245
<b>On the night of the 24th, you met
a man the agency introduced to you.</b>

884
00:53:24,245 --> 00:53:26,156
<b>You secretly rendezvoused
with him at work.</b>

885
00:53:26,156 --> 00:53:28,455
<b>And you talked to him
over eight times afterward.</b>

886
00:53:28,755 --> 00:53:32,225
<b>Meanwhile, your husband,
Sim Jae Chul, went missing...</b>

887
00:53:32,225 --> 00:53:36,196
<b>along with the video evidence he was
going to hand over to the judge.</b>

888
00:53:37,196 --> 00:53:38,765
<b>I do not remember doing that.</b>

889
00:53:39,696 --> 00:53:42,565
<b>It hasn't even been two weeks.
There's no way you already forgot.</b>

890
00:53:42,565 --> 00:53:43,936
<b>You can't accuse me...</b>

891
00:53:44,735 --> 00:53:47,436
<b>as a murderer
after I was just found innocent.</b>

892
00:53:49,975 --> 00:53:52,005
<b>Do you really think
you can deal with this?</b>

893
00:53:53,946 --> 00:53:56,916
<b>It's a recording of a whistle-blower
and the call history.</b>

894
00:53:57,245 --> 00:54:00,215
<b>Do you really think
you can deal with this?</b>

895
00:54:02,626 --> 00:54:03,725
<b>There they are.</b>

896
00:54:04,225 --> 00:54:06,696
<b>You can ask them
for the original file.</b>

897
00:54:09,795 --> 00:54:10,896
<b>Ms. Kang.</b>

898
00:54:11,265 --> 00:54:14,495
<b>You're arrested for suspicion of
your husband, Sim Jae Chul's murder.</b>

899
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:16,565
<b>- Arrest her.
- Yes, sir.</b>

900
00:54:17,305 --> 00:54:19,906
<b>I think...
I think there is a misunderstanding.</b>

901
00:54:19,906 --> 00:54:22,275
<b>- No, I didn't.
- Let's go.</b>

902
00:54:22,275 --> 00:54:24,406
<b>Hey, let me go. Take these off.</b>

903
00:54:24,545 --> 00:54:25,545
<b>- Let's go.
- Who do you think you are?</b>

904
00:54:25,545 --> 00:54:27,376
<b>- Wait!
- Let me go!</b>

905
00:54:27,376 --> 00:54:29,245
<b>- What are you doing?
- What's going on?</b>

906
00:54:29,245 --> 00:54:31,186
<b>- Arrested for murder?
- Tell us the details!</b>

907
00:54:31,186 --> 00:54:33,755
<b>- Say something!
- Why did you kill him?</b>

908
00:54:33,755 --> 00:54:36,326
<b>- Do you admit to your crime?
- Tell us more!</b>

909
00:54:36,455 --> 00:54:38,686
<b>- Say something before you go!
- Do you admit?</b>

910
00:54:46,596 --> 00:54:47,636
<b>Jeong Hoon.</b>

911
00:54:48,765 --> 00:54:50,565
<b>You've done something huge again.</b>

912
00:54:50,666 --> 00:54:53,436
<b>It's not the first time
