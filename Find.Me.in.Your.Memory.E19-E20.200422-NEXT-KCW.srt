2
00:00:09,017 --> 00:00:10,317
<b>Hello?</b>

3
00:00:11,147 --> 00:00:12,886
<b>Goodness, Director Song!</b>

4
00:00:12,886 --> 00:00:14,347
<b>One second.</b>

5
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:16,187
<b>What's the occasion?</b>

6
00:00:16,456 --> 00:00:18,316
<b>Wow, it has been so long.</b>

7
00:00:19,056 --> 00:00:20,886
<b>You can hop in first. Go ahead.</b>

8
00:00:22,126 --> 00:00:24,157
<b>It's always the same with us.</b>

9
00:00:44,347 --> 00:00:46,287
<b>Ms. Park will be here
after that phone call.</b>

10
00:00:50,256 --> 00:00:51,317
<b>Okay, sure.</b>

11
00:00:52,627 --> 00:00:53,627
<b>What is this?</b>

12
00:00:54,957 --> 00:00:56,127
<b>Stop that car!</b>

13
00:00:56,226 --> 00:00:58,097
<b>You have to get that car!</b>

14
00:00:58,357 --> 00:00:59,826
<b>- No!
- Wait!</b>

15
00:00:59,826 --> 00:01:02,336
<b>Who do you think you are?</b>

16
00:01:02,436 --> 00:01:04,796
<b>Ha Jin!</b>

17
00:01:14,677 --> 00:01:15,677
<b>Anchor Lee.</b>

18
00:01:15,677 --> 00:01:18,416
<b>Hey. Are you with Ha Jin?</b>

19
00:01:18,416 --> 00:01:20,086
<b>I can't get a hold of her.</b>

20
00:01:21,187 --> 00:01:22,386
<b>She...</b>

21
00:01:23,287 --> 00:01:24,987
<b>She just got abducted.</b>

22
00:01:27,287 --> 00:01:28,356
<b>What?</b>

23
00:01:32,496 --> 00:01:35,327
<b>(Find Me in Your Memory)</b>

24
00:01:50,146 --> 00:01:51,146
<b>Ha Kyung.</b>

25
00:01:52,146 --> 00:01:53,146
<b>Anchor Lee.</b>

26
00:01:54,446 --> 00:01:55,787
<b>What's the situation?</b>

27
00:01:55,787 --> 00:01:58,586
<b>Her phone was turned off
right after the situation broke out,</b>

28
00:01:58,586 --> 00:01:59,687
<b>so we can't track her.</b>

29
00:01:59,687 --> 00:02:01,226
<b>What about her location?</b>

30
00:02:01,226 --> 00:02:02,827
<b>We're tracking down that car.</b>

31
00:02:03,556 --> 00:02:05,996
<b>Are we yet to find out who did this?</b>

32
00:02:05,996 --> 00:02:08,696
<b>We found a security camera nearby
and are looking into it,</b>

33
00:02:08,696 --> 00:02:10,467
<b>but we'll have to see.</b>

34
00:02:10,467 --> 00:02:13,306
<b>And the current suspects,
Ji Hyun Geun and Moon Chul.</b>

35
00:02:13,306 --> 00:02:15,006
<b>We're looking for there whereabouts,</b>

36
00:02:15,006 --> 00:02:16,576
<b>but they're both unreachable.</b>

37
00:02:16,777 --> 00:02:19,176
<b>Goodness, Ha Jin.</b>

38
00:02:19,446 --> 00:02:21,506
<b>- Yes?
- What will happen to her?</b>

39
00:02:21,706 --> 00:02:22,916
<b>You found the car?</b>

40
00:02:23,247 --> 00:02:24,277
<b>Where is it?</b>

41
00:02:32,627 --> 00:02:34,087
<b>- Did you find anything?
- Over here.</b>

42
00:02:39,266 --> 00:02:41,266
<b>I think he changed cars here
and ran away.</b>

43
00:02:43,236 --> 00:02:44,736
<b>Hey. Sir!</b>

44
00:02:44,736 --> 00:02:45,736
<b>What is it?</b>

45
00:02:47,307 --> 00:02:48,407
<b>Darn it.</b>

46
00:02:49,537 --> 00:02:50,537
<b>Hey.</b>

47
00:02:53,446 --> 00:02:54,976
<b>He found a place
with no security camera,</b>

48
00:02:54,976 --> 00:02:56,976
<b>prepared another car to run away in,</b>

49
00:02:56,976 --> 00:02:58,676
<b>and even used anesthetics?</b>

50
00:02:59,046 --> 00:03:01,287
<b>This jerk had this planned.</b>

51
00:03:01,386 --> 00:03:02,386
<b>Take this.</b>

52
00:03:12,527 --> 00:03:14,467
<b>- Yes.
- Where are you?</b>

53
00:03:14,467 --> 00:03:17,097
<b>Do you know what time it is?
Why aren't you at work?</b>

54
00:03:24,777 --> 00:03:25,777
<b>Come in.</b>

55
00:03:28,407 --> 00:03:31,377
<b>What's going on?
Are you coming in just now?</b>

56
00:03:32,446 --> 00:03:35,446
<b>Mr. Kim has been
looking for you everywhere.</b>

57
00:03:35,747 --> 00:03:37,356
<b>I have something to tell you.</b>

58
00:03:37,356 --> 00:03:39,657
<b>What's going on? What is it?</b>

59
00:03:39,657 --> 00:03:41,726
<b>Something happened to Ha Jin.</b>

60
00:03:43,296 --> 00:03:45,256
<b>I think she was
abducted by her stalker.</b>

61
00:03:46,666 --> 00:03:47,666
<b>What?</b>

62
00:03:48,467 --> 00:03:51,497
<b>Are you saying
Ha Jin is abducted right now?</b>

63
00:03:51,497 --> 00:03:53,437
<b>The police are investigating this
behind closed doors.</b>

64
00:03:53,437 --> 00:03:54,867
<b>How long has it been?</b>

65
00:03:55,307 --> 00:03:57,076
<b>Do you have any information?</b>

66
00:03:57,076 --> 00:03:58,476
<b>They're still investigating.</b>

67
00:03:58,476 --> 00:04:00,247
<b>And they don't know
her location yet?</b>

68
00:04:01,006 --> 00:04:02,006
<b>No.</b>

69
00:04:04,747 --> 00:04:06,386
<b>Okay, I understand.</b>

70
00:04:06,817 --> 00:04:08,747
<b>Don't worry about the news and go.</b>

71
00:04:09,157 --> 00:04:11,087
<b>- I'm sorry.
- Hey.</b>

72
00:04:11,557 --> 00:04:13,826
<b>I told you to hurry over.
Why are you here?</b>

73
00:04:13,826 --> 00:04:15,856
<b>- Do you think I'm a joke?
- That's enough!</b>

74
00:04:16,226 --> 00:04:18,027
<b>Why do you always tell me to stop?</b>

75
00:04:18,027 --> 00:04:19,426
<b>What's with you two?</b>

76
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:20,766
<b>I told you to stop.</b>

77
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:23,736
<b>- What's wrong?
- Hurry up and go.</b>

78
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:25,166
<b>Yes, ma'am.</b>

79
00:04:28,267 --> 00:04:29,306
<b>What's going on?</b>

80
00:04:29,707 --> 00:04:30,806
<b>What is it?</b>

81
00:04:31,337 --> 00:04:33,507
<b>Shouldn't he be preparing
for the news?</b>

82
00:04:33,676 --> 00:04:35,707
<b>Jeong Hoon won't be able
to read the news today,</b>

83
00:04:36,847 --> 00:04:38,017
<b>so tell Reporter Cha to do it.</b>

84
00:04:38,017 --> 00:04:39,887
<b>I'm his team leader!</b>

85
00:04:39,887 --> 00:04:42,447
<b>So why can't you tell me
why he can't do it?</b>

86
00:04:42,447 --> 00:04:43,816
<b>Actually,</b>

87
00:04:44,856 --> 00:04:47,387
<b>Ha Jin was abducted by her stalker.</b>

88
00:04:48,257 --> 00:04:49,827
<b>- What?
- The police is investigating it...</b>

89
00:04:49,827 --> 00:04:52,197
<b>behind the closed doors,
so we'll have to wait and see.</b>

90
00:04:52,197 --> 00:04:55,626
<b>Darn it! What kind of a lunatic
would do something like that?</b>

91
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:47,287
<b>Really? Okay, I'll call you back.</b>

92
00:05:47,287 --> 00:05:48,587
<b>- Sir.
- Yes?</b>

93
00:05:48,686 --> 00:05:50,957
<b>Moon Chul lied about
having a drink with a friend...</b>

94
00:05:50,957 --> 00:05:52,926
<b>on the day
of the motorcycle accident.</b>

95
00:05:52,926 --> 00:05:53,926
<b>What?</b>

96
00:05:53,926 --> 00:05:55,827
<b>He wasn't picking up his phone
since yesterday.</b>

97
00:05:55,827 --> 00:05:57,957
<b>I just talked to that friend,</b>

98
00:05:57,957 --> 00:05:59,767
<b>and he said the last time
the two met was over a week ago.</b>

99
00:05:59,767 --> 00:06:02,327
<b>Darn it. I knew
something was fishy about him.</b>

100
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:06,407
<b>I think it was his doing.</b>

101
00:06:06,467 --> 00:06:07,537
<b>Hold on.</b>

102
00:06:09,637 --> 00:06:10,777
<b>It's Ji Hyun Geun.</b>

103
00:06:13,106 --> 00:06:14,147
<b>Hello?</b>

104
00:06:15,676 --> 00:06:17,147
<b>I just got in touch
with Ji Hyun Geun.</b>

105
00:06:17,816 --> 00:06:20,986
<b>According to him, he was
at his studio since last night.</b>

106
00:06:21,186 --> 00:06:22,686
<b>I'm going there right now to check.</b>

107
00:06:25,287 --> 00:06:27,626
<b>We're sorry for disturbing you
when you must be busy.</b>

108
00:06:27,626 --> 00:06:28,757
<b>Thank you for your cooperation.</b>

109
00:06:28,757 --> 00:06:31,796
<b>Not at all.
I'm sorry I didn't pick up sooner.</b>

110
00:06:31,957 --> 00:06:33,726
<b>I'll answer my phone on time
from now on,</b>

111
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:34,866
<b>so call me
whenever you need my help.</b>

112
00:06:34,866 --> 00:06:36,936
<b>- Okay.
- Goodbye.</b>

113
00:06:50,447 --> 00:06:51,777
<b>How did it go?</b>

114
00:06:51,876 --> 00:06:53,447
<b>We looked around,</b>

115
00:06:53,447 --> 00:06:55,046
<b>but we couldn't find
anything suspicious.</b>

116
00:06:55,847 --> 00:06:57,116
<b>I see.</b>

117
00:06:57,116 --> 00:07:00,986
<b>It's become highly likely
that Moon Chul is the culprit.</b>

118
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:04,657
<b>Once we dig deeper,
we'll be able to find a lead.</b>

119
00:07:04,657 --> 00:07:06,226
<b>- So please be patient.
- Okay.</b>

120
00:07:06,226 --> 00:07:09,666
<b>Did you not receive
any suspicious calls?</b>

121
00:07:10,267 --> 00:07:12,337
<b>No, I didn't.</b>

122
00:07:12,436 --> 00:07:15,967
<b>If you do receive any in the future,</b>

123
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:17,577
<b>please let us know.</b>

124
00:07:17,907 --> 00:07:19,007
<b>All right. I'll do that.</b>

125
00:07:19,007 --> 00:07:20,847
<b>- All right. Goodbye.
- Goodbye.</b>

126
00:07:44,837 --> 00:07:45,837
<b>Stop.</b>

127
00:07:47,267 --> 00:07:50,077
<b>I got you, you rat.</b>

128
00:07:50,507 --> 00:07:52,436
<b>Isn't this enough evidence?</b>

129
00:07:52,676 --> 00:07:55,147
<b>Request for an emergency warrant...</b>

130
00:07:55,147 --> 00:07:56,476
<b>and put out an APB for Moon Chul.</b>

131
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,416
<b>Find out which way he drove...</b>

132
00:07:58,416 --> 00:07:59,847
<b>and get his credit card activity.</b>

133
00:07:59,847 --> 00:08:00,847
<b>- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.</b>

134
00:08:03,587 --> 00:08:04,657
<b>Ha Kyung.</b>

135
00:08:05,356 --> 00:08:06,356
<b>Ms. Park.</b>

136
00:08:08,657 --> 00:08:10,556
<b>Are you okay?
Do you want some water?</b>

137
00:08:11,626 --> 00:08:14,397
<b>Did the police call?</b>

138
00:08:16,337 --> 00:08:17,637
<b>No.</b>

139
00:08:23,806 --> 00:08:24,976
<b>Hello, detective.</b>

140
00:08:26,507 --> 00:08:28,707
<b>Chul was at the scene?</b>

141
00:08:29,347 --> 00:08:31,246
<b>Are you saying he's the culprit?</b>

142
00:08:34,616 --> 00:08:37,857
<b>Okay, I'll be waiting for your call.
Goodbye.</b>

143
00:08:39,086 --> 00:08:42,556
<b>Is it Chul?
Did he really abduct her?</b>

144
00:08:43,426 --> 00:08:45,027
<b>They're not certain yet.</b>

145
00:08:45,627 --> 00:08:47,527
<b>They're going
to search his house first.</b>

146
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:50,096
<b>Oh, dear. Poor Ha Jin.</b>

147
00:08:50,966 --> 00:08:52,637
<b>She must be terrified.</b>

148
00:09:49,627 --> 00:09:50,926
<b>- Open it.
- Yes, sir.</b>

149
00:09:58,537 --> 00:09:59,806
<b>There's no one here.</b>

150
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:01,706
<b>I think it's been vacant
for some time.</b>

151
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,737
<b>What? These are all luxury items.</b>

152
00:10:06,107 --> 00:10:07,206
<b>Really?</b>

153
00:10:07,206 --> 00:10:09,277
<b>I'm sure managers don't earn
hefty wages.</b>

154
00:10:09,946 --> 00:10:11,617
<b>- Did you find anything?
- No, sir.</b>

155
00:10:15,517 --> 00:10:16,686
<b>What is this?</b>

156
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:20,556
<b>What is this?</b>

157
00:10:20,556 --> 00:10:23,027
<b>What? It's an earring.</b>

158

<b>This is all your fault.</b>

<b>It's all your fault, Lee Jeong Hoon!</b>

170
00:12:16,806 --> 00:12:17,907
<b>Hey, Tae Eun.</b>

171
00:12:19,037 --> 00:12:22,346
<b>Are you saying her stalker
mimicked Moon Seong Ho?</b>

172
00:12:23,377 --> 00:12:27,086
<b>I think he became more aggressive
as he met with Moon Seong Ho.</b>

173
00:12:30,657 --> 00:12:33,157
<b>Had it not been for me,
he would've never known about him.</b>

174
00:12:34,186 --> 00:12:36,357
<b>Then none of this would've happened.</b>

<b>Don't blame yourself.</b>

176

<b>Even if you weren't involved,</b>

177
00:12:39,096 --> 00:12:40,727
<b>scumbags like him

178

<b>You're also a victim,
so don't be ridiculous.</b>

179

<b>Didn't you say the police
were after her manager?</b>

180
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:50,637
<b>Now that they know their target,
he'll get caught soon.</b>

<b>There's something unsettling

<b>It's hard to explain.</b>

184
00:13:00,316 --> 00:13:01,716
<b>But I've always felt this way.</b>

185
00:13:02,617 --> 00:13:05,186
<b>He reminds me of Moon Seong Ho.</b>

186
00:13:07,127 --> 00:13:10,127
<b>After seeing Moon Seong Ho recently,
this feeling became even stronger.</b>

187
00:13:10,426 --> 00:13:11,826
<b>Did you tell this to the police?</b>

188
00:13:14,267 --> 00:13:15,966
<b>It's just a feeling that I have.</b>

189
00:13:18,267 --> 00:13:20,737
<b>If all the evidence they found
point to Moon Chul,</b>

190
00:13:20,737 --> 00:13:22,267
<b>then he must be the culprit.</b>

191
00:13:25,176 --> 00:13:27,576
<b>Is this Ms. Yeo's earring?</b>

192
00:13:28,676 --> 00:13:29,816
<b>Are you looking for something?</b>

193
00:13:29,946 --> 00:13:31,576
<b>I can't find the other one.</b>

194
00:13:31,576 --> 00:13:33,117
<b>Didn't you keep them together?</b>

195

<b>I thought I did,
but I can't find one of them.</b>

196

<b>This would've been perfect.</b>

197
00:13:39,926 --> 00:13:42,987
<b>Yes, it is. She lost it a while ago.</b>

198
00:13:43,997 --> 00:13:45,627
<b>We found it at Moon Chul's place.</b>

199
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:49,027
<b>He must've been sneaking
into your house for some time now.</b>

200
00:13:50,637 --> 00:13:53,206
<b>We were like family,
so it must've been easy.</b>

201
00:13:53,836 --> 00:13:55,737
<b>He knew the passcode as well.</b>

202

203

<b>or his close friends?</b>

206

<b>Do you know whom he'd visit
during this situation?</b>

207
00:14:10,117 --> 00:14:12,086
<b>He said his parents lived
in Gangwon Province.</b>

208
00:14:12,257 --> 00:14:15,086
<b>He said it was a very rural area
and that I wouldn't know.</b>

209
00:14:15,956 --> 00:14:18,027
<b>He could be hiding there.</b>

210
00:14:18,027 --> 00:14:21,666
<b>Call his parents and ask

<b>Yes, they're very pretty.</b>

484
00:38:09,216 --> 00:38:10,915
<b>Anyway, it feels like...</b>

<b>what happened yesterday night

<b>A really bad nightmare.</b>

487
00:38:16,425 --> 00:38:19,656
<b>Yes, let's just think of that

488
00:38:19,656 --> 00:38:21,026
<b>and forget all about it.</b>

489
00:38:21,725 --> 00:38:23,066
<b>I should do that.</b>

490

495
00:38:38,805 --> 00:38:40,146
<b>You should call him.</b>

00:40:13,136 --> 00:40:16,375
<b>Yes. Hey, I forgot to call you.</b>

507

508
00:40:17,446 --> 00:40:20,115
<b>Of course, you were out of it.</b>

509

<b>When you have some time,

514

<b>You said you were a good doctor.</b>

515

<b>All right, man.</b>

516

<b>And let me know

<b>Yes, I will call you,

518
00:40:41,896 --> 00:40:45,235
<b>All right, then. I'm glad

519
00:40:45,235 --> 00:40:46,636
<b>Okay. I'll call you again.</b>

<b>Look at smiling

524

<b>when he came for the interview,

526
00:41:17,836 --> 00:41:20,935
<b>I did think he was extraordinary,</b>

<b>Let me burn them all.</b>

<b>I already got rid of that.</b>

532

<b>Ha Jin must've been shocked.</b>

533

<b>She probably worked very hard for
months filming that movie with him.</b>

<b>Should I call her?</b>

539
00:41:49,136 --> 00:41:50,535
<b>Call who? Jeong Hoon?</b>

540
00:41:50,535 --> 00:41:52,675
<b>No, Ha Jin. I'm worried about her.</b>

541
00:41:52,675 --> 00:41:55,605
<b>She probably has no time for that.
Let her get some rest.</b>

542

<b>We can ask Jeong Hoon later

<b>You're going to visit her alone

<b>You can't do that.

<b>Why? Are you jealous

<b>Hey, you're really jealous.</b>

552
00:42:22,395 --> 00:42:23,865
<b>Don't look at me like that.</b>

<b>- Could you?
- Sure.</b>

661
00:48:25,096 --> 00:48:26,466
<b>Why are you here?</b>

662
00:48:26,466 --> 00:48:29,436
<b>I'm visiting her. And you?</b>

00:48:29,436 --> 00:48:31,206
<b>Me too, you punk.</b>

664
00:48:32,135 --> 00:48:34,475
<b>I was worried about her.</b>

665
00:48:34,475 --> 00:48:35,875
<b>Are you feeling okay?</b>

666
00:48:35,875 --> 00:48:39,206
<b>Yes, I am.
Thank you for your concern.</b>

667
00:48:39,306 --> 00:48:41,346
<b>I'm glad you look well.</b>

668

<b>By the way, whose birthday is it?</b>

669
00:48:43,846 --> 00:48:45,615
<b>It's yours?</b>

670
00:48:45,615 --> 00:48:49,485
<b>Gosh, had I known earlier,
I would've prepared a gift.</b>

671
00:48:51,155 --> 00:48:53,495
<b>Why isn't Jeong Hoon here?</b>

672
00:48:54,355 --> 00:48:56,765
<b>I came here alone
because he wasn't at work.</b>

673
00:49:05,005 --> 00:49:06,036
<b>Hey.</b>

674
00:49:06,105 --> 00:49:07,176
<b>Hello.</b>

675
00:49:07,875 --> 00:49:09,005
<b>What happened to your face?</b>

676
00:49:10,046 --> 00:49:11,676
<b>Did he beat you up?</b>

677
00:49:11,676 --> 00:49:14,115
<b>What? Of course, not.</b>

678
00:49:14,316 --> 00:49:16,586
<b>I was being careless
and ran into something.</b>

679
00:49:16,586 --> 00:49:19,416
<b>Go to my office.
I'll be there soon.</b>

680
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:20,655
<b>Okay.</b>

681
00:49:25,655 --> 00:49:27,225
<b>You went to the pharmacy?</b>

682
00:49:27,855 --> 00:49:32,125
<b>Hey, you should take better care
of your face.</b>

683
00:49:32,125 --> 00:49:34,235
<b>Why would you walk around
and show it off?</b>

684
00:49:34,235 --> 00:49:37,036
<b>It's not bad.
I even got free ointment.</b>

685
00:49:38,765 --> 00:49:39,775
<b>Seeing how you're joking around,</b>

686
00:49:39,775 --> 00:49:41,405
<b>you're finally back
to being yourself.</b>

687
00:49:42,806 --> 00:49:44,505
<b>I heard Ha Jin is hospitalized.</b>

688
00:49:44,806 --> 00:49:46,475
<b>Did she get hurt?</b>

689
00:49:46,775 --> 00:49:49,015
<b>Fortunately, she's well.</b>

690
00:49:49,316 --> 00:49:50,446
<b>But she must've been shocked.</b>

691
00:49:50,446 --> 00:49:53,515
<b>You're right.
She'll need time to recover.</b>

692
00:49:54,385 --> 00:49:57,056
<b>I'm truly glad
that she's safe and sound.</b>

693
00:49:57,826 --> 00:49:58,826
<b>Me too.</b>

694
00:49:59,286 --> 00:50:01,556
<b>I'm trying my best to cover for you.</b>

695
00:50:03,225 --> 00:50:06,395
<b>But I don't think the higher-ups
will let you off the hook.</b>

696
00:50:07,635 --> 00:50:10,666
<b>No matter what the reason may be,
you did bail on the news.</b>

697
00:50:12,566 --> 00:50:14,005
<b>I know.</b>

698
00:50:14,005 --> 00:50:15,605
<b>Will you be okay today?</b>

699
00:50:16,005 --> 00:50:19,475
<b>You'll have to read news
about Ha Jin.</b>

700
00:50:19,875 --> 00:50:20,875
<b>I'll do it.</b>

701
00:50:21,446 --> 00:50:22,475
<b>Thank you...</b>

702
00:50:23,385 --> 00:50:25,145
<b>for letting me off the hook

703

<b>and for yesterday as well.</b>

704
00:50:28,056 --> 00:50:30,056
<b>I'll come to my senses and do well.</b>

705
00:50:30,056 --> 00:50:31,456
<b>Forget it.</b>

706
00:50:32,326 --> 00:50:35,826
<b>Tell the makeup artist
to cover that up well.</b>

707
00:50:37,465 --> 00:50:38,496
<b>Okay.</b>

708
00:50:38,665 --> 00:50:39,766
<b>You may leave.</b>

709
00:50:39,766 --> 00:50:41,695
<b>- I'll be going, then.
- Okay.</b>

710
00:50:42,236 --> 00:50:44,036
<b>- Hey.
- Thank you.</b>

711
00:50:53,816 --> 00:50:56,816
<b>- Hey, you were here.
- Yes.</b>

712

<b>Did you watch the news

713
00:50:59,546 --> 00:51:00,786
<b>It was a good one.</b>

714
00:51:02,486 --> 00:51:05,385
<b>Who taught you to reveal
a culprit's identity like that?</b>

00:51:05,385 --> 00:51:07,125
<b>Whom do you think?</b>

716
00:51:07,125 --> 00:51:10,465
<b>I'm your one and only junior.</b>

717

<b>The entire world ought to know

<b>You two must be close.</b>

720

<b>Of course. I just got back

<b>Yes, I went with Ha Kyung...</b>

723

<b>I visited the hospital

00:54:19,885 --> 00:54:22,385
<b>(Inmate Moon Seong Ho)</b>

772
00:54:29,125 --> 00:54:31,566
<b>So are you going
to start afresh with Yeo Ha Jin?</b>

773
00:54:37,736 --> 00:54:39,236
<b>I can't let you do that.</b>

774
00:54:44,905 --> 00:54:45,905
<b>Here.</b>

775
00:54:47,675 --> 00:54:50,046
<b>Now, tell me. What is this about?</b>

776
00:54:52,046 --> 00:54:53,046
<b>What do you mean?</b>

777
00:54:53,046 --> 00:54:56,385
<b>You keep saying you're fine today,
but I can tell you're sad.</b>

778
00:54:56,385 --> 00:54:57,756
<b>What's wrong?</b>

779
00:55:03,766 --> 00:55:05,195
<b>Are you still scared?</b>

780
00:55:06,465 --> 00:55:08,195
<b>Are you still anxious?</b>

781
00:55:08,596 --> 00:55:09,596
<b>Is that it?</b>

782
00:55:10,465 --> 00:55:13,276
<b>It's all over now.
You don't have to worry now.</b>

783
00:55:15,836 --> 00:55:18,276
<b>I think it's really over now.</b>

784
00:55:19,076 --> 00:55:20,076
<b>What?</b>

785
00:55:21,246 --> 00:55:22,976
<b>I think I have become...</b>

786
00:55:24,046 --> 00:55:26,185
<b>his past to Anchor Lee now.</b>

787
00:55:29,855 --> 00:55:32,086
<b>He had been nice to me
all this time...</b>

788
00:55:32,086 --> 00:55:33,996
<b>because of the stalker.</b>

789
00:55:35,695 --> 00:55:37,566
<b>Now, he doesn't need
to worry about me.</b>

790
00:55:39,996 --> 00:55:42,365
<b>I'm afraid he might leave me again
and wish me happiness.</b>

791
00:55:43,665 --> 00:55:46,365
<b>Is that why you didn't call him
and have been moping around all day?</b>

792
00:55:47,605 --> 00:55:48,605
<b>Yes.</b>

793
00:55:49,375 --> 00:55:50,605
<b>I'm afraid.</b>

794
00:55:53,816 --> 00:55:55,276
<b>Why don't we get some fresh air?</b>

795
00:55:58,086 --> 00:55:59,915
<b>Doesn't it feel suffocating
to stay indoors?</b>

796
00:56:00,115 --> 00:56:01,115
<b>Let's go for a walk.</b>

797
00:56:03,286 --> 00:56:04,286
<b>Okay.</b>

798
00:56:10,865 --> 00:56:12,625
<b>This feels nice.</b>

799
00:56:12,625 --> 00:56:14,865
<b>The view here is
better than I thought.</b>

800
00:56:17,205 --> 00:56:19,766
<b>How do you feel? Do you feel
better with some fresh air?</b>

801
00:56:19,836 --> 00:56:20,836
<b>Yes.</b>

802
00:56:21,336 --> 00:56:23,645
<b>I think I'll feel much better
with some tteokbokki.</b>

803
00:56:23,645 --> 00:56:25,445
<b>What are you talking about?
No tteokbokki.</b>

804
00:56:25,445 --> 00:56:27,415
<b>- How about fried chicken?
- No fried chicken.</b>

805
00:56:27,715 --> 00:56:29,945
<b>My gosh, I feel so sad.</b>

806
00:56:29,945 --> 00:56:32,286
<b>You feel sad?
Fresh air will lift your spirit.</b>

807
00:56:32,286 --> 00:56:33,915
<b>It's chilly here.
Let me get some blankets.</b>

808
00:56:33,915 --> 00:56:35,016
<b>Just order some food for me.</b>

809
00:56:35,016 --> 00:56:36,855
<b>How about a run around here?
It'll put us in a good mood.</b>

810
00:56:36,855 --> 00:56:37,855
<b>Get the blanket.</b>

811
00:56:37,855 --> 00:56:39,986
<b>Okay. I'll be quick. Wait here.</b>

812
00:56:53,705 --> 00:56:54,935
<b>You're back already?</b>

813
00:56:58,346 --> 00:56:59,776
<b>Are you feeling okay?</b>

814
00:57:00,516 --> 00:57:02,615
<b>I didn't call you because I wanted
you to rest up without distractions.</b>

815
00:57:06,086 --> 00:57:08,355
<b>What is it? Did something happen?</b>

816
00:57:08,986 --> 00:57:12,455
<b>How could you not call me once today
after leaving me this morning?</b>

817
00:57:14,155 --> 00:57:15,996
<b>Do you know how long
I waited for your call?</b>

818
00:57:17,195 --> 00:57:21,465
<b>I see. I didn't think
that you'd be waiting for my call.</b>

819
00:57:22,435 --> 00:57:24,506
<b>I had to take care of something.
I was distracted.</b>

820
00:57:41,486 --> 00:57:42,816
<b>It's your birthday present.</b>

821
00:57:46,925 --> 00:57:48,655
<b>I didn't know what to get you.</b>

822
00:57:48,655 --> 00:57:50,596
<b>So it took me some time
to pick out a present for you.</b>

823
00:57:50,865 --> 00:57:52,895
<b>I hope you like it.</b>

824
00:57:55,266 --> 00:57:57,665
<b>You left to buy my present?</b>

825
00:57:58,665 --> 00:57:59,705
<b>Yes.</b>

826
00:58:02,476 --> 00:58:03,776
<b>Won't you open it?</b>

827
00:58:18,955 --> 00:58:20,796
<b>What are all these?</b>

828
00:58:21,125 --> 00:58:23,355
<b>You don't get to sleep well
because of your nightmares.</b>

829
00:58:23,826 --> 00:58:25,826
<b>They help you sleep better.</b>

830
00:58:26,226 --> 00:58:28,465
<b>I wanted you to sleep well
without any nightmares.</b>

831
00:58:31,705 --> 00:58:33,605
<b>Picking out one was harder,</b>

832
00:58:33,605 --> 00:58:35,236
<b>so I decided to go for the quantity.</b>

833
00:58:39,776 --> 00:58:41,915
<b>What is it? Do you not like them?</b>

834
00:58:44,385 --> 00:58:46,246
<b>No, I like them.</b>

835
00:58:47,955 --> 00:58:50,425
<b>I was touched. I'm very thankful.</b>

836
00:58:51,556 --> 00:58:54,296
<b>But you don't look like
you're touched.</b>

837
00:58:55,056 --> 00:58:57,695
<b>I'm really touched, but...</b>

838
00:58:58,195 --> 00:58:59,195
<b>But?</b>

839
00:59:00,336 --> 00:59:01,665
<b>I'm afraid...</b>

840
00:59:03,536 --> 00:59:05,105
<b>that this might be the end.</b>

841
00:59:06,905 --> 00:59:09,976
<b>We started this because
of my one-sided crush on you.</b>

842
00:59:11,246 --> 00:59:13,476
<b>And then, we realized
there was a stalker.</b>

843
00:59:15,415 --> 00:59:17,286
<b>You were worried about me,</b>

844
00:59:17,286 --> 00:59:20,286
<b>so you were taking care of me
in case something happened to me.</b>

845
00:59:22,756 --> 00:59:24,655
<b>But now that he's arrested,</b>

846
00:59:26,786 --> 00:59:28,655
<b>it's really over.</b>

847
00:59:32,865 --> 00:59:34,536
<b>I'm scared that
you'll be nice to the end...</b>

848
00:59:34,536 --> 00:59:37,066
<b>and say goodbye
like the other time.</b>

849
00:59:40,875 --> 00:59:43,375
<b>Is that what this is?</b>

850
00:59:49,445 --> 00:59:51,046
<b>I won't say goodbye to you.</b>

851
00:59:53,346 --> 00:59:55,715
<b>I won't be saying goodbye
to you from now on.</b>

852
00:59:59,026 --> 01:00:00,026
<b>Why not?</b>

853
01:00:03,195 --> 01:00:05,096
<b>I want to stay by your side now.</b>

854
01:00:09,395 --> 01:00:11,405
<b>So you don't have to worry.</b>

855
01:00:19,246 --> 01:00:21,016
<b>You can't take that back.</b>

856
01:00:24,215 --> 01:00:25,645
<b>That's a promise, okay?</b>

857
01:00:27,816 --> 01:00:28,955
<b>I promise you.</b>

858
01:00:43,665 --> 01:00:44,935
<b>Happy birthday.</b>

859
01:02:04,546 --> 01:02:06,715
<b>(Find Me in Your Memory)</b>

860
01:02:06,816 --> 01:02:08,756
<b>What were you doing?
Were you thinking about me?</b>

861
01:02:08,756 --> 01:02:10,655
<b>Square your shoulders.</b>

862
01:02:10,855 --> 01:02:12,455
<b>Straighten your back.</b>

863
01:02:12,455 --> 01:02:13,955
<b>We should have a proper first date.</b>

864
01:02:13,955 --> 01:02:15,556
<b>Let's officially go on a date
this weekend.</b>

865
01:02:15,556 --> 01:02:17,226
<b>People will recognize us.</b>

866
01:02:17,226 --> 01:02:19,425
<b>They can watch us if they want.
We don't have to hide.</b>

867
01:02:19,425 --> 01:02:22,296
<b>How could you meet someone new
as if it's not a big deal?</b>

868
01:02:22,296 --> 01:02:23,766
<b>That's why it's fate.</b>

869
01:02:23,766 --> 01:02:25,836
<b>We are destined
to meet and fall in love.</b>

870
01:02:25,836 --> 01:02:27,605
<b>Because of you, Ha Jin's memory
might come back.</b>

871
01:02:27,605 --> 01:02:30,135
<b>I don't want to regret
any of the time I have left.</b>

872
01:02:30,135 --> 01:02:31,506
<b>What are you thinking?</b>

873
01:02:31,506 --> 01:02:32,905
<b>Grant me a wish too.</b>

874
01:02:32,905 --> 01:02:34,945
<b>Whatever situation we may be in,</b>

875
01:02:34,945 --> 01:02:37,415
<b>let's never say
goodbye to each other.</b>
