00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,870
JEONG TAE-EUL
NATIONAL POLICE AGENCY

2
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:43,300
What the hell

3
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,680
do you think you're doing right now?

4
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:48,180
I've

5
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:52,770
finally met you,

6
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:56,270
Lieutenant Jeong Tae-eul.

7
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,630
What are you doing?
Are you out of your mind?

8
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:28,390
Can't you see my ID card?

9
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:30,100
I'm a police officer. What are you doing?

10
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:32,180
That was a greeting.

11
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:34,810
-What?
-Because I'm happy to see you.

12
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:37,020
So, you were across the universe.

13
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:41,320
You really existed.

14
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,150
And after 25 years,
you're still a lieutenant.

15
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:51,740
LIEUTENANT JEONG TAE-EUL
BIRTHDATE: MAY 27TH, 1990

16
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:57,290
How do you know my rank?

17
00:01:57,370 --> 00:01:58,960
I have been watching you for a long time.

18
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:00,710
Although you may not believe me.

19
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:02,710
If you knew I wouldn't believe you,
why would you say such bullshit?

20
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,800
I will ask you again, sir.

21
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:07,840
Show me your ID.

22
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,680
I'm afraid I can't.

23
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:13,100
-I don't have an ID.
-Why do you not have an ID?

24
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:14,270
Because I am

25
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:15,930
who I am.

26
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:19,600
I guess you won't believe this either.

27
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:22,570
What the...

28
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:25,780
It seems that my feelings are conveyed,
and you are confused,

29
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:28,110
so I will sum up the current situation.

30
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:30,700
I am the King of the Kingdom of Corea.

31
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:33,530
I crossed the dimension
with lightning and thunder

32
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:36,250
while chasing after a suspicious person
and arrived here.

33
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:38,660
I was confused for a while,

34
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,880
but after giving it some thought,

35
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:44,840
I came to the conclusion
that this is a parallel universe.

36
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,630
This is a parallel universe?

37
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,430
It is a bit different,
but let's not get into the details.

38
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,180
There's already one thing

39
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,010
that makes a big difference.

40
00:02:58,390 --> 00:02:59,890
QUEEN YUNA
THE BEGINNING OF A NEW LEGEND

41
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:03,190
It seems that this country
is ruled by a Queen in this universe.

42
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:05,650
And she seems to be pretty beloved.

43
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:08,610
We do love our Queen Yuna.

44
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,030
She's loved by the whole nation.

45
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:12,450
Just like I am.

46
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:16,120
Now, escort me to your Queen

47
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,200
and give well-dried grass and water
to Maximus,

48
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,540
my seventh-grade official.

49
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:22,750
How am I supposed to take you

50
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:23,920
to Queen Yuna?

51
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:25,960
You've got to buy a ticket.

52
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:30,720
There seems to be something wrong
with our conversation.

53
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:34,600
-Am I right?
-Now you're talking sense.

54
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:36,430
This is annoying.

55
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:38,270
He must be a movie star.

56
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:43,520
-He must be a celebrity.
-Take a picture of his face.

57
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,900
So, you're saying

58
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:54,620
you came from a parallel universe,

59
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,790
where you are
the King of the Kingdom of Corea.

60
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:01,290
And there was lightning on your way here.

61
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,130
And the horse is a seventh-grade official.

62
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,960
Is that what you're saying now?

63
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,550
It looks like you don't understand
what a parallel universe is.

64
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:12,300
Did you not study science?

65
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:16,350
Who is this half-crazy bastard?

66
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:21,640
Is this what your personality is like?

67
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:23,140
Yes.

68
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:27,150
My personality has been like this
for about 30 years now.

69
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:28,520
Why?

70
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:30,740
I have never imagined it.

71
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:34,320
I thought you would rather be softer...

72
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:37,410
This is new.

73
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:38,910
Sure.

74
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:40,750
Enough with the self-introduction.

75
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,710
Let me introduce myself now.

76
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:50,760
You didn't show me your ID,
you violated the traffic law,

77
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:55,050
and you touched the body
of a police officer on duty. Right?

78
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:00,010
You have the right to an attorney,
and you have the right to remain silent.

79
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:02,350
If you move, it will only hurt more.

80
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:09,570
I am the King of the Kingdom of Corea--

81
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,230
My arm.

82
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:12,440
My arm.

83
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:14,570
EPISODE 2

84
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:16,200
FORENSIC SERVICE

85
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:24,370
-What a handsome white horse.
-What is it?

86
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:26,290
-What's going on?
-It looks so pretty.

87
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:27,370
It makes a great photo.

88
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,090
-Where did you come from?
-What's going on?

89
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:30,880
-It looks great.
-It makes a great photo.

90
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,170
-I haven't seen a real white horse.
-What's this?

91
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:37,220
Let me ask you again.

92
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,100
What's your name?

93
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:43,640
I can tell you,
but you cannot call me by that.

94
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,390
That's my answer again.

95
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:47,440
The name is not supposed to be called.

96
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,400
Then let's say it's Kim Gae-ddong
for convenience's sake.

97
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,860
"Gae-ddong" as in dog poop?

98
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:56,320
You could have called me
Hong Gil-dong or Mr. so-and-so.

99
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,660
And my family name isn't even Kim...

100
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:01,240
Mr. Kim Gae-ddong,
take out all your belongings

101
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:02,410
and put them here.

102
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:05,160
If you disobey the order,
I will take them out myself.

103
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:17,840
I will check your belongings.

104
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:21,430
THE KINGDOM OF COREA

105
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,730
Right, it was there too.

106
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:33,980
Think of it as the concern

107
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:37,570
of the Head Court Lady
over the Royal Ancestral Shrine.

108
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,370
A 100 thousand won?

109
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:50,880
What's wrong? Don't you guys
have 100 thousand won bills here?

110
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,210
Did you play Monopoly yesterday?

111
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,340
-Did you get to buy much land?
-Will you keep talking down to me?

112
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,460
Kim Gae-ddong has been talking down to me
since Gwanghwamun.

113
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:57,840
I'm three years older than you.

114
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,380
Does that matter right now?

115
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:01,590
Goodness. It looks quite real.

116
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:06,310
There's a chance that this can be
involved in crimes or fraud,

117
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:08,560
so I'm seizing it.

118
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:14,900
-When will we get the result?
-In about two hours.

119
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,320
Bring it to the office.

120
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,990
Okay. I'll bring it to you straight away.

121
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:24,070
What's that?

122
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:27,950
You don't have an ID,
you failed to identify yourself,

123
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,790
and you've been uncooperative with police.
You know that, right?

124
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:33,540
I need your cooperation
with the fingerprint identification.

125
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,380
No one is allowed to touch my body.
Even you--

126
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:46,600
Don't think that you just overpowered me.

127
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,770
I have trained my body
with all kinds of exercises.

128
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,440
You seem to not believe me.

129
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:54,900
I wish I get to prove it.

130
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:58,070
Rowing, horse-riding,
taekwondo, fencing, boxing...

131
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,750
His Majesty went out again?

132
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,960
Yes.

133
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:20,340
He went out without permission again
in the early evening.

134
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:22,550
I thought so since my security level

135
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,390
has been elevated.

136
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,050
Where has he gone this time?

137
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:29,390
Did he go see the ice cap again?

138
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,060
No, not there.

139
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:33,270
He left all his winter clothes.

140
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:37,440
This time, I have no clue.

141
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:41,570
Captain Jo assumes that he disappeared

142
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:44,780
through the bamboo forest
near the racetracks.

143
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:51,950
Just until this summer,
he was shameless about running away.

144
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,540
This is no laughing matter.

145
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:58,500
You should really knock some sense
into him this time.

146
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:01,170
Don't ask him if he had fun this time.

147
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,720
But that's my biggest interest.

148
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:06,180
So, what should we say this time?

149
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,640
We've already used acute gastritis

150
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:11,310
and acne caused by the change of season.

151
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:18,110
Why don't you use the method
that you used a year ago?

152
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:19,730
Let's say he cooped himself up
in his study

153
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:22,740
because he has math fever again.

154
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:26,950
Let's say he even has the Prince over
to help him solve math problems.

155
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,700
I guess I should stay here
for a few hours.

156
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:33,870
Looks like we will have
another rush of applicants

157
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:35,040
for science and engineering.

158
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,500
This is so frustrating.

159
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:43,300
Captain Jo said he's searching,
so let's hope he finds something.

160
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:03,980
The CCTVs caught him pass by
the sixth point but not the seventh point.

161
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,700
The only thing that is between the two
is this bamboo forest

162
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:09,620
but the footprints stop here.

163
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:15,370
It means he disappeared here,

164
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,500
which makes no sense.

165
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,960
I will check the CCTV footage again
to make sure we didn't miss anything

166
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,210
and search again.

167
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:23,250
Right.

168
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:24,380
That makes sense.

169
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:28,720
It's either you missed something,
or I missed what you missed.

170
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:31,800
You two take care of it.
Just the two of you.

171
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:33,680
-You know what I mean.
-Yes.

172
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,230
I will be on outside duty,
so call me to keep me updated.

173
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,310
Right.

174
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:44,360
You said His Majesty went to check
if it's a clock or rabbit, right?

175
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:45,780
Yes.

176
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:48,280
Seriously, we are innocent.

177
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:52,410
We had no idea that His Majesty was there.

178
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:54,830
We were just trying to catch the bitch
that ran away with our boss' money

179
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:55,990
and ended up there.

180
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,410
-That's what happened.
-Hey.

181
00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:01,420
That bitch doesn't have
a home nor does she have an identity.

182
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,170
We must get her while she's in our sight.
Otherwise, we can't.

183
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:06,920
Please be generous.

184
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:08,550
You see, we did some investigation

185
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:12,890
and what they said
mostly correspond to what happened.

186
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:15,220
-Did you find the woman they were chasing?
-Not yet.

187
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:17,060
We have our eyes on her too

188
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:20,190
because she's committed
various crimes like theft and assault.

189
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:22,730
But we don't know her face nor name.

190
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:25,480
We rather got tips from these guys.

191
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:26,900
What is she called again?

192
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:28,030
-Luna.
-Luna.

193
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:29,570
Luna, it is.

194
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:31,860
I will call you as soon as we catch her.

195
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:34,450
Please prepare
the CCTV footage of her as well.

196
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:35,410
I will.

197
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:36,330
Hey.

198
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:39,500
Hey.

199
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:42,210
Give me a cushion to sit on.

200
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:43,750
Or at least a chair.

201
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:47,050
I have never sat on the floor before.

202
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:51,680
I know you can hear me.

203
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,050
Is he the person you talked about?
Prince Charming?

204
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:12,780
JO EUN-SUP

205
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:23,250
Yeong.

206
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:25,460
Isn't that you, Yeong?

207
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:27,210
What's your problem?

208
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:31,380
I'm here.

209
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:32,470
This way.

210
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:36,760
He says he's not a prince but a king.

211
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:39,100
-He says he can't sit on the floor.
-I see.

212
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:40,520
See? I knew you could hear me.

213
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:48,650
Yeong, I had no idea
that you would follow me.

214
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:50,230
He's a little scary.

215
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,450
Director Jeong asked me
to pass this to Squad Three.

216
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:55,360
This...

217
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,240
is for the delivery.

218
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:04,790
He's not

219
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:07,500
Yeong.

220
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,380
He's not.

221
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:13,340
Yeong? You kept saying that name.
Who is that?

222
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:14,550
My name is Jo Eun-sup.

223
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:17,430
Why do you answer him? Don't talk to him.

224
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:20,010
One should not ignore what others say.

225
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,770
There is a horse outside.

226
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:24,270
It was one dashing horse.

227
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:27,100
Are you the owner of the horse?

228
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:31,610
He's like King Arthur.
King Arthur rides a white horse, you know.

229
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:33,610
I loved that cartoon.

230
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:35,070
Did you see it?

231
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:37,160
Wait.

232
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,540
My, look at that watch.

233
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:42,490
What is it?

234
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:48,710
At least you have good taste.

235
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:52,590
It's the only watch in this world
that was made

236
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:55,920
to celebrate the first victory
of Maximus, my fine horse.

237
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:57,380
Right.

238
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:59,220
There are two worlds now.

239
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:03,060
It's the only watch in two worlds.

240
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,310
Yeong would have recognized right away

241
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,520
that the accurate watch
doesn't go faster or slower

242
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:11,110
even by one-tenth of a second.

243
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:13,230
I get it.

244
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:15,320
He talks with elegance
just like his horse.

245
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,530
I wish my horses were as elegant.

246
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:20,660
-I do have horses too, you know.
-You do?

247
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:23,120
Horseradish, sawhorse,

248
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,250
Red Horse.

249
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,040
Eun-sup.

250
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:32,750
It's seven already. Aren't you going home?

251
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,010
Wait.

252
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,800
I didn't want to say this,

253
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:43,310
but please lay it
on at least a piece of paper.

254
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:46,270
It has never been laid on the floor.

255
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:48,060
He seems pretty ill.

256
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:50,850
This is why I told you not to talk to him.

257
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:53,320
I should get going.

258
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:00,450
FORENSICS TEAM, GYEONG-RAN

259
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:02,700
You can't find his identity? At all?

260
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:05,740
Are you saying he's an unidentified man?

261
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:07,580
Even those who aren't registered anymore
have records.

262
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:10,210
I know. But we found nothing.

263
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:13,500
I haven't seen any adult over 30
whose fingerprints aren't registered.

264
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,630
It's a rare case,
but there's a chance that he was a child

265
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:19,760
that went missing
before registering his fingerprints.

266
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:24,180
Take his DNA sample and send it
to the Women and Juvenile Division.

267
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:26,770
And I will have to take a look
at the flier once again.

268
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:29,940
I don't know who made it,
but it looks like real money.

269
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:31,190
Good luck.

270
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:33,310
Okay, bye.

271
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:37,070
Gosh, I dug my own grave.

272
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,320
Seriously, who are you?

273
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:43,320
Open your mouth.

274
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:51,920
You tried to identify my fingerprints,

275
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:54,170
but you failed to identify me.

276
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:56,250
Is that right?

277
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,800
It means

278
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:00,670
I don't exist in this world

279
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:05,850
and the two worlds
aren't exactly the same.

280
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,140
Will you keep talking nonsense?

281
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:13,900
-I said, "Open your mouth."
-Just like I don't exist here,

282
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,980
you didn't exist in my world either.

283
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:18,900
It took me a while to find you
and some effort to confirm it.

284
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,400
Your affiliation was questionable

285
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:24,320
and a photo of you and your birthdate
was the only lead I had.

286
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:33,710
A photo?

287
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:36,000
Are you saying you have a photo of me?

288
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:38,710
Why?

289
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,260
Why do you have a photo of me?

290
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:45,180
Seriously, what are you?
You said this the moment you saw me.

291
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:47,140
"I've finally met you."

292
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:49,430
Why did you finally meet me?

293
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:52,390
You had better worry about your life.

294
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,400
Anyone who talks down to me like you,
gets beheaded.

295
00:16:58,070 --> 00:16:59,320
Are you a spy?

296
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,780
Is your mission
to explode this police station?

297
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:06,320
-Is that why you secretly investigated me?
-You don't look that important...

298
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:08,660
-Do you know me?
-I was curious about you,

299
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,540
and I thought about you a lot.

300
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:12,660
You also look better in real life.

301
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:21,760
That young man is the Captain
of the Royal Guards in my world.

302
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:24,550
Some people don't exist
in both worlds like you and me.

303
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:28,220
So, this is a parallel world?

304
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:29,930
Prove it.

305
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:31,600
The proof is right in front of you.

306
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,180
I came

307
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:36,390
from the other world.

308
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:49,620
Why

309
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:52,450
do you look at me like that?

310
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:54,370
How else should I look at you?

311
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:56,000
You must make sure
they don't give me the wrong idea.

312
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,000
Right now,
your eyes are those of a criminal.

313
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:00,170
A petty criminal.

314
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,960
-You don't have other proofs, do you?
-Lieutenant Jeong Tae-eul.

315
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:07,970
To help you understand,
I will give you a simple explanation.

316
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:09,090
So, listen carefully.

317
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:14,140
Quantum mechanics
that Albert Einstein discovered...

318
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,480
You know,

319
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:21,360
I don't know about other things,
but I know my eyes are charming.

320
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,770
I was born with deep-set eyes.

321
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:26,570
What about the quantum mechanics
that Albert Einstein discovered?

322
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:28,320
Did the mechanics fix a car or something?

323
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:39,210
Quantum mechanics
that Albert Einstein discovered

324
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:41,330
led to the parallel universe theory.

325
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,210
The theory where our universe
consists of particles

326
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:48,010
and can exist in two places

327
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:50,140
if particles that form substances

328
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,470
can be waves as well

329
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:56,060
just like light can be both waves

330
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:58,440
and particles at the same time

331
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:02,310
and therefore suggest the possibility
of the existence of parallel universes.

332
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:09,570
I guess that didn't help.

333
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:14,030
The theory where our universe--

334
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:20,750
Thanks for the speech.

335
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:25,550
They are all Idiots.

336
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:28,760
I thought I would see only gorgeous men
once I become the prime minister.

337
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:30,260
But you...

338
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:37,810
But you formed the cabinet.

339
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,850
I know.

340
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:43,770
I chose them to shoot in the foot.

341
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,610
-So, that was it for today, right?
-Yes, ma'am.

342
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:49,190
I will see you tomorrow.

343
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:02,540
Is the article on
the state administration published?

344
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:03,710
Yes.

345
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,670
Here.

346
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:10,720
And starting from tomorrow,

347
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,510
the schedule of His Majesty
is open for a week.

348
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:13,590
So, I had a look into it

349
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:16,300
and the security level for Prince Buyeong
has elevated, as expected.

350
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,970
So, the King ran off again.

351
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:26,770
Maybe he has a woman.

352
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,860
That woman is here.

353
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:31,400
If the King has a woman,
that woman has to be me.

354
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:34,070
I'm trying to make
the whole nation believe that,

355
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,120
so it would be bad
if he has another woman.

356
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,450
Is she young? Is she pretty?

357
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,830
The chance must be pretty high.

358
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:43,830
Get out.

359
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:45,080
Yes, ma'am.

360
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:03,270
THESE ARE THE FACES
OF THE KINGDOM OF COREA

361
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:04,600
THEY LOOK CUTE TOGETHER

362
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,860
IS THE KING AND THE PRIME MINISTER
ON A DATE?

363
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:11,190
He was right.

364
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,160
The left side of my face looks prettier.

365
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,160
The lipstick was a bit too much.

366
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:27,920
I'm letting you go because I'm a good cop.

367
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Consider yourself lucky.

368
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:31,000
I was bound to be freed
after 48 hours anyway

369
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:32,510
because there's no reason to arrest me.

370
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:34,380
Yes, but you got out earlier.

371
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:38,220
How can I contact you
when I get the DNA test result?

372
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,220
Right.

373
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:40,850
Well...

374
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:49,980
You can contact me here.

375
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:51,980
I heard this was near your place.

376
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:53,490
Who says that?

377
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:54,650
That young man from earlier.

378
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:55,570
ROYAL INFINITY HOTEL

379
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:57,610
Was his name Eun-sup?

380
00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:00,450
I heard he was your junior in high school.

381
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:04,040
And I also heard that your father runs
a taekwondo center.

382
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:08,500
Do you even know
how expensive this hotel is?

383
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:10,250
This is a five-star hotel.

384
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:12,710
-Do you have money?
-I don't, but I can get some.

385
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:16,130
Where's the nearest jewelry shop
around here?

386
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,760
This is a diamond.

387
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:24,770
It's a diamond?

388
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:28,730
If that's a diamond, I'm Princess Diana.

389
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,650
I have been a gemologist for 40 years

390
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:37,900
and I haven't seen a diamond
with such delicate cuts.

391
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:43,030
I would say
it practically has no inclusions at all.

392
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:44,950
Goodness.

393
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:48,500
Where did you get this?

394
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:50,670
I will ask where they bought it later.

395
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:52,840
The Head Court Lady is in charge.

396
00:22:54,050 --> 00:22:55,710
How much can you give me?

397
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,840
Well...

398
00:22:57,220 --> 00:23:00,340
It's a fine product,
but there's no warranty.

399
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:04,310
And a fine diamond like this
includes risks.

400
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:08,600
JEONG TAE-EUL
NATIONAL POLICE AGENCY

401
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:10,980
Are you a cop?

402
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:11,980
Yes.

403
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,320
Why don't you tell him
about your other identity?

404
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,570
Princess Diana.

405
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,380
You seem confused.

406
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:36,750
So, what's with the diamond?

407
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:39,090
Did you steal it?

408
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,640
Have you seen anyone who accompanies a cop

409
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,550
when trying to sell a stolen diamond?

410
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:52,100
Who knows?
Maybe that Head Court Lady or whatever

411
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:53,480
stole it.

412
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,820
I will ask her that too.

413
00:23:57,530 --> 00:23:59,190
She's not the kind of person though.

414
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:04,990
What is that, by the way?

415
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:06,370
Princess Diana.

416
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:12,080
It's the 63 building.

417
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:13,920
Why?

418
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:16,340
Does your world
not have something like that?

419
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:20,550
We have 63 of that in Haeundae.

420
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:23,050
-Is that the only one here?
-Yes, it's the only one.

421
00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:26,140
You can take a taxi across the road
to get to the hotel.

422
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:31,230
Are you leaving?

423
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,310
Why?

424
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,560
Don't go.

425
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:40,650
It took 25 years for me to meet you.

426
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:44,280
I wish

427
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:47,370
today will be a long day.

428
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,740
Get out of my way, will you?

429
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:52,660
I already had a long day today
because of Kim Gae-ddong.

430
00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:00,920
LEE SANG-DO'S WIFE, TESTIFIER

431
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:03,680
Hello?

432
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:06,800
Is this Mr. Lee Sang-do's wife?

433
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,470
Yes, I can. I will be right there.

434
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:17,690
Hey, Lee Sang-do's wife
answered the phone.

435
00:25:17,770 --> 00:25:19,270
Okay. See you at the hardware store.

436
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:27,780
I think it's been about three weeks
since my husband left home.

437
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,000
Why did you not report him missing then?

438
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:36,370
It's not like this is the first time
he ran away from home after we fought.

439
00:25:37,290 --> 00:25:39,090
I just thought he might
be gambling somewhere.

440
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:42,300
This time, it lasted a bit longer though.

441
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:47,760
Is there anyone
who might hold a grudge against him?

442
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:49,550
To be honest,

443
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:53,470
whoever killed him, it would make sense.

444
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:57,770
He borrowed money from everyone he knew.

445
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:02,440
He borrowed money from everyone,
carrying two phones around.

446
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:05,150
Now I have to pay for all the debt...

447
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,560
My, she grew by leaps and bounds.

448
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:45,400
-Hello?
-This is a collect call.

449
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:46,360
Eun-sup,

450
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,700
it's me, King Arthur.

451
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:51,530
Please pick up the phone.
I need to talk to you.

452
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:54,740
If you wish to continue the phone call,
press the pound key.

453
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,500
He's out of his mind.

454
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:02,340
Come in.

455
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:04,340
Wow.

456
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:08,300
I'm glad I managed to convince you
after 13 attempts.

457
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:10,220
This suite is awesome.

458
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:13,430
By the way,

459
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:16,720
why did you bring me here?

460
00:27:16,810 --> 00:27:18,640
I wanted to catch up with you.

461
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:20,310
"Catch up"?

462
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,730
I've got nothing to catch up on with you.

463
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:26,650
Everything in your left hand is all yours.

464
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:28,360
Do you want me to sit over there?

465
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:31,320
So, what should we begin with?

466
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:33,530
I want to see a photo of your family.

467
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:36,290
It would be better if it was from
when you were very young.

468
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:40,790
Most people usually don't carry around
photos like that,

469
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:43,790
but I looked the best then.

470
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,090
Hold on.

471
00:27:45,170 --> 00:27:46,210
All right.

472
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:50,090
Where is the photo of my life?

473
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:53,220
There it is.

474
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:56,060
Why do you want to see the photo though?

475
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:01,440
I was right.

476
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:05,610
This is a parallel world.

477
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:09,490
Hey, do you want to die?

478
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:12,950
Answer your phone before I kill you.

479
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:15,030
You freak. A horse?

480
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,120
Are you serious? You told him, didn't you?

481
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:19,660
Pick up the phone already,
or I will kill you.

482
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:22,330
Answer me! You are so dead.

483
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:27,250
Someone is texting you.

484
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:29,420
A warning of murder.

485
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:40,390
I heard you had a broad yard.

486
00:28:40,810 --> 00:28:43,810
Please take good care of Maximus,
my seventh-grade official.

487
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:46,190
What in the world is this?

488
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:47,860
It doesn't make any sense.

489
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:48,900
It looks so well-fed.

490
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:52,650
It doesn't seem to be a regular horse.

491
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,990
-It's a seventh-grade official.
-I knew it.

492
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:59,160
Tae-eul, are you sure the man
who left this horse is the owner?

493
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:01,950
If he is, let's not let him go.
You must not let him go.

494
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,540
Not many people in Korea own horses.
He must be incredibly rich.

495
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:06,130
-Is that so?
-Yes.

496
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:08,960
See that? Old sayings are always right.

497
00:29:09,050 --> 00:29:11,210
"Nice horses for nice horses."

498
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:14,340
"Soft horse turns away wrath."

499
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:15,590
That's right.

500
00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:18,010
It sounds somewhat off though.

501
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:19,680
-Delivery!
-What do you mean?

502
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,270
Hey, take a picture of it.

503
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:25,190
Did you order fried chicken?

504
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:26,190
-Yes.
-Delivery.

505
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,690
Thank you.

506
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:29,980
I ordered some food.
You should have some too.

507
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:32,940
-Come here.
-I have got no appetite.

508
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,110
Dang, I really am in trouble.

509
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:39,160
Kim Gae-ddong!

510
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:42,750
A moment of your time, please.

511
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:46,000
Has a well-built man
in his early thirties,

512
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,250
around 187cm in height with a likable face

513
00:29:48,330 --> 00:29:50,090
checked in at this hotel today?

514
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:53,170
I'm sorry, but we are not permitted
to give out information on--

515
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:54,340
Yes, I know.

516
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,930
You don't need to tell me.

517
00:29:57,010 --> 00:29:58,220
Hold on a second, please.

518
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:07,730
The horse you left at my place.

519
00:30:07,810 --> 00:30:09,940
I bet I can sell it for a good price.

520
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:12,480
I'm giving you ten minutes.

521
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:22,620
Please deliver this message to his room.

522
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:39,550
That was nine minutes and forty seconds.
Close call.

523
00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:41,890
The suite is on the upper floors,

524
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:43,970
so it took five minutes
for the manager to come up.

525
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:46,230
-I headed down as soon as I could.
-Sit.

526
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:47,640
I was about to.

527
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:51,480
Should I sit here like this?

528
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,190
What are you going to do about the horse?

529
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:56,940
If it's okay with you--

530
00:30:57,030 --> 00:30:58,450
It's not okay with me.

531
00:30:58,530 --> 00:31:00,490
I will feed him and brush him myself.

532
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:01,700
Stop stating the obvious.

533
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:02,990
Only for a while.

534
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:04,990
I can't stay here for long.

535
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,910
I must return to my own world.

536
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:11,540
Could you lend my dear Maximus
just 16 square meters of your lawn?

537
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:15,000
Isn't that my entire lawn?
When are you going back to your world?

538
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:16,630
I haven't decided yet.

539
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:18,630
You should have done that first.

540
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,050
I should have,

541
00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:22,800
but I postponed it for later.

542
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:24,390
I like

543
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:27,520
being here with you like this.

544
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,110
And you went shopping in the meanwhile?

545
00:31:38,150 --> 00:31:41,740
I was out shopping for Eun-sup,
and the clerk asked me to try it on.

546
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:44,660
I tried it as I needed a change of clothes

547
00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:48,660
and it looked so good on me.

548
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:50,920
I wasn't asking a question.
It was an insult.

549
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:52,290
Never mind.

550
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,840
I will look after the horse
until the DNA test result comes in.

551
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,380
Why are you tying your hair?

552
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:58,880
Don't tie your hair.

553
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:03,720
Focus, will you?

554
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:06,760
I'm going to look after your horse.

555
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:08,720
Animals are innocent,

556
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:12,100
but Kim Gae-ddong might not be.

557
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,610
So, stay out of trouble until then.

558
00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:18,480
Unless you want to find out
how much your horse can sell for.

559
00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:29,500
That was scary.

560
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:35,460
The cause of death is
a blunt force trauma to the head.

561
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:37,130
The stage of rigor mortis shows

562
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:39,210
that the body was disposed
in the trunk after death.

563
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:42,970
Taking it into account
that the decaying process was quick

564
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:45,140
since the body was in the trunk,
the death was three weeks ago.

565
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:47,600
The victim Lee Sang-do left home
three weeks ago.

566
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:50,180
Did you figure out
what weapon it was exactly?

567
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:53,140
Yes. One is the wound on the corpse

568
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:54,850
and the other is that of the suspect,
Kim Bok-man.

569
00:32:55,730 --> 00:32:58,690
The two wounds are identical.
There's one weapon.

570
00:32:58,770 --> 00:33:00,400
It must be a tool that is quite heavy.

571
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:03,610
Could it be something like this?

572
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:08,030
A lever?

573
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,700
I don't see why not.

574
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,910
It's often used
at the National Assembly too.

575
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,500
Could this be

576
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:20,800
what made these wounds?

577
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,840
I guess it could be.

578
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:26,300
-Let's find the weapon first.
-Okay.

579
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:31,060
BOTTLES, METAL, STYROFOAM

580
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,280
Hello?

581
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,900
It seems that there's a food called
budaejjigae in your world.

582
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:46,320
I would like to try it.
If you are free sometime--

583
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:52,370
Hello?

584
00:33:52,450 --> 00:33:54,040
I'm in front of the Gyeongbokgung Palace.

585
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:56,420
And they happen to be reenacting
a royal event.

586
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,130
Why do they say it's for the last king?

587
00:33:58,210 --> 00:33:59,750
Did something happen to Queen Yuna--

588
00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:03,420
Hello?

589
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:05,510
I just discovered
something very interesting.

590
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:08,140
It turns out that the bakery
that provides my pre-meal bread

591
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:09,930
exists in this world too.

592
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:12,850
What's odd is though,

593
00:34:13,390 --> 00:34:15,020
that everyone here is tasting--

594
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:24,860
Excuse me.

595
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:25,990
Thank you.

596
00:34:26,490 --> 00:34:28,240
I wouldn't mind if you used it for longer.

597
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:30,410
That would be dangerous.

598
00:34:30,490 --> 00:34:33,450
I suppose she's tying up her hair now.

599
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:34,830
I see.

600
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,620
I would like to have this one packed.

601
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,670
This is a sample.

602
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:43,210
Here.

603
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:44,170
No.

604
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:45,800
I want this.

605
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:47,760
Excuse me?

606
00:35:07,570 --> 00:35:12,280
I'm sure you have a good car, a secretary,

607
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:15,040
and other better things to do.

608
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:18,580
Why are you doing tough work like this?

609
00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:22,040
This dancheong has 300 years of history.

610
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:25,250
Painting over it like this

611
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:28,090
is as if I am covering it
with another history.

612
00:35:33,010 --> 00:35:34,930
A history of my own.

613
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:36,140
I see.

614
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:37,640
That's why

615
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:42,520
your color seems to have depth.

616
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:04,380
Good.

617
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,790
Thank you so much
for coming to Myeong-ho's birthday party.

618
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:14,250
Don't say that. We should thank you.

619
00:36:15,170 --> 00:36:16,050
It's fun.

620
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:22,300
Okay. So, enjoy the food and have fun.

621
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,510
Right. I got him a present.

622
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:31,060
-Happy birthday.
-Happy birthday.

623
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:32,140
Thank you.

624
00:36:33,770 --> 00:36:35,270
Hurry. Take a picture.

625
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:39,320
Look at his face.

626
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,780
He looks ugly in this one.

627
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:49,830
This one?

628
00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:54,460
It would be nice if you play soccer
with Myeong-ho one day.

629
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:58,210
Now, shall we blow out the candles?

630
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:59,550
We were just about to leave now.

631
00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:01,760
We're going to play on a trampoline,

632
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,180
but Myeong-ho can't do that.

633
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:04,090
Let's go.

634
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,860
-I want to go to the toilet.
-Sure.

635
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:19,730
No, I can go by myself.

636
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:05,360
I'm sorry.

637
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:07,110
We were too loud, weren't we?

638
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:10,160
What did you pray for?

639
00:38:11,370 --> 00:38:12,450
Well...

640
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,710
I wish my son can...

641
00:38:23,090 --> 00:38:26,510
I wish my son can walk.

642
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:29,220
That will not happen.

643
00:38:30,970 --> 00:38:35,230
Your child will never get to walk.

644
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:37,440
However,

645
00:38:38,810 --> 00:38:41,900
you can make those children limp.

646
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:47,740
Would you like to change the prayer?

647
00:38:55,950 --> 00:38:58,580
Three elementary students
have been seriously injured

648
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:00,750
by a truck while jaywalking.

649
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:04,210
It is unlikely that the three students
will make a full recovery.

650
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:08,550
We must review the speed limit
in school zones.

651
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:10,930
Is there a happy occasion to celebrate?

652
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:13,390
Yes.

653
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:16,430
It's my dead son's birthday.

654
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:19,440
I'm sorry.

655
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:25,400
Why are you sorry?

656
00:39:26,570 --> 00:39:27,860
Just finish what you were doing.

657
00:39:52,930 --> 00:39:55,850
Ms. Song Jeong-hye, are you inside?
It's the police.

658
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:02,060
I'm here because of your son, Ms. Song.

659
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:05,440
Your son

660
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,280
tripped at a reservoir and drowned.

661
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:12,530
Your husband was killed
by a hit-and-runner.

662
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:14,990
Both your husband and son

663
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:17,830
had suspicious deaths.

664
00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:20,370
Now, the whole world

665
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:23,250
will accuse you.

666
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:29,460
What do you want to do now?

667
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:34,550
Do you want redemption?

668
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:56,780
How pathetic you are.

669
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,580
You've sinned by laughing once,

670
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:05,420
and now you can never laugh again.

671
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:19,180
LEE JI-HUN
OCTOBER 28, 1987 - DECEMBER 28, 1994

672
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:29,940
This is the record of the blackmailing
text messages the victim sent you.

673
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:33,530
He sent dozens of messages a day,
saying things like you should watch out

674
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:35,530
and he would kill you.

675
00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:38,870
He even found the address
to your apartment and blackmailed you.

676
00:41:43,330 --> 00:41:48,500
Detective, you shouldn't let
such trivial texts fluster yourself.

677
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:50,710
I didn't kill him.

678
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:53,970
A bloodstain was detected in your place.

679
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:56,260
That's my blood.

680
00:41:56,340 --> 00:42:00,310
I was going home after drinking
and someone hit the back of my head.

681
00:42:00,390 --> 00:42:02,390
Is that so? When was that?

682
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:07,940
Tell me the exact date, time,
and your whereabouts on that day.

683
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:11,980
I think it was three weeks ago.

684
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:13,740
Wait. Maybe it wasn't that long ago.

685
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:15,400
Damn it. I don't know.

686
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:18,070
When I regained consciousness,
I found myself at home.

687
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,950
And the floor was all bloody,
so I wiped it.

688
00:42:22,950 --> 00:42:24,330
It's not your blood.

689
00:42:24,410 --> 00:42:26,460
It corresponds to the victim's DNA.

690
00:42:27,250 --> 00:42:31,250
Lee Sang-do attacked you
with a weapon first and you murdered him

691
00:42:32,090 --> 00:42:33,210
with the weapon.

692
00:42:34,170 --> 00:42:35,550
Where is the weapon?

693
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:39,800
What weapon? I didn't do it.

694
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:43,140
Go ask at the bar.
I'm a regular customer there.

695
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:49,650
NUMBER ONE

696
00:42:55,530 --> 00:42:56,400
Wait.

697
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:00,820
It's Lee Sang-do.

698
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:07,080
I checked the CCTV

699
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:10,880
and it's certain that Lee Sang-do
followed Kim Bok-man three weeks ago.

700
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:14,000
Lee Sang-do followed him
to the entrance of his apartment building

701
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:16,340
and his whereabouts after that
is unconfirmed.

702
00:43:18,130 --> 00:43:20,220
There's nothing useful
from the CCTV of the apartment.

703
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:21,220
The footage is kept only for a week.

704
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:24,720
It seems pretty simple now.

705
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:26,600
All we need to do is to find the weapon.

706
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:27,730
The weapon?

707
00:43:28,310 --> 00:43:29,690
It's ten. Let's go home.

708
00:43:30,810 --> 00:43:32,270
-Let's go home.
-Wait.

709
00:43:35,570 --> 00:43:38,650
How did an owner of the hardware store
who is just an ordinary man

710
00:43:39,610 --> 00:43:42,490
find Kim Bok-man's phone number
and home address?

711
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:47,290
There's no information whatsoever
on Kim Bok-man's website.

712
00:43:48,210 --> 00:43:49,790
Why would he hire a private detective

713
00:43:50,290 --> 00:43:52,130
when he had so much debt?

714
00:43:52,210 --> 00:43:54,210
I guess he didn't mind
having a little more debt.

715
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:55,630
You see,

716
00:43:56,090 --> 00:44:00,050
when one loses money and loses their mind,
they can do anything.

717
00:44:00,130 --> 00:44:03,010
We might need to hire a private detective
ourselves to find the weapon.

718
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:05,680
Tomorrow, we need to scavenge--

719
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,600
That's a good point. Let's go home.

720
00:44:11,270 --> 00:44:12,310
Let's go home.

721
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:13,560
Let's go.

722
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,120
Open your mouth.

723
00:44:31,790 --> 00:44:35,000
You seem like a high-class horse,
so I got an organic one.

724
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:38,210
What's the matter?

725
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:40,340
Is it not good enough
for a seventh-grade official?

726
00:44:40,590 --> 00:44:42,220
Does it have to be fresh from the farm?

727
00:44:43,590 --> 00:44:44,760
My goodness.

728
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:51,480
Why do I feel like you just got mad at me?

729
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:56,400
Where's your owner?

730
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:06,990
Hey, Eun-sup.

731
00:45:07,370 --> 00:45:08,660
Where are you now?

732
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:20,710
THE KOREAN WAR, A NATIONAL TRAGEDY

733
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:25,010
He's been doing that for three days now.

734
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:28,180
I gave him a cushion to sit on
and fed him after work.

735
00:45:29,510 --> 00:45:31,310
I will feed him today.

736
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:40,610
Why is she sitting there?

737
00:45:42,610 --> 00:45:43,610
Is she his girlfriend?

738
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:44,860
He had a girlfriend?

739
00:45:53,370 --> 00:45:55,870
Are you from the Louvre Museum?
You're like a sculpture.

740
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:58,340
A nation that forgets its past
has no future.

741
00:45:58,420 --> 00:45:59,710
Drink this and keep it up.

742
00:45:59,790 --> 00:46:01,500
Most people here seem very kind.

743
00:46:02,210 --> 00:46:03,720
They kept giving me things like this.

744
00:46:05,090 --> 00:46:06,930
And I discovered something important.

745
00:46:07,010 --> 00:46:09,720
In this world,
this country has a presidential system.

746
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:11,060
Well done.

747
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:14,850
She's leaving.

748
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:15,980
Is he going with her?

749
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:18,770
Please don't go.

750
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:20,730
-Oh, no. Don't go.
-Please don't.

751
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:41,540
Why aren't you eating?

752
00:46:41,630 --> 00:46:43,800
I don't eat food
that wasn't tasted beforehand.

753
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:46,010
I could be poisoned anytime.

754
00:46:46,090 --> 00:46:48,260
Is that so?
Then how have you been eating food here?

755
00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:49,590
Eun-sup did it for me.

756
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:51,260
You made him taste your food?

757
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:53,890
I didn't even have to.
He always eats first.

758
00:46:53,970 --> 00:46:54,930
So,

759
00:46:55,730 --> 00:46:57,350
are you saying I should taste your food?

760
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:58,310
No.

761
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:02,110
If this food is poisoned
and I'm dying here,

762
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:06,280
what I'm saying now will be my last words.

763
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:12,370
Shoot.

764
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:14,790
Thank you for everything.

765
00:47:16,540 --> 00:47:18,210
Because you existed somewhere,

766
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:20,290
I was less lonely

767
00:47:21,580 --> 00:47:22,790
for the past 25 years.

768
00:47:45,030 --> 00:47:46,440
How can food

769
00:47:47,650 --> 00:47:48,860
taste like this?

770
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:51,030
I haven't tasted anything like this.

771
00:47:51,110 --> 00:47:53,580
Do you not have any chicken in your world?

772
00:47:53,660 --> 00:47:55,990
We don't have ones
covered in sauce like this.

773
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:03,250
It tastes excellent.

774
00:48:05,050 --> 00:48:06,460
What did you do in the library?

775
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:08,880
I read about your world's history.

776
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:11,220
I wanted to know how different it is
from that in my world.

777
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:12,840
So, how is it different?

778
00:48:12,930 --> 00:48:15,640
The history of this country separated
since Prince Sohyeon.

779
00:48:16,510 --> 00:48:18,850
In your world, he passed away early

780
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:21,520
while in my world,
he remained in history as King Yeongjong.

781
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:23,230
He stopped the Qing invasion.

782
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:26,440
The history of the two worlds
started to go separate ways since

783
00:48:26,610 --> 00:48:28,190
and ended up here now.

784
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:30,530
It seemed that in your world,
the country has quickly grown

785
00:48:30,610 --> 00:48:33,160
through intensive industrialization
since the war and division.

786
00:48:34,030 --> 00:48:35,080
I was impressed.

787
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:36,950
Do you write novels online?

788
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:39,160
Is that what you wrote until now?

789
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:42,000
Do you think it's here?

790
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:46,040
The reason why I survived that day.

791
00:48:47,050 --> 00:48:51,510
Even on a night like that, a baby is born.

792
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:53,050
Isn't it great?

793
00:48:55,550 --> 00:48:57,310
That night,

794
00:48:58,970 --> 00:49:00,310
I heard the sound of a flute.

795
00:49:22,210 --> 00:49:24,420
Do you think
it was the sound of Manpasikjeok?

796
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:26,290
No way.

797
00:49:27,170 --> 00:49:30,090
Manpasikjeok doesn't make any sound,
Your Majesty.

798
00:49:30,170 --> 00:49:31,420
That's not true.

799
00:49:32,340 --> 00:49:34,130
I definitely heard it.

800
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:36,640
That's why I went to Cheonjongo.

801
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:39,680
I couldn't hear anything

802
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:42,350
because the flute was too loud.

803
00:49:44,190 --> 00:49:45,770
I couldn't even hear the gunfire.

804
00:49:52,070 --> 00:49:55,160
I didn't know you remembered everything

805
00:49:56,490 --> 00:50:00,620
because you have never mentioned
what happened that day.

806
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:04,160
I held onto two things

807
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:06,620
that night.

808
00:50:07,420 --> 00:50:09,380
I'm asking if one of them

809
00:50:10,710 --> 00:50:14,050
is in the whip you are holding.

810
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:22,560
Also, whether or not
you have the other one.

811
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:26,480
That's right.

812
00:50:29,310 --> 00:50:32,530
I have been keeping it in secret

813
00:50:33,650 --> 00:50:37,530
and I brought it to give it back to you
despite my fear.

814
00:50:40,450 --> 00:50:42,620
What an odd thing it is.

815
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:46,080
Something that is silent made a sound

816
00:50:47,330 --> 00:50:50,500
and something
that cannot be identified exists.

817
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:56,880
Which is why I wished

818
00:50:57,800 --> 00:51:00,430
you had forgotten everything.

819
00:51:11,230 --> 00:51:14,690
Is this a secret between us?

820
00:51:16,190 --> 00:51:18,070
Yes, Your Majesty.

821
00:51:20,950 --> 00:51:22,120
JEONG TAE-EUL
NATIONAL POLICE AGENCY

822
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:23,490
Do you think it's here?

823
00:51:24,450 --> 00:51:25,450
The reason

824
00:51:26,870 --> 00:51:28,620
why I survived that day.

825
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:34,170
Why do you never believe

826
00:51:35,340 --> 00:51:36,630
anything I say?

827
00:51:36,710 --> 00:51:38,130
Is that how belief works?

828
00:51:39,590 --> 00:51:41,890
Am I supposed to believe
nonsense just like that?

829
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:45,640
I'm the type of person who still can't
believe the earth is round.

830
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:47,930
But a parallel universe?

831
00:51:48,770 --> 00:51:49,940
Pre-meal bakery?

832
00:51:50,650 --> 00:51:52,440
Stop your nonsense
and eat before it gets cold.

833
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:55,900
Just do one thing
before we get your DNA test result.

834
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:57,570
Do nothing.

835
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:00,610
If you don't believe me,
why do you help me?

836
00:52:01,990 --> 00:52:03,200
Is it some kind of a sense of duty?

837
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:05,160
You need that
only when you have to save the country.

838
00:52:05,990 --> 00:52:07,120
Then why?

839
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:09,710
There's no reason. I just do it.

840
00:52:09,790 --> 00:52:11,580
I'm a police officer
of the Republic of Korea.

841
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:19,090
Anything else?

842
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:22,680
Is there any other reason?

843
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:26,140
The reason why
I have to stay in your world.

844
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:28,640
Could there be a reason?

845
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:04,010
EXHIBITION FROM KING TAEJO
TO THE LAST KING SUNJONG

846
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:00,820
I just saw the White Rabbit
with the clock.

847
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:27,010
Goodness. What was that?

848
00:54:28,220 --> 00:54:30,010
Wait. You are Jo Yeong.

849
00:54:31,140 --> 00:54:32,560
Where did you buy this?

850
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:34,350
It's our class uniform.

851
00:54:34,430 --> 00:54:36,770
I suppose we ordered them online.

852
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:38,810
Please excuse me.

853
00:54:39,310 --> 00:54:41,110
Can I take a picture with you?

854
00:54:41,190 --> 00:54:42,400
No.

855
00:54:49,990 --> 00:54:54,370
They said they would call me by today,
but I still didn't hear back.

856
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:56,210
I guess it means I didn't pass.

857
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:58,210
Where are you? Let's go grab a drink.

858
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:00,790
Hang on a second.

859
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:03,800
Hey, I will call you back.

860
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:05,760
THE ROYAL PUBLIC AFFAIRS OFFICE

861
00:55:07,930 --> 00:55:09,090
Hello?

862
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:10,510
Yes.

863
00:55:11,180 --> 00:55:12,310
That's me.

864
00:55:13,510 --> 00:55:15,770
The final interview? Really?

865
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:17,440
Okay.

866
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:19,600
Okay.

867
00:55:20,730 --> 00:55:23,190
Okay. Thank you. Bye.

868
00:55:23,780 --> 00:55:27,070
Are you Ms. Myeong Seung-a?
I work for the Royal Guard--

869
00:55:27,150 --> 00:55:29,910
Jo Yeong. You're really him.
This is unbelievable.

870
00:55:29,990 --> 00:55:31,620
That's right. I'm Jo Yeong.

871
00:55:33,370 --> 00:55:36,700
Is this the camera that you were holding
at the rowing competition?

872
00:55:37,580 --> 00:55:38,750
May I see the photos?

873
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:40,790
What?

874
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:43,340
Sure. Take a look. Here.

875
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:48,590
Did you know I was here?

876
00:55:49,180 --> 00:55:50,550
Yes, I knew you were here.

877
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:52,510
Oh, you did.

878
00:55:54,140 --> 00:55:55,060
How?

879
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:06,690
Thanks for your cooperation.

880
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:10,150
Could you please send me
the photos by e-mail?

881
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:11,160
Wow.

882
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:13,570
I guess these photos are helpful.

883
00:56:13,660 --> 00:56:17,330
I don't know yet,
but I might find a clue later.

884
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:19,120
Here's my e-mail address.

885
00:56:19,210 --> 00:56:20,620
He's so cool.

886
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:21,790
I can hear you.

887
00:56:21,870 --> 00:56:23,000
Really?

888
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:41,730
Did you investigate the assailants
from the rowing competition?

889
00:56:41,890 --> 00:56:45,730
Yes, but they seem irrelevant
to His Majesty's absence.

890
00:56:46,570 --> 00:56:48,480
I found one lead though.

891
00:56:48,610 --> 00:56:50,610
It's the woman that caused the incident.

892
00:56:50,860 --> 00:56:53,200
It seems that His Majesty
was after that woman as well.

893
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:54,200
Wait.

894
00:56:55,070 --> 00:56:57,290
His Majesty was after whom?

895
00:56:57,950 --> 00:56:58,830
A woman?

896
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,910
I just saw the White Rabbit
with the clock.

897
00:57:02,580 --> 00:57:04,250
It's just my suspicion.

898
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:06,590
I will let you know
when I find concrete evidence.

899
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:09,880
Make sure to make
a thorough investigation.

900
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:11,420
Yes, ma'am.

901
00:57:11,510 --> 00:57:14,680
The talismans haven't been working,

902
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:19,140
so I was just about to go
and grab the shaman by the hair.

903
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:22,940
I might end up bowing to her
to show my appreciation.

904
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:01,350
One, two, three.

905
00:58:39,010 --> 00:58:41,220
I think that car owner will understand me.

906
00:58:44,430 --> 00:58:45,480
Welcome.

907
00:58:47,730 --> 00:58:49,110
Weren't you just in the yard?

908
00:58:49,730 --> 00:58:52,530
Wait. Are you the owner of the horse?

909
00:58:54,610 --> 00:58:56,900
It's nice to finally meet a citizen
who recognizes me.

910
00:58:57,570 --> 00:58:58,950
As you probably have assumed,

911
00:58:59,030 --> 00:59:00,910
I am the owner
of the seventh-grade official, Maximus,

912
00:59:00,990 --> 00:59:02,910
who is staying in the yard for a while.

913
00:59:02,990 --> 00:59:06,000
I am also
the King of the Kingdom of Corea.

914
00:59:06,580 --> 00:59:09,170
What an interesting character you have.

915
00:59:09,250 --> 00:59:13,250
If you don't mind, I would like to have
a cup of tasted milk tea.

916
00:59:15,670 --> 00:59:17,260
It's 5,800 won and you need to pay first.

917
00:59:46,540 --> 00:59:48,540
Hey, I'm in the yard. Come on down.

918
00:59:51,830 --> 00:59:52,750
Give me five minutes.

919
00:59:54,630 --> 00:59:56,300
Were you home?

920
00:59:57,010 --> 00:59:59,880
He appeared at the Gwanghwamun Junction,
on horseback.

921
01:00:00,380 --> 01:00:03,390
He seemed a bit crazy
but he's good-looking.

922
01:00:03,470 --> 01:00:06,430
I found no one
that matches his fingerprints.

923
01:00:06,930 --> 01:00:08,020
But he was handsome.

924
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:11,400
I heard Tae-eul got herself into
a difficult situation with a handsome guy.

925
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:12,690
Have you seen him?

926
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:16,070
Hey, Eun-sup is waiting. You can go first.

927
01:00:16,150 --> 01:00:17,690
I'll join you after hanging the laundry.

928
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:19,990
What should we order? Half and half?

929
01:00:20,070 --> 01:00:21,660
-Hey, wait--
-Sounds great!

930
01:00:35,170 --> 01:00:36,750
I know I have just met you,

931
01:00:37,210 --> 01:00:40,880
but what exactly is the relationship
between you and Lieutenant Jeong?

932
01:00:40,970 --> 01:00:42,430
Container ship?

933
01:00:43,510 --> 01:00:45,300
Tanker ship?

934
01:00:45,470 --> 01:00:46,850
Passenger ship?

935
01:00:48,020 --> 01:00:49,270
What do you mean?

936
01:00:49,350 --> 01:00:51,640
If you know we just met,
then why do you say such bullshit?

937
01:00:52,230 --> 01:00:53,100
That's what I meant.

938
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:55,770
Stand there.

939
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:01,900
It's a mug shot. Just in case.

940
01:01:02,030 --> 01:01:03,200
I heard you're unidentified.

941
01:01:03,860 --> 01:01:04,700
Stand there.

942
01:01:07,790 --> 01:01:08,990
Are you crazy? What was that?

943
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:10,750
Just in case you are my savior.

944
01:01:11,290 --> 01:01:13,710
I wished you weren't, and you aren't.

945
01:01:13,790 --> 01:01:15,040
Who is this crazy bastard?

946
01:01:15,130 --> 01:01:16,460
I've heard that many times
since my arrival.

947
01:01:16,540 --> 01:01:17,750
Although

948
01:01:18,550 --> 01:01:20,550
it doesn't mean you can say it though.

949
01:01:20,630 --> 01:01:23,800
Every word you say is beyond common sense.

950
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:25,340
You had better watch what you say.

951
01:01:25,850 --> 01:01:27,050
Beheading is my kindest offer.

952
01:01:34,310 --> 01:01:36,360
What do you think
my kindest offer is then?

953
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:40,480
I'm the kindest when I just met someone.

954
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:48,660
Which means if I see you once again,
there will be more than just kind words.

955
01:01:57,670 --> 01:01:58,710
Yes, I'm coming.

956
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:07,510
I still have no clue
what relationship he and Tae-eul has.

957
01:02:27,950 --> 01:02:29,160
Father!

958
01:02:29,870 --> 01:02:32,330
APRIL 2006

959
01:02:35,540 --> 01:02:38,250
Are we living in the Joseon era or what?

960
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:41,210
How could you accept eggs for tuition?

961
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:48,050
Well, Min-gu's family sells eggs

962
01:02:49,850 --> 01:02:51,640
and they have too many left this month.

963
01:02:52,850 --> 01:02:56,480
You know, it takes quite a while
to go to the supermarket to buy eggs.

964
01:02:58,060 --> 01:02:59,690
It's all protein.

965
01:03:00,650 --> 01:03:04,190
You're saying nonsense.

966
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:06,320
How can you pay the rent
for the center with this?

967
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:09,200
I told you that you should help the kids
with their homework.

968
01:03:09,780 --> 01:03:12,280
You can't teach
the five tenets of taekwondo.

969
01:03:12,490 --> 01:03:14,330
to the kids that want pink belts.

970
01:03:14,830 --> 01:03:16,160
By the way,

971
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,670
why haven't you showed me the report card
from the mock exam in April?

972
01:03:19,750 --> 01:03:20,790
Tell me.

973
01:03:21,540 --> 01:03:24,550
It's been four months
since you entered high school

974
01:03:24,630 --> 01:03:26,760
and I haven't seen any report card.

975
01:03:36,890 --> 01:03:37,940
Father,

976
01:03:39,270 --> 01:03:41,150
I have a good idea.

977
01:03:43,020 --> 01:03:44,530
It's a brilliant idea.

978
01:03:44,610 --> 01:03:46,900
The idea just crossed my mind

979
01:03:47,820 --> 01:03:49,280
and I think it will work.

980
01:03:55,660 --> 01:03:58,120
-Want to play pool?
-You are so bad, but if you insist.

981
01:03:58,620 --> 01:04:00,420
Hey, you are the worst.

982
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:01,830
Hey, wait.

983
01:04:09,840 --> 01:04:10,930
Let's go.

984
01:04:14,140 --> 01:04:15,220
TAEKWONDO

985
01:04:48,420 --> 01:04:49,300
It doesn't work.

986
01:04:49,380 --> 01:04:50,220
-Taekwon!
-Taekwon!

987
01:04:50,300 --> 01:04:52,300
I told you I wanted to get
the double eyelid surgery.

988
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:54,600
You will get them when you get older.

989
01:04:55,180 --> 01:04:56,390
Do it properly.

990
01:04:57,470 --> 01:05:00,390
Keep holding up. Then you will get them.

991
01:05:01,190 --> 01:05:03,600
All right. Let's do it again. Taekwon!

992
01:05:03,690 --> 01:05:05,020
-Taekwon!
-Taekwon!

993
01:05:05,110 --> 01:05:07,190
Good. Let's do it again.
Keep your voice up.

994
01:05:07,270 --> 01:05:08,150
Taekwon.

995
01:05:08,230 --> 01:05:09,940
-Taekwon!
-Taekwon!

996
01:05:17,830 --> 01:05:19,790
I told you it was a brilliant idea.

997
01:05:27,590 --> 01:05:28,550
Someone actually came.

998
01:05:29,710 --> 01:05:30,840
All right. At ease.

999
01:05:31,510 --> 01:05:34,640
That's it for today. Let's take a bow.

1000
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:38,760
-Thank you for the lesson.
-Thank you for the lesson.

1001
01:05:48,020 --> 01:05:49,020
What are you doing here?

1002
01:05:49,110 --> 01:05:51,940
I know what "half and half" means too.

1003
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:54,240
I'm coming with you.

1004
01:05:54,320 --> 01:05:55,450
No, you aren't.

1005
01:05:55,950 --> 01:05:58,240
Have quality time
with your seventh-grade official.

1006
01:06:19,010 --> 01:06:20,010
Anything else?

1007
01:06:21,560 --> 01:06:23,480
Is there any other reason?

1008
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:26,730
The reason why
I have to stay in your world.

1009
01:06:28,270 --> 01:06:29,310
Could there be a reason?

1010
01:07:04,100 --> 01:07:07,350
Why are you still here?
Will you keep standing here?

1011
01:07:08,350 --> 01:07:09,190
You

1012
01:07:10,310 --> 01:07:11,730
really shouldn't treat me like this.

1013
01:07:11,820 --> 01:07:12,980
Why not?

1014
01:07:13,980 --> 01:07:15,190
Because it upsets me.

1015
01:07:16,450 --> 01:07:18,610
-What?
-Why would you leave me?

1016
01:07:18,700 --> 01:07:20,660
You are the only person I know
in this world.

1017
01:07:24,620 --> 01:07:25,750
You are driving me crazy.

1018
01:07:27,210 --> 01:07:29,330
Fine. Since you brought it up,
let me ask you.

1019
01:07:29,670 --> 01:07:32,000
Why am I the only person you know
in this world?

1020
01:07:32,170 --> 01:07:35,010
You act like you know me,
but I don't know you.

1021
01:07:35,090 --> 01:07:36,970
How do you know me?

1022
01:07:37,050 --> 01:07:40,550
I acquired your ID card 25 years ago.

1023
01:07:41,350 --> 01:07:43,010
To be precise, someone lost it.

1024
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:45,060
Twenty-five years ago?

1025
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:46,520
Who lost it?

1026
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:49,440
I'm still looking for the person.
The person seems to be related to you.

1027
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:50,850
Of course.

1028
01:07:50,940 --> 01:07:54,150
If that person had my ID card,
they have to be related to me somehow.

1029
01:07:54,230 --> 01:07:56,490
Let's say what you are saying is true.

1030
01:07:56,570 --> 01:07:58,450
But 25 years ago,

1031
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:00,320
I was only five.

1032
01:08:00,490 --> 01:08:04,080
Of course, I was more than qualified
to become a detective when I was five.

1033
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:05,950
But still, you fool,

1034
01:08:06,120 --> 01:08:08,660
how would someone
find my ID card 25 years ago?

1035
01:08:08,750 --> 01:08:11,630
I don't know why,
but your ID card that I have

1036
01:08:11,710 --> 01:08:13,840
was issued on November 11, 2019.

1037
01:08:14,340 --> 01:08:15,960
And I have been waiting for that day.

1038
01:08:19,630 --> 01:08:22,470
November 11?

1039
01:08:26,350 --> 01:08:27,890
That's Leonardo DiCaprio's birthday.

1040
01:08:30,390 --> 01:08:33,230
I totally forgot about him.

1041
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:36,320
Were we just meant to be?

1042
01:08:39,110 --> 01:08:41,360
Hey, Mr. Kim Gae-ddong.

1043
01:08:42,070 --> 01:08:43,660
You're having delusions.

1044
01:08:44,870 --> 01:08:46,370
Seriously,

1045
01:08:47,540 --> 01:08:50,330
stop this and go see a doctor
with the money you got from the diamond.

1046
01:08:50,410 --> 01:08:51,670
I don't have any left.

1047
01:08:51,750 --> 01:08:53,290
Right. It's...

1048
01:08:56,040 --> 01:08:57,750
I'm not just saying this.

1049
01:08:58,090 --> 01:08:59,720
You must have a family

1050
01:09:00,260 --> 01:09:02,840
and they must be worried about you.

1051
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:04,600
Family...

1052
01:09:09,390 --> 01:09:12,560
Is that what you wanted to know?

1053
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:14,270
Yes, it is.

1054
01:09:14,350 --> 01:09:15,310
Okay, then.

1055
01:09:15,690 --> 01:09:16,690
I will give you an answer.

1056
01:09:19,030 --> 01:09:20,360
I'm still single.

1057
01:09:22,780 --> 01:09:24,200
What are you trying to say?

1058
01:09:24,280 --> 01:09:26,280
Which means
I don't have any immediate family.

1059
01:09:26,950 --> 01:09:29,750
Therefore, I have just made
a very important decision.

1060
01:09:30,950 --> 01:09:34,960
I am going to give you the position
where you have to know who I am.

1061
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:36,790
Fine.

1062
01:09:37,340 --> 01:09:38,750
Give it to me. What is it?

1063
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:41,670
I wish I could understand you.

1064
01:09:55,900 --> 01:09:56,900
Lieutenant Jeong Tae-eul.

1065
01:09:59,610 --> 01:10:00,730
I take you

1066
01:10:02,690 --> 01:10:04,110
to be my wife, the Queen.

1067
01:10:05,990 --> 01:10:08,410
-What?
-You just became the reason.

1068
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:11,160
The reason

1069
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:14,540
why I should stay in this world.

1070
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:18,540
Goodness.

1071
01:10:19,380 --> 01:10:24,220
He wasn't half-crazy.
He is completely crazy.

1072
01:11:31,410 --> 01:11:33,330
I have been longing for you for 25 years.

1073
01:11:33,410 --> 01:11:35,450
-Be quiet!
-You will be beheaded for cutting me off.

1074
01:11:35,540 --> 01:11:36,790
I can't stand you!

1075
01:11:36,870 --> 01:11:37,710
What is this logo?

1076
01:11:37,790 --> 01:11:38,670
I left the palace for too long.

1077
01:11:38,750 --> 01:11:40,170
Where are you?

1078
01:11:40,250 --> 01:11:41,500
I can stop time.

1079
01:11:41,710 --> 01:11:44,210
I think it's a side effect
from crossing the gate.
