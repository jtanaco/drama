<b>for you.</b>

158
00:08:29,711 --> 00:08:32,931
<b>All right. It might not be cozy...</b>

159
00:08:32,955 --> 00:08:34,855
<b>but sleep tight.</b>

160
00:08:35,234 --> 00:08:36,512
<b>Are you learning something?</b>

161
00:08:38,656 --> 00:08:39,656
<b>I am.</b>

162
00:08:41,336 --> 00:08:42,336
<b>I see.</b>

163
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:45,271
<b>Goodnight.</b>

164
00:09:01,742 --> 00:09:03,321
<b>Jung Hee,</b>

165
00:09:04,773 --> 00:09:07,006
<b>you went through a lot today.</b>

166
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:11,269
<b>I don't want to be worried...</b>

167
00:09:12,477 --> 00:09:14,373
<b>but I am.</b>

168
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:18,805
<b>But...</b>

169
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:21,848
<b>I think it was a good idea
to bring him over.</b>

170
00:09:21,872 --> 00:09:22,958
<b>Isn't it?</b>

171
00:09:22,982 --> 00:09:24,711
<b>You're right.</b>

172
00:09:27,932 --> 00:09:31,082
<b>Why do you think he went
to the detention center?</b>

173
00:09:33,109 --> 00:09:36,021
<b>He knows how to respect
his elders.</b>

174
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:40,419
<b>He must've had his reasons.</b>

175
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:00,045
<b>Sae Yun didn't...</b>

176
00:10:00,499 --> 00:10:02,368
<b>hide it on purpose.</b>

177
00:10:03,516 --> 00:10:06,439
<b>Sae Yun said Seo Jung left it...</b>

178
00:10:08,383 --> 00:10:09,423
<b>in her cabinet.</b>

179
00:10:10,297 --> 00:10:11,297
<b>Why?</b>

180
00:10:12,101 --> 00:10:13,545
<b>No one knows that.</b>

181
00:10:13,569 --> 00:10:15,590
<b>Just like no one knows why...</b>

182
00:10:16,014 --> 00:10:18,315
<b>she left that sentence to...</b>

183
00:10:18,655 --> 00:10:20,420
<b>you, me...</b>

184
00:10:21,156 --> 00:10:23,281
<b>and Sae Yun.</b>

185
00:10:24,789 --> 00:10:28,453
<b>It seems like Sae Yun went
through a lot too.</b>

186
00:10:30,281 --> 00:10:32,382
<b>She must've felt like
Seo Jung blamed her.</b>

187
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:36,804
<b>That's the scariest thing.</b>

188
00:10:41,466 --> 00:10:43,546
<b>(Seo Jung, what are you up to?</b>

189
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:45,458
<b>(Nothing. I miss you, Don Hyuk.)</b>

190
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:12,544
<b>Are you going out?</b>

191
00:11:13,383 --> 00:11:14,972
<b>Good morning.</b>

192
00:11:15,414 --> 00:11:18,207
<b>What a coincidence!</b>

193
00:11:18,422 --> 00:11:20,115
<b>Stay right where you are.</b>

194
00:11:23,219 --> 00:11:26,335
<b>Chan Hong! Let's go take a bath!</b>

195
00:11:28,434 --> 00:11:30,279
<b>(Won Jam Bathhouse)</b>

196
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,343
<b>(Cold bath)</b>

197
00:11:59,367 --> 00:12:03,539
<b>In lane five, Oh Kyung Pyo.</b>

198
00:12:03,563 --> 00:12:04,785
<b>Thank you, Mom.</b>

199
00:12:26,656 --> 00:12:30,574
<b>You sometimes tend to
make people cowardly.</b>

200
00:12:31,394 --> 00:12:32,816
<b>Do better then.</b>

201
00:12:35,314 --> 00:12:38,072
<b>Don Hyuk, even your skins is fair.</b>

202
00:12:38,096 --> 00:12:41,087
<b>Come on. If I made the call later,
you would've been more hurt.</b>

203
00:12:42,107 --> 00:12:45,076
<b>Not you, them.
I'm worried about them.</b>

204
00:12:45,124 --> 00:12:47,418
<b>I thought your punches
might kill them.</b>

205
00:12:56,878 --> 00:12:58,773
<b>- Can I throw up a bit?
- Go ahead.</b>

206
00:12:59,813 --> 00:13:02,290
<b>Look at this. Are you an eraser?</b>

207
00:13:02,733 --> 00:13:05,661
<b>Take them home. I'll wrap
them up nicely for you.</b>

208
00:13:10,637 --> 00:13:11,730
<b>I feel squeaky clean.</b>

209
00:13:12,281 --> 00:13:14,718
<b>- I'm going to work.
- I'll see you at home.</b>

210
00:13:14,742 --> 00:13:15,742
<b>See you again.</b>

211
00:13:19,266 --> 00:13:20,295
<b>This is from Mom.</b>

212
00:13:27,859 --> 00:13:30,723
<b>Please tell her I said thank you.</b>

213
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,982
<b>A venti for Don Hyuk.</b>

214
00:13:35,469 --> 00:13:37,605
<b>Ninja, you get a tall sized one.</b>

215
00:13:38,242 --> 00:13:40,664
<b>- And a grande for me.
- Hey!</b>

216
00:13:41,023 --> 00:13:42,594
<b>I'm taller than you.</b>

217
00:13:42,867 --> 00:13:44,227
<b>I'm not talking about our heights.</b>

218
00:13:52,016 --> 00:13:53,617
<b>Don Hyuk, you're the man.</b>

219
00:13:55,797 --> 00:13:56,988
<b>Watch yourself.</b>

220
00:14:03,741 --> 00:14:05,241
<b>(What rhythm has taught me)</b>

221
00:14:05,265 --> 00:14:06,426
<b>Rhythm.</b>

222
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:09,905
<b>It is chemistry made from
words that go well with one another.</b>

223
00:14:10,781 --> 00:14:14,356
<b>If you were to leave me,
for I disgust you,</b>

224
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:18,046
<b>I will send you off...</b>

225
00:14:18,609 --> 00:14:20,065
<b>quietly.</b>

226
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:24,087
<b>The poem has a certain rhythm to it.</b>

227
00:14:24,111 --> 00:14:26,732
<b>It has a sonnet's rhythm.</b>

228
00:14:26,756 --> 00:14:28,226
<b>This goes for you too.</b>

229
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,795
<b>If you keep writing poetry...</b>

230
00:14:30,819 --> 00:14:33,188
<b>you will develop a rhythm.</b>

231
00:14:33,212 --> 00:14:36,678
<b>Your very own rhythm.</b>

232
00:14:36,702 --> 00:14:37,566
<b>So this rhythm...</b>

233
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:39,003
<b>We are at a roadblock.</b>

234
00:14:39,789 --> 00:14:41,265
<b>Is there a way?</b>

235
00:14:41,329 --> 00:14:44,738
<b>If you get used to this breathing,
it will stick with you...</b>

236
00:14:44,762 --> 00:14:46,642
<b>so you can't change it.</b>

237
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:48,944
<b>I thought of something while reading
through the chats.</b>

238
00:14:48,968 --> 00:14:53,010
<b>So even without a base, you can
develop a rhythm. Isn't it amazing?</b>

239
00:14:58,422 --> 00:14:59,422
<b>Hello.</b>

240
00:15:00,391 --> 00:15:02,129
<b>- From yesterday...
- I see.</b>

241
00:15:02,609 --> 00:15:04,133
<b>Hey, the runaways.</b>

242
00:15:07,336 --> 00:15:09,585
<b>Go make the world a cleaner place.</b>

243
00:15:11,474 --> 00:15:12,474
<b>Go on.</b>

244
00:15:14,359 --> 00:15:17,108
<b>Wait, look at them.</b>

245
00:15:17,734 --> 00:15:19,945
<b>This is a total cacophony.</b>

246
00:15:19,969 --> 00:15:20,986
<b>But how is it?</b>

247
00:15:21,578 --> 00:15:23,999
<b>There is an exquisite rhythm
to them.</b>

248
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:27,713
<b>Sometimes, the things that are
so finely mismatched...</b>

249
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:31,608
<b>create an exquisite rhythm.</b>

250
00:15:33,297 --> 00:15:35,630
<b>So, they stole
someone else's photo...</b>

251
00:15:36,313 --> 00:15:37,662
<b>and pretended to be like them?</b>

252
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:39,547
<b>But their faces must be different.</b>

253
00:15:40,086 --> 00:15:41,663
<b>Seo Jung would have been more alert.</b>

254
00:15:41,687 --> 00:15:43,249
<b>That's simple.</b>

255
00:15:45,547 --> 00:15:48,221
<b>You were going to meet
with Hyun Gu, right?</b>

256
00:15:49,956 --> 00:15:50,956
<b>Yes.</b>

257
00:15:51,281 --> 00:15:54,167
<b>Are you the friend that
he mentioned?</b>

258
00:15:54,805 --> 00:15:55,962
<b>Yes, I'm his friend.</b>

259
00:15:55,986 --> 00:15:57,704
<b>He must have looked nice.</b>

260
00:15:57,728 --> 00:16:00,503
<b>But Seo Jung seemed a bit drunk.</b>

261
00:16:00,593 --> 00:16:02,248
<b>She can't drink at all.</b>

262
00:16:02,438 --> 00:16:03,887
<b>They must have drugged her.</b>

263
00:16:06,133 --> 00:16:08,614
<b>Have this while you wait.
He'll be here soon.</b>

264
00:16:09,098 --> 00:16:11,147
<b>Okay. Thank you.</b>

265
00:16:15,718 --> 00:16:18,765
<b>Then they took a photo
and exploited her.</b>

266
00:16:21,016 --> 00:16:22,386
<b>Let's go catch them.</b>

267
00:16:23,203 --> 00:16:26,613
<b>High schoolers have no money.
How did she make it through?</b>

268
00:16:27,805 --> 00:16:30,618
<b>I would've done anything
to come up with the money. Right?</b>

269
00:16:30,862 --> 00:16:32,508
<b>- Be quiet.
- What?</b>

270
00:16:37,016 --> 00:16:38,458
<b>Let's split up and clean.</b>

271
00:16:39,577 --> 00:16:42,437
<b>Don Hyuk, you should get some rest.
Ninja and I will do it.</b>

272
00:16:42,531 --> 00:16:43,736
<b>Please!</b>

273
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:44,760
<b>What?</b>

274
00:16:57,781 --> 00:16:58,781
<b>There's been...</b>

275
00:17:00,969 --> 00:17:02,520
<b>something at the back of my mind.</b>

276
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:14,227
<b>This is what Seo Jung wrote
on the internet.</b>

277
00:17:18,141 --> 00:17:20,879
<b>I wanted to think that she didn't
write this...</b>

278
00:17:22,047 --> 00:17:23,744
<b>but the ID and IP match.</b>

279
00:17:25,852 --> 00:17:27,413
<b>If this was Seo Jung...</b>

280
00:17:29,328 --> 00:17:30,328
<b>Well...</b>

281
00:17:31,749 --> 00:17:33,622
<b>- That is if..
- She didn't.</b>

282
00:17:36,867 --> 00:17:39,192
<b>She was someone
Sae Yun looked up to...</b>

283
00:17:40,413 --> 00:17:42,239
<b>and she was someone you liked.</b>

284
00:17:45,664 --> 00:17:48,256
<b>Don Hyuk, it can't be.</b>

285
00:18:06,656 --> 00:18:08,993
<b>You don't come
to cram school these days.</b>

286
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,708
<b>Is there something going on?</b>

287
00:18:12,734 --> 00:18:15,959
<b>No, there isn't. Nothing's going on.</b>

288
00:18:17,891 --> 00:18:19,328
<b>That's good to hear.</b>

289
00:18:19,922 --> 00:18:22,746
<b>I thought maybe
giving you the phone...</b>

290
00:18:23,031 --> 00:18:26,371
<b>caused you harm. I was worried.</b>

291
00:18:28,203 --> 00:18:31,205
<b>Don't be. I have it nice and safe.</b>

292
00:18:33,054 --> 00:18:35,962
<b>Come to cram school today.
I'll see you there.</b>

293
00:18:37,898 --> 00:18:38,936
<b>Sae Yun.</b>

294
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,500
<b>Yes?</b>

295
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:44,115
<b>I won't be going there for a while.</b>

296
00:18:44,139 --> 00:18:45,200
<b>Why?</b>

297
00:18:45,224 --> 00:18:46,583
<b>I don't have any money.</b>

298
00:18:46,607 --> 00:18:47,636
<b>The thing is...</b>

299
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,871
<b>If my mom finds out, she'll kill me.</b>

300
00:18:50,281 --> 00:18:52,356
<b>Are you going to become
a full-time writer?</b>

301
00:18:52,953 --> 00:18:56,245
<b>- No, that's not it.
- That must be it!</b>

302
00:18:56,269 --> 00:18:59,393
<b>Chan Hong, that's great!</b>

303
00:18:59,969 --> 00:19:02,468
<b>I'll root for you. Happy writing!</b>

304
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:04,140
<b>I'll get going.</b>

305
00:19:09,109 --> 00:19:10,818
<b>You've improved so much.</b>

306
00:19:10,842 --> 00:19:12,866
<b>The student has become the master.</b>

307
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:15,296
<b>You know what most surprising?</b>

308
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,500
<b>Even if I read this with
your name covered,</b>

309
00:19:18,422 --> 00:19:21,867
<b>I can still feel Chan Hong's rhythm.</b>

310
00:19:22,016 --> 00:19:23,357
<b>This is very good.</b>

311
00:19:24,617 --> 00:19:26,552
<b>I'll keep this safe.</b>

<b>There is a way.</b>

473
00:33:02,721 --> 00:33:03,922
<b>The cabinet is...</b>

474

<b>As I said, I can't do that.</b>

479

<b>You know how they write. Why would

<b>May I please have a word with you?</b>

<b>I guess it's because you're a writer.</b>

<b>Mi Ra's not doing well these days.</b>

<b>It's kind of awkward with her.</b>
