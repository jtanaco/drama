<b>Enough.</b>

162
00:16:58,721 --> 00:17:00,162
<b>(Dressing Room, Kang In Wook)</b>

163
00:17:27,252 --> 00:17:29,391
<b>I thought it was...</b>

164
00:17:30,151 --> 00:17:32,692
<b>because of the strong wind and snow.</b>

165
00:17:33,962 --> 00:17:35,532
<b>But that wasn't the reason.</b>

166
00:17:36,492 --> 00:17:38,502
<b>It was because of Kang In Wook.</b>

167
00:17:43,871 --> 00:17:45,841
<b>I need to take revenge,</b>

168
00:17:47,302 --> 00:17:49,811
<b>but I've never done it before, so I don't know how.</b>

169
00:17:51,782 --> 00:17:53,811
<b>Should I break his fingers?</b>

170
00:17:55,182 --> 00:17:57,351
<b>How should I do it?</b>

171
00:17:59,182 --> 00:18:00,821
<b>Why does it feel like...</b>

172
00:18:02,591 --> 00:18:04,861
<b>everything I do is in vain?</b>

173
00:18:06,962 --> 00:18:07,962
<b>Hey.</b>

174
00:18:09,061 --> 00:18:10,532
<b>Don't be sad.</b>

175

<b>Don't let everything lead to sadness.</b>

176

<b>Being sad when you should be angry or annoyed...</b>

177
00:18:18,202 --> 00:18:19,442
<b>is bad for you.</b>

178

<b>It's okay to be angry. Be brave.</b>

179

<b>What was that?</b>

180
00:19:27,442 --> 00:19:28,742
<b>Good work.</b>

181

<b>Bye.</b>

182
00:21:00,561 --> 00:21:01,901
<b>What's going on?</b>

183
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:04,542
<b>I suddenly felt the urge to call.</b>

184
00:21:05,202 --> 00:21:07,002
<b>You are amazing.</b>

185
00:21:08,012 --> 00:21:11,611
<b>Soon Ho called. She told me to call you.</b>

186
00:21:12,841 --> 00:21:14,311
<b>That you're having a really hard time.</b>

187

<b>What is it?</b>

188
00:21:21,952 --> 00:21:23,192
<b>Tell me about my mom.</b>

189
00:21:23,651 --> 00:21:26,292
<b>You wouldn't let me talk about her.</b>

190
00:21:26,762 --> 00:21:28,232
<b>You were determined to forget her.</b>

191
00:21:30,232 --> 00:21:32,401
<b>I thought I'd remember clearly even if I were determined,</b>

192
00:21:34,061 --> 00:21:35,532
<b>but I'm afraid I really will forget her.</b>

193
00:21:37,502 --> 00:21:38,601
<b>I want to hear about her.</b>

194
00:21:39,571 --> 00:21:42,811
<b>Of course. She was such a beautiful person.</b>

195
00:21:43,272 --> 00:21:44,682
<b>How could you forget such a person?</b>

196
00:21:46,111 --> 00:21:47,411
<b>Ms. Im Su Ock...</b>

197
00:21:49,611 --> 00:21:52,522
<b>was cheerful, strong, beautiful,</b>

198
00:21:52,752 --> 00:21:54,252
<b>played the piano beautifully...</b>

199
00:21:56,522 --> 00:21:59,992
<b>She couldn't cook though. Her snacks were not very good.</b>

200
00:22:01,061 --> 00:22:02,361
<b>She said her cooking wouldn't improve...</b>

201
00:22:02,361 --> 00:22:04,601
<b>because you ate everything well.</b>

202
00:22:05,002 --> 00:22:06,032
<b>That's right.</b>

203
00:22:09,502 --> 00:22:10,631
<b>Need help?</b>

204
00:22:12,101 --> 00:22:14,242
<b>With what? I'm not doing anything.</b>

205
00:22:14,371 --> 00:22:15,411
<b>Sit with me.</b>

206
00:22:16,512 --> 00:22:18,482
<b>What should we have for breakfast?</b>

207
00:22:18,982 --> 00:22:20,811
<b>Should I make sandwiches?</b>

208
00:22:22,081 --> 00:22:25,421
<b>If you make something that you had never made for breakfast before,</b>

209
00:22:25,421 --> 00:22:28,192
<b>would Chang Sup think it was special...</b>

210
00:22:28,192 --> 00:22:30,692
<b>or your way of giving him the finger?</b>

211
00:22:33,722 --> 00:22:36,692
<b>He'd like it because it's something new and different.</b>

212
00:22:36,692 --> 00:22:37,792
<b>He's simple like that.</b>

213
00:22:50,411 --> 00:22:52,542
<b>I've been taking this path for so many years.</b>

214
00:23:38,821 --> 00:23:39,992
<b>I guess you wished...</b>

215
00:23:40,921 --> 00:23:43,292
<b>someone would do this for you when things were tough.</b>

216
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:48,601
<b>Don't you feel like you're being supported?</b>

217
00:23:49,371 --> 00:23:51,802
<b>Helping you maintain your balance.</b>

218
00:23:53,772 --> 00:23:57,012
<b>I'm going to stay like this. I won't let go.</b>

219
00:24:11,591 --> 00:24:12,661
<b>I know...</b>

220
00:24:13,292 --> 00:24:15,591
<b>what I have to do...</b>

221
00:24:16,492 --> 00:24:17,661
<b>to make myself happy.</b>

222
00:24:19,002 --> 00:24:21,002
<b>I care so much about myself.</b>

223
00:24:23,772 --> 00:24:26,571
<b>First, I go early in the morning.</b>

224
00:24:27,401 --> 00:24:29,272
<b>There's no one in the building.</b>

225
00:24:30,042 --> 00:24:32,341
<b>I open the door myself, air out the place,</b>

226
00:24:33,841 --> 00:24:35,311
<b>make coffee,</b>

227
00:24:35,311 --> 00:24:37,081
<b>and play music recorded the day before.</b>

228
00:24:37,581 --> 00:24:39,452
<b>Then I hold my cup of coffee...</b>

229
00:24:40,222 --> 00:24:42,792
<b>and take my first sip while looking out the window.</b>

230
00:24:44,192 --> 00:24:45,262
<b>It's awesome.</b>

231
00:24:47,192 --> 00:24:48,391
<b>What about you?</b>

232
00:24:52,732 --> 00:24:53,861
<b>I'm thinking.</b>

233
00:24:57,871 --> 00:24:59,972
<b>You have to research and put in the effort...</b>

234
00:24:59,972 --> 00:25:01,712
<b>to figure out what you must do to make yourself happy.</b>

235
00:25:02,141 --> 00:25:04,311
<b>It won't just fall on your lap.</b>

236
00:25:04,742 --> 00:25:05,811
<b>Think hard about it.</b>

237
00:25:06,381 --> 00:25:07,881
<b>Tell me another one of yours.</b>

238
00:25:10,682 --> 00:25:14,052
<b>On my way home, I look back,</b>

239
00:25:15,052 --> 00:25:17,391
<b>and there's a beautiful sunset.</b>

240
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:19,061
<b>I can picture it.</b>

241
00:25:20,462 --> 00:25:21,561
<b>Another one.</b>

242
00:25:24,532 --> 00:25:26,762
<b>When I go to work at the same time as usual,</b>

243
00:25:27,932 --> 00:25:31,331
<b>but whereas it was dark yesterday, it's bright today.</b>

244
00:25:33,141 --> 00:25:36,141
<b>The way the world knows to change with the seasons.</b>

245
00:25:36,371 --> 00:25:37,871
<b>I like seeing that.</b>

246
00:25:39,411 --> 00:25:41,282
<b>It's slightly different.</b>

247
00:25:41,712 --> 00:25:44,012
<b>It's like playing "Red light, green light"...</b>

248

<b>with the world.</b>

249
00:25:48,192 --> 00:25:49,651
<b>I thought of something that I like.</b>

250
00:25:51,621 --> 00:25:53,361
<b>Listening to things you like.</b>

251
00:25:59,962 --> 00:26:01,161
<b>Do you want to say something?</b>

252
00:26:11,742 --> 00:26:14,311
<b>I don't like that many things.</b>

253
00:26:15,182 --> 00:26:16,311
<b>What else is there?</b>

254
00:26:17,252 --> 00:26:18,351
<b>Let's see.</b>

255
00:26:20,581 --> 00:26:21,651
<b>The studio.</b>

256
00:26:22,552 --> 00:26:25,561
<b>Listening to the best musicians perform before my very eyes...</b>

257
00:26:25,861 --> 00:26:29,192
<b>using the best sound equipment.</b>

258
00:26:30,061 --> 00:26:31,091
<b>I love it.</b>

259
00:26:34,302 --> 00:26:35,432
<b>I'd like to see it too.</b>

260
00:26:46,712 --> 00:26:48,611
<b>What? What's that?</b>

261
00:26:51,052 --> 00:26:53,552
<b>It keeps lingering in my head, but I don't know what it is.</b>

262
00:26:55,022 --> 00:26:56,692
<b>My mom used to play it.</b>

263

<b>Keep going.</b>

<b>It's very short.</b>

265
00:27:02,631 --> 00:27:03,992
<b>I can find it.</b>

266
00:27:15,272 --> 00:27:18,581
<b>I promise to find it and play it for you.</b>

267

<b>On the piano.</b>

320
00:31:28,432 --> 00:31:30,861
<b>That's right. So be thankful to your parents.</b>

321
00:31:31,091 --> 00:31:33,161
<b>You run the homestay.</b>

322
00:31:33,202 --> 00:31:35,302
<b>Awesome. I bet you'd be awesome.</b>

323
00:31:35,302 --> 00:31:37,071
<b>Jin Soo, you be my witness.</b>

324
00:31:37,131 --> 00:31:38,171
<b>I'm in.</b>

325
00:31:40,641 --> 00:31:42,542
<b>I'll bum around in my room,</b>

326
00:31:42,542 --> 00:31:44,141
<b>and take half the rent.</b>

327
00:31:44,141 --> 00:31:45,182
<b>I'm out.</b>

328
00:31:45,182 --> 00:31:47,012
<b>See? You don't want to do it either.</b>

329
00:31:47,081 --> 00:31:48,651
<b>Exactly.</b>

330
00:31:49,012 --> 00:31:51,952
<b>Think about why you're doing this.</b>

331
00:31:51,952 --> 00:31:53,351
<b>Once you do,</b>

332
00:31:53,351 --> 00:31:55,821
<b>if you question later why you're doing this,</b>

333
00:31:55,821 --> 00:31:57,591
<b>you can tell yourself.</b>

334
00:32:00,121 --> 00:32:01,161
<b>Chang Sup.</b>

335
00:32:01,522 --> 00:32:02,861
<b>Are you moving back home?</b>

336
00:32:03,432 --> 00:32:05,331
<b>So you remember.</b>

337
00:32:06,462 --> 00:32:08,532
<b>No one seems to care.</b>

338
00:32:08,532 --> 00:32:10,171
<b>No goodbyes.</b>

339
00:32:10,901 --> 00:32:13,202
<b>They only talk about life.</b>

340
00:32:13,202 --> 00:32:14,502
<b>Although it's the last time.</b>

341
00:32:15,111 --> 00:32:17,012
<b>- You can finish. - "Last time"?</b>

342
00:32:17,012 --> 00:32:18,272
<b>Are you dying tomorrow?</b>

343
00:32:18,542 --> 00:32:20,442
<b>Watch what you say.</b>

344
00:32:21,311 --> 00:32:22,581
<b>Are you moving back home?</b>

345
00:32:22,581 --> 00:32:24,452
<b>It's a two-hour commute.</b>

346
00:32:24,581 --> 00:32:26,952
<b>Bus, subway, then another bus...</b>

347
00:32:26,952 --> 00:32:28,321
<b>Just wake up early.</b>

348
00:32:28,321 --> 00:32:30,192
<b>You don't know how I feel.</b>

349
00:32:33,992 --> 00:32:35,262
<b>This precious thing...</b>

350
00:32:35,792 --> 00:32:37,262
<b>Thank you.</b>

351
00:32:42,532 --> 00:32:46,341
<b>I gave Chang Sup two pieces of your mom's pickled vegetable.</b>

352
00:32:47,002 --> 00:32:49,071
<b>It's his last breakfast.</b>

353
00:32:51,071 --> 00:32:54,811
<b>Good thinking. He likes that.</b>

354
00:32:54,811 --> 00:32:56,182
<b>You did very well.</b>

355
00:33:17,831 --> 00:33:19,641
<b>Okay, good going, Uncle.</b>

356
00:33:19,641 --> 00:33:21,542
<b>You should screen my calls if you're mad.</b>

357
00:33:21,542 --> 00:33:24,242
<b>Good going.</b>

358
00:33:35,821 --> 00:33:37,722
<b>I knew you'd be like this.</b>

359
00:33:37,722 --> 00:33:39,992
<b>I came to drag you out.</b>

360
00:33:40,891 --> 00:33:44,262
<b>Let's go. Get some sun, and let's go eat.</b>

361
00:33:44,692 --> 00:33:46,401
<b>What's nearby?</b>

362
00:33:46,901 --> 00:33:47,932
<b>Soon Ho.</b>

363
00:33:50,631 --> 00:33:51,871
<b>Stop now.</b>

364
00:33:52,171 --> 00:33:53,702
<b>Stop what?</b>

365
00:33:55,101 --> 00:33:56,472
<b>You don't have to do this.</b>

366
00:33:56,472 --> 00:33:58,682
<b>I have something to say to you. Let's go.</b>

367
00:34:01,141 --> 00:34:04,712
<b>Many people who went to the recital posted online.</b>

368
00:34:05,321 --> 00:34:07,921
<b>It was a humiliating recital, but you did it well.</b>

369
00:34:09,521 --> 00:34:11,151
<b>You should be proud of yourself.</b>

370
00:34:11,151 --> 00:34:12,762
<b>You prepared long and hard for it.</b>

371
00:34:13,821 --> 00:34:15,932
<b>I'll put together the nice comments and send them to you.</b>

372
00:34:15,932 --> 00:34:17,231
<b>Look through them and cheer up.</b>

373
00:34:19,001 --> 00:34:20,532
<b>Is that everything you wanted to say?</b>

374
00:34:21,032 --> 00:34:22,571
<b>Go see my uncle.</b>

375
00:34:23,832 --> 00:34:26,642
<b>See him and lay down your burden.</b>

376
00:34:26,841 --> 00:34:28,202
<b>I'll help you.</b>

377
00:34:28,642 --> 00:34:29,941
<b>If I see him...</b>

378
00:34:32,812 --> 00:34:34,611
<b>and apologize, will it be over?</b>

379
00:34:34,912 --> 00:34:36,751
<b>Ask him in person.</b>

380
00:34:36,751 --> 00:34:38,251
<b>"Will it be over if I apologize?"</b>

381
00:34:38,722 --> 00:34:42,021
<b>Do you know what thought I keep having over and over?</b>

382
00:34:42,791 --> 00:34:44,021
<b>I wonder...</b>

383
00:34:46,162 --> 00:34:47,861
<b>if Ha Won and Ji Soo met.</b>

384
00:34:52,202 --> 00:34:54,832
<b>Why are you thinking about that?</b>

385
00:34:56,832 --> 00:34:58,071
<b>Right?</b>

386
00:34:59,841 --> 00:35:02,571
<b>It makes no sense, but that's all I can think about.</b>

387
00:35:03,541 --> 00:35:06,242
<b>Ji Soo went to that house in Wokin-dong.</b>

388
00:35:07,582 --> 00:35:09,151
<b>No, she didn't go, but...</b>

389
00:35:09,151 --> 00:35:10,452
<b>She didn't go there.</b>

390
00:35:11,312 --> 00:35:12,981
<b>She never went there.</b>

391
00:35:14,421 --> 00:35:15,622
<b>I see.</b>

392
00:35:15,622 --> 00:35:17,421
<b>Stop thinking things like that.</b>

393
00:35:17,622 --> 00:35:19,791
<b>Think only about what you did yesterday.</b>

394
00:35:20,521 --> 00:35:23,791
<b>One, you gave a wonderful recital.</b>

395
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:26,401
<b>Two, my uncle.</b>

396
00:35:27,332 --> 00:35:31,202
<b>If you are miserable right now, that should be why.</b>

397
00:35:31,631 --> 00:35:33,102
<b>This is who I am.</b>

398
00:35:34,742 --> 00:35:37,041
<b>This is why Ji Soo was miserable.</b>

399
00:35:38,941 --> 00:35:41,611
<b>If I were supposed to change, I should've changed much sooner.</b>

400
00:35:43,912 --> 00:35:45,852
<b>Your question doesn't deserve an answer,</b>

401
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:47,352
<b>but they did not meet.</b>

402
00:35:48,122 --> 00:35:51,251
<b>And give your life, your all...</b>

403
00:35:51,921 --> 00:35:53,722
<b>to free yourself from that thought.</b>

404
00:35:54,222 --> 00:35:55,631
<b>I'll try.</b>

405
00:35:55,832 --> 00:35:58,091
<b>I said to give your life, your all.</b>

406
00:35:59,802 --> 00:36:01,332
<b>My uncle...</b>

407
00:36:02,731 --> 00:36:05,671
<b>has nothing, has no one...</b>

408
00:36:06,441 --> 00:36:08,102
<b>He was dumped by Ji Soo,</b>

409
00:36:08,102 --> 00:36:11,211
<b>who was like family, whom he thought would be family forever.</b>

410
00:36:11,541 --> 00:36:14,312
<b>He went through all sorts of hardships and heartbreaks,</b>

411
00:36:14,312 --> 00:36:16,981
<b>but he works desperately to stay focused and protect himself.</b>

412
00:36:17,552 --> 00:36:19,921
<b>He doesn't know how to abandon himself.</b>

413
00:36:20,952 --> 00:36:22,821
<b>That's what it means to give your life, your all.</b>

414
00:36:25,191 --> 00:36:28,521
<b>I watched him for 10 long years. No, 9 years.</b>

415
00:36:29,062 --> 00:36:30,662
<b>I keep adding a year.</b>

416
00:36:33,731 --> 00:36:35,001
<b>That's...</b>

417
00:36:37,832 --> 00:36:39,642
<b>how my uncle...</b>

418
00:36:40,372 --> 00:36:42,242
<b>spent the last nine years...</b>

419
00:36:43,571 --> 00:36:45,582
<b>because of that one thing you said.</b>

420
00:37:29,521 --> 00:37:31,722
<b>(From Kim Ji Soo)</b>

421
00:37:43,802 --> 00:37:44,901
<b>(From Kim Ji Soo)</b>

422
00:38:04,052 --> 00:38:08,321
<b>Grandma. Tell Uncle to come home and eat.</b>

423
00:38:09,062 --> 00:38:11,892
<b>He's having a hard time right now. He may die.</b>

424
00:38:11,892 --> 00:38:13,302
<b>You call him.</b>

425
00:38:13,302 --> 00:38:16,432
<b>Call him for me. I can't face him.</b>

426
00:38:16,532 --> 00:38:18,131
<b>No, I won't.</b>

427
00:38:19,302 --> 00:38:20,541
<b>Not now.</b>

428
00:38:20,541 --> 00:38:22,242
<b>Call him anyway.</b>

429
00:38:36,421 --> 00:38:37,852
<b>I'm early.</b>

430
00:38:38,321 --> 00:38:40,321
<b>I thought the engineer was a woman.</b>

431
00:38:40,321 --> 00:38:42,361
<b>I'm not an engineer.</b>

432
00:38:43,631 --> 00:38:45,332
<b>I'm going up first.</b>

433
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:47,062
<b>But...</b>

<b>(28 Device - voice)</b>

<b>Voice?</b>

<b>100 test subjects.</b>

437
00:39:30,472 --> 00:39:32,211
<b>I'm the 100th.</b>

438
00:39:32,242 --> 00:39:33,711
<b>It'll be done after me.</b>

439
00:39:35,082 --> 00:39:37,651
<b>Yes. The test.</b>

<b>A conversation device...</b>

<b>with that person's personality, emotions, and voice.</b>

444
00:39:49,291 --> 00:39:51,291
<b>The studio is dry.</b>

445
00:39:51,731 --> 00:39:53,162
<b>You're the manager, right? Is there any water?</b>

446
00:39:55,062 --> 00:39:57,631
<b>Yes. I'll be right back.</b>

447
00:40:14,352 --> 00:40:16,222
<b>What broke?</b>

448
00:40:27,702 --> 00:40:28,802
<b>What is that?</b>

449
00:40:29,901 --> 00:40:31,972
<b>My bag fell.</b>

450
00:40:32,841 --> 00:40:35,941
<b>How does she know the house has good acoustics?</b>

451
00:40:35,941 --> 00:40:37,341
<b>She has been there.</b>

452
00:40:39,111 --> 00:40:41,981
<b>Well. To be exact, she wasn't there herself.</b>

453
00:40:42,082 --> 00:40:44,751
<b>I must have lost my mind. I'm hearing things.</b>

<b>A large company uses our studio too.</b>

<b>Ji Soo's device.</b>

<b>Didn't you say a large company...</b>

461

<b>was collecting voices before?</b>

462

<b>That's what you told me when I said I was hearing voices.</b>

<b>You said a large company hired the studio...</b>

<b>Which company? Why?</b>

<b>This is important.</b>

466
00:41:24,573 --> 00:41:26,282
<b>- This... - It is not important.</b>

467
00:41:27,642 --> 00:41:30,313
<b>I thought you were going to apologize,</b>

<b>I wish someone would water me...</b>

<b>and give me sunlight.</b>

483

<b>When did you get a caretaker's license?</b>

484
00:43:09,352 --> 00:43:12,012
<b>I was always preparing for the future.</b>

485
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:14,253
<b>I should've...</b>

487

<b>What do you mean?</b>

488
00:43:20,323 --> 00:43:22,332
<b>She loved how hard you worked.</b>

489
00:43:22,762 --> 00:43:24,063
<b>She said so in her comments.</b>

490
00:43:24,233 --> 00:43:27,403
<b>She loved how busy your life was.</b>

491

<b>She was so proud of you for being efficient...</b>

<b>and working hard.</b>

493

<b>She said every second of the day was precious to her,</b>

494
00:43:37,543 --> 00:43:39,213
<b>and that it was how her mom lived too.</b>

495
00:43:43,483 --> 00:43:45,782
<b>Your daughter has an awesome name.</b>

496
00:43:45,782 --> 00:43:47,952
<b>I fought so much with my in-laws because of that.</b>

497
00:43:47,952 --> 00:43:49,653
<b>- What? - They said no.</b>

498
00:43:49,653 --> 00:43:51,093
<b>They said any name but that.</b>

499
00:43:51,352 --> 00:43:52,863
<b>They hated the name.</b>

500
00:43:53,262 --> 00:43:54,492
<b>What's wrong with Eun Joo?</b>

501
00:43:55,463 --> 00:43:57,293
<b>Most of the Eun Joos out there...</b>

502

<b>are successful and happy.</b>

503
00:43:59,003 --> 00:44:01,633
<b>- You gave her a great name. - Don't say her name.</b>

504
00:44:02,633 --> 00:44:04,133
<b>You came to Eun Joo's house.</b>

505
00:44:06,343 --> 00:44:07,773
<b>So you have to be happy.</b>

506
00:44:07,972 --> 00:44:09,972
<b>Doubly happy for my daughter's sake.</b>

<b>You'd better.</b>

509
00:44:14,242 --> 00:44:15,512
<b>For the next week,</b>

510

<b>I'm going to be super nice.</b>

511
00:44:19,452 --> 00:44:22,052
<b>I'll make sure you can never ever forget Eunjoo Homestay.</b>

512
00:44:22,222 --> 00:44:23,722
<b>People forget so easily, don't they?</b>

513
00:44:24,122 --> 00:44:26,892
<b>They act like this is the best place when they're here, but...</b>

514
00:44:28,323 --> 00:44:30,063
<b>That won't be you though.</b>

515
00:44:30,762 --> 00:44:33,762
<b>Don't try so hard. Once I leave, it'll be goodbye forever.</b>

516
00:44:34,702 --> 00:44:36,332
<b>That's how I survive.</b>

517

<b>I'll make sure you can't forget.</b>

518

<b>Why are you telling me things you want to say to Chang Sup?</b>

519
00:44:40,673 --> 00:44:42,512
<b>Wait and see. You will...</b>

520

<b>Where?</b>

522
00:45:00,662 --> 00:45:01,762
<b>Let's see.</b>

<b>Here?</b>

524
00:45:06,802 --> 00:45:08,832
<b>There. Found it.</b>

525
00:45:09,602 --> 00:45:10,602
<b>What is that?</b>

526
00:45:11,372 --> 00:45:12,972
<b>We have stuff like that?</b>

527
00:45:12,972 --> 00:45:15,073
<b>See? You do have stuff like this.</b>

528
00:45:15,742 --> 00:45:17,313
<b>Do you want to exercise?</b>

529
00:45:19,682 --> 00:45:20,813
<b>Here. Gosh.</b>

530
00:45:21,843 --> 00:45:23,983
<b>Why couldn't you get that? Gosh.</b>

531

<b>- There. - Gosh.</b>

532
00:45:27,082 --> 00:45:28,082
<b>There.</b>

533
00:45:28,682 --> 00:45:30,593
<b>You need to move.</b>

534
00:45:31,622 --> 00:45:32,662
<b>Gosh.</b>

<b>Get ready. Here it comes.</b>

536

<b>- This is boring. - It is?</b>

<b>Do you want to have fun? Was that it?</b>

538
00:45:45,633 --> 00:45:48,573
<b>I'll give you fun. Goodness. I'll give you fun.</b>

539
00:45:48,573 --> 00:45:49,813
<b>Here it comes.</b>

540
00:45:50,943 --> 00:45:51,972
<b>Okay.</b>

541

<b>- What are you doing? - Watch carefully...</b>

542
00:45:56,753 --> 00:45:59,122
<b>Jin Soo. Do you know how to play badminton?</b>

543
00:45:59,483 --> 00:46:01,153
<b>Of course. I'm really good.</b>

544
00:46:01,153 --> 00:46:03,452
<b>Don't be good. Be fun.</b>

545
00:46:05,253 --> 00:46:07,593
<b>I don't know about fun, but I am really good.</b>

<b>- Try it. - Come at me.</b>

547

<b>Is this funny?</b>

548
00:46:18,273 --> 00:46:19,503
<b>Hold on.</b>

549
00:46:20,702 --> 00:46:22,003
<b>This is funny?</b>

550
00:46:22,372 --> 00:46:23,642
<b>One more try.</b>

551
00:46:25,883 --> 00:46:27,182
<b>Hold on.</b>

552
00:46:29,582 --> 00:46:31,282
<b>How did it go backwards?</b>

553

<b>Uncle. Koreans get energy from rice.</b>

<b>(From Kim Ji Soo, To Moon Jung Sook)</b>

<b>I recently realized that you have two addresses.</b>

556
00:47:53,202 --> 00:47:55,633
<b>I guess I was relieved but disappointed...</b>

557

<b>that you weren't reading my letters.</b>

558

<b>I'm sending one final letter.</b>

559

<b>This is the decision that I made...</b>

560
00:48:05,313 --> 00:48:08,343
<b>after struggling with it for a very long time.</b>

561

<b>I'm in pain because of his regret.</b>

562

<b>His tears hurt me.</b>

563
00:48:17,653 --> 00:48:18,923
<b>I want to tell him,</b>

564
00:48:19,863 --> 00:48:22,593
<b>"It's okay. You can stop struggling."</b>

565

<b>I want to be a strength to In Wook.</b>

<b>Now that I've made this decision, I feel at peace.</b>

<b>Take care of yourself, Ms. Moon.</b>

<b>Yours, Kim Ji Soo.</b>

<b>You need to connect with the device for the personality to surface.</b>

573
00:49:02,733 --> 00:49:05,702
<b>You need to bring about a situation to share with the device.</b>

574
00:49:06,702 --> 00:49:08,403
<b>The personality reacts according to the situation,</b>

575

<b>in which we can find the feelings.</b>

576
00:49:10,872 --> 00:49:12,512
<b>Shouldn't we lead it systematically?</b>

577
00:49:13,713 --> 00:49:14,742
<b>No.</b>

578
00:49:16,383 --> 00:49:18,352
<b>You have to make it believe it has feelings.</b>

579
00:49:18,512 --> 00:49:20,023
<b>We stimulate it...</b>

580

<b>to touch upon a nerve,</b>

581

<b>The situation is brought upon by the device itself as well.</b>

<b>I want to go singing now.</b>

638

<b>Just sing instead.</b>

640
00:56:39,857 --> 00:56:42,187
<b>No, no. I'm worse at singing.</b>

641
00:56:43,556 --> 00:56:44,826
<b>My gosh.</b>

642
00:56:55,096 --> 00:56:56,507

<b>You smiled.</b>

646
00:57:53,357 --> 00:57:56,497
<b>And said to me.</b>

647
00:58:00,866 --> 00:58:04,837
<b>I want to fly away.</b>

648
00:58:05,507 --> 00:58:08,736

<b>Bravo.</b>

650
00:58:38,766 --> 00:58:40,076
<b>What about the second verse?</b>

651
00:58:40,306 --> 00:58:41,437
<b>I want to hear it.</b>

652
00:58:44,507 --> 00:58:46,306
<b>I wanted to do well.</b>

653
00:58:46,306 --> 00:58:48,176
<b>I should've recorded it properly.</b>

654

655
00:58:49,986 --> 00:58:51,187
<b>This?</b>

656
00:58:52,886 --> 00:58:53,957
<b>Well,</b>

657
00:58:54,286 --> 00:58:56,826

658
00:58:57,386 --> 00:58:58,486
<b>Well,</b>

659
00:58:58,486 --> 00:59:01,596
<b>I think I'm better when you consider how much time I had to practice.</b>

660
00:59:02,797 --> 00:59:03,997
<b>I can't agree with that.</b>

661
00:59:06,636 --> 00:59:09,937
<b>I'll practice more and record it for you.</b>

662
00:59:10,406 --> 00:59:11,866
<b>Take it to Oslo.</b>

663
00:59:14,977 --> 00:59:16,136
<b>You should go with me.</b>

<b>Grandma called, right?</b>

683
01:01:23,766 --> 01:01:25,036
<b>I told her to.</b>

684

<b>What's this? Are you playing hard to get?</b>

693
01:02:00,036 --> 01:02:02,176
<b>You should repent properly.</b>

<b>You know I can't think straight when I like someone.</b>

699

<b>You really are repenting, right?</b>

700
01:02:19,656 --> 01:02:20,696
<b>That's right.</b>

701
01:02:21,156 --> 01:02:22,857

<b>Be strong!</b>

800
01:11:07,587 --> 01:11:10,856
