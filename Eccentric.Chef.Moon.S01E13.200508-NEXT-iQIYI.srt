00:00:11,756 --> 00:00:14,497
<b>[ Episode 13 ]</b>

2
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:20,765
<b>- What's this about?
- Sir.</b>

3
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:25,035
<b>The police are going to reinvestigate
the fire at Pungcheonok in Seoul.</b>

4
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:26,675
<b>What should I do?</b>

5
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:29,475
<b>What about that?</b>

6
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,375
<b>Will that be a problem for us?</b>

7
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:36,785
<b>No, it won't.
But I looked into this a little deeper.</b>

8
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:40,455
<b>And I found out this reinvestigation was
launched by Nonyang Police Station.</b>

9
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:42,825
<b>Nonyang?</b>

10
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:45,555
<b>Isn't that where Seoha Village is?</b>

11
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:47,265
<b>Yes.</b>

12
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:07,315
<b>Go home.</b>

13
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:57,865
<b>[ It turns out, ]</b>

14
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,965
<b>[ my father and Yoo Hyo-myoung ]</b>

15
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:03,535
<b>[ didn't die in an accident 20 years ago. ]</b>

16
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:06,135
<b>Then what is it?</b>

17
00:02:06,579 --> 00:02:09,204
<b>Chul-yong planned the murders
and made them look like an accident.</b>

18
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:13,145
<b>[ My mom just told me about everything. ]</b>

19
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:14,885
<b>What?</b>

20
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:19,385
<b>So, he killed...</b>

21
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:44,415
<b>[ If I pushed forward with the construction
of the clothing industrial complex, ]</b>

22
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:46,515
<b>I would have regretted it.</b>

23
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:51,055
<b>I would have missed my chance
of witnessing such a great restaurant.</b>

24
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,055
<b>What brings you here?</b>

25
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:57,855
<b>It is my duty as a businessman
to visit the talented chef</b>

26
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,995
<b>[ who runs a good restaurant in person. ]</b>

27
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:07,105
<b>When I withdrew the plan to develop
the clothing industrial complex,</b>

28
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,839
<b>I thought I may have unintentionally
harmed the village,</b>

29
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,705
<b>so I was sorry about it.</b>

30
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:15,475
<b>And I wanted to make a good business offer</b>

31
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:18,845
<b>to you while paying the village a visit.
So here I am.</b>

32
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,095
<b>From what I've heard,</b>

33
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,265
<b>your gukbap is to die for.</b>

34
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:36,795
<b>I know it's late,</b>

35
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,865
<b>but could I try some before I go?</b>

36
00:03:44,179 --> 00:03:45,535
<b>Please leave.</b>

37
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:47,675
<b>Gosh, I'm so disappointed.</b>

38
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:53,285
<b>I know it is very late to ask for food,
but I'm a customer, too.</b>

39
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:54,985
<b>Get out</b>

40
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,585
<b>right now.</b>

41
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:07,425
<b>Why?</b>

42
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:10,465
<b>Are you hiding something?</b>

43
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,235
<b>Don't you have more things
to hide than me?</b>

44
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:02,445
<b>That was Lim Chul-yong, wasn't it?</b>

45
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,785
<b>Do you think he figured out that I'm here?</b>

46
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:07,155
<b>What's wrong, Yu-jin?</b>

47
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:13,895
<b>Were you going to leave Korea
because of Lim Chul-yong?</b>

48
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:17,495
<b>Chef Moon.</b>

49
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:23,165
<b>What if people in our village get
in trouble because of me again?</b>

50
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:27,175
<b>Don't worry. That won't happen.</b>

51
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:31,145
<b>I should get my ducks in a row too.</b>

52
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:33,245
<b>What's your plan?</b>

53
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,685
<b>- Tell me about your plan too.
[ - Yu-jin. ]</b>

54
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,755
<b>I'll take care of this.</b>

55
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:40,985
<b>I'm just worried that
something might happen to you.</b>

56
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:44,555
<b>I don't want you or the village</b>

57
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:47,895
<b>to be in danger.</b>

58
00:05:58,509 --> 00:05:59,905
<b>It's not a bad feeling.</b>

59
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:02,705
<b>Having someone worry about you.</b>

60
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:08,385
<b>- Aren't you hungry?
- What?</b>

61
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,455
<b>No, I'm okay.</b>

62
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,455
<b>You really changed.</b>

63
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:17,055
<b>You used to make a fuss
because you were hungry at this hour.</b>

64
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:19,925
<b>Come on.</b>

65
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:22,025
<b>Wait.</b>

66
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,685
<b>It's ready. Try it.</b>

67
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,165
<b>What's this?</b>

68
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,665
<b>Magical porridge
that gets rid of your anxiety.</b>

69
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:08,505
<b>Gosh, there's no such thing.</b>

70
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:36,095
<b>Wasn't I right?</b>

71
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:04,255
<b>Yes, Chef Moon.</b>

72
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,025
<b>Chairman Lim Chul-yong
just paid me a visit.</b>

73
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:08,499
<b>What?</b>

74
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,025
<b>I have a bad feeling about this.</b>

75
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:17,705
<b>I'll go with you
when you meet up with Mr. Jin.</b>

76
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,125
<b>So you'll continue
to cause trouble to the end?</b>

77
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:06,455
<b>Mom.</b>

78
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:10,895
<b>I kept my promise</b>

79
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:12,825
<b>to keep you safe.</b>

80
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:15,995
<b>So give me a compliment.</b>

81
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:20,065
<b>But</b>

82
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:23,605
<b>I'm going to stop making clothes.</b>

83
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,305
<b>I'm just exhausted.</b>

84
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:31,945
<b>But I hope you won't scold me for that.</b>

85
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:36,045
<b>I was still able to fulfill the dream</b>

86
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:39,415
<b>you couldn't.</b>

87
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:43,125
<b>Tell me that I can stop now</b>

88
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:45,955
<b>and I did a good job</b>

89
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:50,265
<b>if you can hear me now.</b>

90
00:10:57,210 --> 00:10:58,675
<b>And</b>

91
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:03,345
<b>I'm not sure if I could stay here.</b>

92
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:07,445
<b>I want to stay with him.</b>

93
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:11,285
<b>Staying here in this village</b>

94
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:16,725
<b>and living a happy life
with the people here would be nice.</b>

95
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,265
<b>But I keep making things hard for them.</b>

96
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:27,505
<b>Please tell me</b>

97

<b>[ Byeol-na! ]</b>

<b>My goodness. Are you all right?</b>

103
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:05,335
<b>Where have you been? Goodness.</b>

104
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:07,405
<b>I was visiting my mom's grave.</b>

<b>- What?
- What?</b>

<b>- Her mom's grave.

<b>But what are you doing this morning?</b>

108

<b>- What?

<b>What are you hiding?</b>

110
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:21,829
<b>- Well...
- We were just...</b>

111

<b>We were exercising.</b>

<b>- My gosh, my body aches now.
- Right.</b>

117
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,369
<b>You should have washed your face first.</b>

<b>What?</b>

119

<b>- I see.
[ - Right. ]</b>

120

<b>[ You can tell that we didn't, right?

<b>Dad, wake up.</b>

122

<b>Dad! Wake up.</b>

<b>Seol-a, what's wrong?</b>

<b>- What?
[ - What? ]</b>

<b>I looked everywhere, but she's not here.</b>

<b>Ms. Pi!</b>

<b>Hey, Da-hoon.</b>

<b>What are you talking about?
Byeol-na is gone?</b>

130
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:11,505
<b>My gosh. Okay.</b>

131
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:14,775
<b>Okay. I got it. I'm on my way.</b>

<b>Honey, wake up. Byeol-na is gone again.</b>

<b>What? The police?</b>

139

<b>Yes. We must call them.</b>

140

<b>Didn't I say it was nothing?</b>

141

<b>What?</b>

142

<b>Be quiet.</b>

<b>He's a terrible man.</b>

<b>I don't know.</b>
