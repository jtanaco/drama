1
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:07,696
<b>- Mom.
- You idiot.</b>

2
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:09,966
<b>Mom, talk it out.
Don't resort to violence.</b>

3
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:12,006
<b>That could become a habit!</b>

4
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:13,800
<b>- How dare you?
- Mom.</b>

5
00:00:17,029 --> 00:00:18,800
<b>- What?
- What?</b>

6
00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:20,539
<b>- You...
- What?</b>

7
00:00:20,599 --> 00:00:21,670
<b>You...</b>

8
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:24,140
<b>- Mom, we're here.
- Mother, we're...</b>

9
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:27,039
<b>What?</b>

10
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:30,379
<b>Da Hee. Why are you here?</b>

11
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:31,879
<b>Na Hee.</b>

12
00:00:38,189 --> 00:00:40,960
<b>Why are you here
and what's with the apron?</b>

13
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:44,335
<b>Na Hee, I was going to tell you...</b>

14
00:00:44,359 --> 00:00:45,500
<b>Your sister...</b>

15
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:48,375
<b>is working part-time here
in the evenings.</b>

16
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:50,146
<b>- Sorry?
- I needed extra help...</b>

17
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:51,405
<b>and she was looking for a job.</b>

18
00:00:51,429 --> 00:00:53,275
<b>Isn't it nice that
we can help each other?</b>

19
00:00:53,299 --> 00:00:54,445
<b>I get to have a reliable employee...</b>

20
00:00:54,469 --> 00:00:56,415
<b>while your sister
has a safe place to work.</b>

21
00:00:56,439 --> 00:00:57,509
<b>Hold on a second.</b>

22
00:00:57,939 --> 00:01:00,116
<b>So she's my in-law?</b>

23
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:03,380
<b>Na Hee's real biological sister?</b>

24
00:01:03,549 --> 00:01:05,780
<b>Would she be a fake sister then?</b>

25
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:08,250
<b>You met her at the wedding.</b>

26
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:18,930
<b>We should talk.</b>

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,099
<b>But...</b>

28
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:23,530
<b>Da Hee...</b>

29
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,239
<b>Right!</b>

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,109
<b>Now I remember.</b>

31
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:35,525
<b>You will quit this instant.</b>

32
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:36,555
<b>What?</b>

33
00:01:36,579 --> 00:01:39,055
<b>Quit working at this cafe.</b>

34
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:41,590
<b>- Why?
- Must you ask?</b>

35
00:01:41,689 --> 00:01:43,566
<b>There are other places to work.</b>

36
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:45,335
<b>You can keep searching for a job,</b>

37
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:46,590
<b>so why here of all places?</b>

38
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:49,706
<b>Don't you see
how uncomfortable this is for me?</b>

39
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:51,260
<b>I'll make sure
it doesn't get to that.</b>

40
00:01:51,459 --> 00:01:53,635
<b>I know what you're worried about,</b>

41
00:01:53,659 --> 00:01:56,706
<b>but I'm going to work hard
and always stay on her good side.</b>

42
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:59,616
<b>Na Hee, please.
It's close to home and my academy...</b>

43
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,340
<b>and the hourly rate
is higher than in other places.</b>

44
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:04,209
<b>Mom already approved.</b>

45
00:02:05,109 --> 00:02:06,616
<b>Mom approved?</b>

46
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,756
<b>So please
just let it slide this once.</b>

47
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:11,286
<b>I'll do a good job.</b>

48
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:13,325
<b>You working hard isn't the issue.</b>

49
00:02:13,349 --> 00:02:16,289
<b>I just hate the fact
that you're working here.</b>

50
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:18,120
<b>Things are already...</b>

51
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,830
<b>Just quit, okay?</b>

52
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:27,536
<b>I'll pay for your classes
if you need the money,</b>

53
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,500
<b>so focus solely
on your studies instead.</b>

54
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:35,770
<b>You're really good at
kicking me down.</b>

55
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:41,515
<b>Don't you understand why I'm
going back to college at this age...</b>

56
00:02:41,539 --> 00:02:43,339
<b>and working a part-time job
to support myself?</b>

57
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,719
<b>It's because I want to succeed
without your help or dad's.</b>

58
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:49,289
<b>I don't want to be a shameless brat.</b>

59
00:02:50,349 --> 00:02:53,460
<b>So just let me work this job, okay?</b>

60
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:54,919
<b>Please.</b>

61
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:57,389
<b>Da Hee, but still...</b>

62
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:09,316
<b>Can you stop glaring at me?</b>

63
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:11,216
<b>Your eyes look like
they're going to pop out.</b>

64
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,710
<b>He's right, Mom.</b>

65
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:15,256
<b>Let your anger subside now...</b>

66
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,110
<b>and stop glaring at him like that.</b>

67
00:03:18,449 --> 00:03:22,096
<b>Getting all worked up will only
elevate your blood pressure.</b>

68
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,325
<b>It's dangerous considering your age.</b>

69
00:03:24,349 --> 00:03:26,120
<b>How sweet of you to think of me.</b>

70
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,159
<b>How considerate!</b>

71
00:03:29,729 --> 00:03:31,306
<b>So why have you been
hiding from me...</b>

72
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:32,930
<b>after returning to Korea?</b>

73
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:35,346
<b>You're his big brother,</b>

74
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:37,346
<b>but instead of telling him off,</b>

75
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:39,346
<b>you joined him on his lie
and deceived your mom.</b>

76
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:43,310
<b>Mom, please. This wasn't deception.
You're taking it too far.</b>

77
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,816
<b>He's right. You're overreacting.</b>

78
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,786
<b>I wasn't going
to lie to you forever.</b>

79
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:50,526
<b>I was going to surprise you
with my presence...</b>

80
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:52,680
<b>after enjoying some freedom.</b>

81
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:55,889
<b>Surprise me? My foot!</b>

82
00:03:56,689 --> 00:03:57,889
<b>You jerks.</b>

83
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:01,830
<b>Is this what I get
for worrying about my sons?</b>

84
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:05,460
<b>My blood pressure is rising.</b>

85
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,406
<b>Na Hee, you're just as bad.</b>

86
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:10,406
<b>These two have always been clueless,</b>

87
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:12,645
<b>but I didn't think
you'd deceive me too.</b>

88
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:15,216
<b>Shouldn't you of all people
have told me about him?</b>

89
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,786
<b>Mom, why are you
taking it out on her?</b>

90
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:18,246
<b>Na Hee didn't do anything wrong.</b>

91
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:21,209
<b>Mother, I apologize
for not telling you.</b>

92
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:25,250
<b>But I think my sister
should find another job.</b>

93
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:28,990
<b>It'll be hard for her
to work for an in-law...</b>

94
00:04:29,189 --> 00:04:31,466
<b>and your relationship with my mom...</b>

95
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:33,330
<b>- will make things uncomfortable.
- It doesn't.</b>

96
00:04:34,019 --> 00:04:36,189
<b>I'm fine. It's not uncomfortable.</b>

97
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:37,267
<b>Sorry?</b>

98
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:39,476
<b>Your sister has been doing
a great job...</b>

99
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,660
<b>and she's nice to the customers,</b>

100
00:04:41,829 --> 00:04:44,230
<b>unlike her own sister.</b>

101
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:45,745
<b>Your mother already approved too,</b>

102
00:04:45,769 --> 00:04:47,875
<b>so there's nothing more
to talk about.</b>

103
00:04:47,899 --> 00:04:49,485
<b>Not telling me about Jae Seok
is one thing,</b>

104
00:04:49,509 --> 00:04:51,245
<b>but why don't you ever
pick up my calls?</b>

105
00:04:51,269 --> 00:04:53,055
<b>Are you busy
every second of the time?</b>

106
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:54,115
<b>You're not the only doctor
in this family.</b>

107
00:04:54,139 --> 00:04:56,685
<b>Both of my sons are doctors too!</b>

108
00:04:56,709 --> 00:04:58,286
<b>You always boast about...</b>

109
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:59,795
<b>graduating at the top
of your class,</b>

110
00:04:59,819 --> 00:05:01,696
<b>but Jae Seok
received top grades once.</b>

111
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,125
<b>- Aren't I right?
- You are.</b>

112
00:05:03,149 --> 00:05:04,126
<b>- Right?
- Yes.</b>

113
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:08,836
<b>I raised my sons as doctors
without any hitches either,</b>

114
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:10,959
<b>so why do you keep ignoring me?</b>

115
00:05:11,329 --> 00:05:12,605
<b>Are you not going to stop this?</b>

116
00:05:12,629 --> 00:05:13,660
<b>Stop what?</b>

117
00:05:13,899 --> 00:05:15,600
<b>I'm talking about Da Hee.</b>

118
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:18,745
<b>Things with us
are complicated enough.</b>

119
00:05:18,769 --> 00:05:22,516
<b>I don't get why your mother
insisted on hiring Da Hee anyway.</b>

120
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:24,485
<b>It doesn't make any sense!</b>

121
00:05:24,509 --> 00:05:26,540
<b>Since when did you try
to understand my mom anyway?</b>

122
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:28,355
<b>It's nothing new.</b>

123
00:05:28,379 --> 00:05:30,286
<b>I'm not looking for an argument.</b>

124
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:32,396
<b>We're divorced
but our parents don't know.</b>

125
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:33,425
<b>Doesn't it bother you?</b>

126
00:05:33,449 --> 00:05:34,620
<b>Whatever.</b>

127
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:37,495
<b>If you're that bothered,
talk to my mom yourself.</b>

128
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:38,896
<b>She's someone I can't persuade.</b>

129
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,065
<b>Are you kidding me?</b>

130
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:43,160
<b>I'm not kidding you,
but what else can I say, right?</b>

131
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:44,759
<b>You're being childish.</b>

132
00:05:44,889 --> 00:05:46,836
<b>Right, I'm childish...</b>

133
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:49,146
<b>- and you're selfish.
- What?</b>

134
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:51,946
<b>Our divorce is our problem, right?</b>

135
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:54,839
<b>Just like you said,
our families don't know.</b>

136
00:05:55,069 --> 00:05:57,269
<b>You can't tell Da Hee
she can't work there...</b>

137
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:58,786
<b>just because
it makes you uncomfortable.</b>

138
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:01,755
<b>That's extremely selfish.
Da Hee did nothing wrong.</b>

139
00:06:01,779 --> 00:06:04,326
<b>Of course, you're considerate
at times like this.</b>

140
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:05,956
<b>We're never on the same page.</b>

141
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:08,490
<b>Yes, exactly.
No wonder we got divorced.</b>

142
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,319
<b>Yes, I guess you're right.</b>

143
00:06:13,189 --> 00:06:15,096
<b>Me being uncomfortable is my issue,</b>

144
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,860
<b>so I'll deal with that myself.</b>

145
00:06:17,129 --> 00:06:20,435
<b>But your mom is your issue,
so you should deal with her.</b>

146
00:06:20,459 --> 00:06:23,399
<b>Okay, got it.
What about your mother though?</b>

147
00:06:23,769 --> 00:06:27,339
<b>Don't you think you'll ask me
for any favors with her?</b>

148
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:30,470
<b>I can deal with my mom just fine.</b>

149
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:34,240
<b>She just thinks
she's above everyone.</b>

150
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,949
<b>The truth is,</b>

151
00:06:44,589 --> 00:06:48,660
<b>my marriage was voided
on the day of the wedding.</b>

152
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:53,100
<b>I won't say why
because that's privacy.</b>

153
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,129
<b>But then today, I even lost my job.</b>

154
00:06:58,899 --> 00:07:01,769
<b>Don't you think that
life is just crazy?</b>

155
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:08,949
<b>What on earth did I say
to my in-law?</b>

156
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:10,910
<b>How stupid of me.</b>

157
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:14,026
<b>Why didn't I remember him?</b>

158
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:16,326
<b>I greeted him at Na Hee's wedding.</b>

159
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:18,389
<b>Gosh, this is embarrassing!</b>

160
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:21,435
<b>I blame my useless brain.</b>

161
00:07:21,459 --> 00:07:23,605
<b>Why bother
bringing it around with you?</b>

162
00:07:23,629 --> 00:07:25,730
<b>Why? Why?</b>

163
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,129
<b>She was Na Hee's sister?</b>

164
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,646
<b>No wonder she seemed familiar.</b>

165
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:36,985
<b>Could I be losing my touch?</b>

166
00:07:37,009 --> 00:07:39,709
<b>I never forget a girl's face.</b>

167
00:07:39,939 --> 00:07:43,850
<b>Anyway, what a fun connection.
I'm entertained.</b>

168
00:07:44,649 --> 00:07:45,750
<b>My gosh!</b>

169
00:07:46,379 --> 00:07:49,920
<b>Mom, at least knock.
Where are your manners?</b>

170
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:52,660
<b>Manners, my foot.
You're unbelievable.</b>

171
00:07:52,689 --> 00:07:55,096
<b>Who are you to speak about manners?</b>

172
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,589
<b>You imbecile.</b>

173
00:07:57,829 --> 00:07:59,005
<b>What do you want to eat?</b>

174
00:07:59,029 --> 00:08:00,875
<b>We can argue some more later,</b>

175
00:08:00,899 --> 00:08:02,505
<b>but you should
have some dinner first.</b>

176
00:08:02,529 --> 00:08:05,740
<b>It's all right, Mom. I'm not hungry.</b>

177
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:06,947
<b>I'm good.</b>

178
00:08:06,971 --> 00:08:09,670
<b>As if you are, you jerk.</b>

179
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,639
<b>Take your pick already.
Steak or salmon?</b>

180
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:18,009
<b>If I had known,
I would've gone grocery shopping.</b>

181
00:08:19,149 --> 00:08:20,795
<b>You brat.</b>

182
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:23,625
<b>I can't believe you're making me
cook on the fly like this.</b>

183
00:08:23,649 --> 00:08:25,096
<b>Mom, I'm really good.</b>

184
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,036
<b>I had a sandwich earlier,
so I'm not hungry.</b>

185
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:29,836
<b>Shut it. As if a sandwich
can keep you full.</b>

186
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:32,459
<b>Anyway, get changed.
I'll whip something up.</b>

187
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:36,675
<b>I'll now be cooking for
my grown-up son at this age.</b>

188
00:08:36,699 --> 00:08:39,200
<b>What a hard time I'll have.</b>

189
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:46,039
<b>My goodness. Unbelievable.</b>

190
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,679
<b>I have a bad feeling about this.</b>

191
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:59,090
<b>Looking good.</b>

192
00:08:59,659 --> 00:09:02,330
<b>Where's the frying pan?</b>

193
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:05,960
<b>I put it all the way up there
since I never use it.</b>

194
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:10,500
<b>Jae Seok, can you get over here?
I need your help.</b>

195
00:09:10,529 --> 00:09:11,669
<b>Jae Seok?</b>

196
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:13,470
<b>Please get that frying pan for me.</b>

197
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,216
<b>All right. So the meat is out...</b>

198
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,785
<b>and now for the balsamic sauce.</b>

199
00:09:23,809 --> 00:09:27,750
<b>I'm glad I had it restocked.</b>

200
00:09:29,019 --> 00:09:30,649
<b>My gosh.</b>

201
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:34,265
<b>Jae Seok, please open this for me!</b>

202
00:09:34,289 --> 00:09:35,429
<b>My goodness.</b>

203
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:38,700
<b>Please open this for me.</b>

204
00:09:40,929 --> 00:09:41,929
<b>Thank you.</b>

205
00:09:42,629 --> 00:09:43,669
<b>Jae Seok?</b>

206
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,639
<b>It's nothing.</b>

207
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:54,316
<b>My gosh.</b>

208
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:57,980
<b>Jae Seok. Jae Seok,
pass me the paper towel.</b>

209
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,580
<b>Gosh, thanks.</b>

210
00:10:04,789 --> 00:10:06,690
<b>Jae Seok?</b>

211
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:09,836
<b>Jae Seok!</b>

212
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:13,259
<b>- No, I hear nothing.
- Jae Seok!</b>

213
00:10:16,429 --> 00:10:20,245
<b>Why didn't you answer me?
I've been calling you.</b>

214
00:10:20,269 --> 00:10:22,416
<b>Yes, Mother. You called?</b>

215
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,615
<b>Can you open the wine bottle for me?</b>

216
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:27,779
<b>I should've poured the wine
in a decanter sooner.</b>

217
00:10:32,149 --> 00:10:34,326
<b>I'm already regretting
moving back in.</b>

218
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:36,250
<b>What on earth do I do?</b>

219
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:38,860
<b>It's like I'm cooking
the meal myself.</b>

220
00:10:41,019 --> 00:10:43,336
<b>He should be home by now.</b>

221
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,529
<b>I wonder how much he drank.</b>

222
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,470
<b>(Not on my side)</b>

223
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,716
<b>The person you called
is unavailable.</b>

224
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:57,139
<b>Why isn't he answering his phone?</b>

225
00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:04,980
<b>Yes, Mr. Yang.</b>

226
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:07,649
<b>Are you perhaps with my husband?</b>

227
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,090
<b>You parted ways?</b>

228
00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:15,889
<b>I guess he'll be home soon then.
Sure. Goodnight.</b>

229
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:29,409
<b>- My gosh. Honey!
- Hello?</b>

230
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:32,779
<b>My wife!</b>

231
00:11:33,009 --> 00:11:34,515
<b>You'll fall. Be careful.</b>

232
00:11:34,539 --> 00:11:36,726
<b>Why did you drink so much today?</b>

233
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:40,649
<b>Yes, I drank today. I drank a lot.</b>

234
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,426
<b>Ok Boon!</b>

235
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:44,620
<b>My gosh.</b>

236
00:11:45,289 --> 00:11:47,566
<b>You saying that shows me...</b>

237
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:48,936
<b>just how drunk you are.</b>

238
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:52,129
<b>Ok Boon,
there's no need to be angry.</b>

239
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:54,535
<b>How scary.</b>

240
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:55,629
<b>Goodness.</b>

241
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:57,970
<b>Unbelievable.</b>

242
00:12:00,669 --> 00:12:01,769
<b>How was it?</b>

243
00:12:02,269 --> 00:12:04,840
<b>It went really well.</b>

244
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:08,779
<b>I don't get why you always insist on
going there yourself.</b>

245
00:12:09,049 --> 00:12:11,086
<b>Let me join you next year.</b>

246
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:14,255
<b>I may not have met my sister-in-law,
but I should at least say hello.</b>

247
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:16,395
<b>What if she thinks
that you married...</b>

248
00:12:16,419 --> 00:12:18,596
<b>some selfish woman?</b>

249
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:21,590
<b>What? No way!</b>

250
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:25,429
<b>My Young Suk is the sweetest ever,
so she'd never think that way.</b>

251
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:29,830
<b>It's why she put her trust in me
and went to a dangerous place.</b>

252
00:12:31,169 --> 00:12:32,846
<b>Honey, please.</b>

253
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:34,000
<b>Ok Boon,</b>

254
00:12:34,899 --> 00:12:38,110
<b>I'm a little sad today.</b>

255
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,480
<b>Life couldn't be sadder.</b>

256
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:50,320
<b>Why have you aged so much though?</b>

257
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:55,365
<b>Who did this?
Who made my wife age like this?</b>

258
00:12:55,389 --> 00:12:58,505
<b>Who else could it be but you?</b>

259
00:12:58,529 --> 00:12:59,559
<b>Get out here!</b>

260
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,446
<b>- Who was it?
- Honey, be quiet!</b>

261
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:05,500
<b>Just wait until I catch you.</b>

262
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:07,346
<b>Whoever it was, show yourself!</b>

263
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:09,316
<b>- Honey, keep it down.
- Get out here!</b>

264
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:11,546
<b>Dad. Why did he drink so much?</b>

265
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:12,956
<b>He had a few drinks with Mr. Yang.</b>

266
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:14,716
<b>- Hurry up and take him.
- Of course.</b>

267
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,110
<b>Dad, are you all right?</b>

268
00:13:18,309 --> 00:13:21,556
<b>Loafer 1 and Loafer 2.</b>

269
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:23,250
<b>I see you're fine.</b>

270
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,919
<b>Son, life is hard, isn't it?</b>

271
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:29,605
<b>How about I give you an allowance?</b>

272
00:13:29,629 --> 00:13:31,235
<b>Dad, it's okay.</b>

273
00:13:31,259 --> 00:13:33,436
<b>You'll only take it back
tomorrow anyway.</b>

274
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:36,946
<b>Don't be like that. I'm not kidding.</b>

275
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:39,645
<b>I promise I won't take it back.</b>

276
00:13:39,669 --> 00:13:41,000
<b>Gosh.</b>

277
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,639
<b>Hold on. How much should I give you?</b>

278
00:13:44,539 --> 00:13:47,580
<b>Here you go.</b>

279
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:50,009
<b>Wait a second.</b>

280
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:52,426
<b>There you go.</b>

281
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:54,355
<b>Wait, 100 dollars each?</b>

282
00:13:54,379 --> 00:13:55,625
<b>Is this for real?</b>

283
00:13:55,649 --> 00:13:58,049
<b>Why? Isn't it enough?
Do you want more?</b>

284
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:00,190
<b>Hold on a second then.</b>

285
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,735
<b>Here. Take as much as you need!</b>

286
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:05,066
<b>- Dad, it's all right.
- Take it all.</b>

287
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:06,235
<b>It's fine.</b>

288
00:14:06,259 --> 00:14:07,306
<b>Honestly, it's fine.</b>

289
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:09,676
<b>Dad, isn't this a bit too much?</b>

290
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,600
<b>You're closing up the bar?</b>

291
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:13,039
<b>- Really?
- Really?</b>

292
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:16,139
<b>Of course.
I wouldn't joke about this.</b>

293
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:19,056
<b>- But this is too sudden.
- Are you getting married?</b>

294
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:22,625
<b>My gosh. I wouldn't mind
you setting me up with someone.</b>

295
00:14:22,649 --> 00:14:25,696
<b>It's just too sudden, that's all.</b>

296
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,226
<b>Are you ill then?</b>

297
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:30,096
<b>I'm just sick and tired
of running a bar.</b>

298
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:33,166
<b>Dealing with drunk jerks
is annoying enough.</b>

299
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:36,629
<b>And the smell of alcohol
is sickening.</b>

300
00:14:36,659 --> 00:14:40,429
<b>Trying to sound cute all the time
is exhausting too.</b>

301
00:14:41,059 --> 00:14:43,846
<b>I'm thinking about
moving on to another business.</b>

302
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:45,029
<b>Something more ordinary.</b>

303
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:46,416
<b>What about us then?</b>

304
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:49,509
<b>You two?
You should go about your own ways.</b>

305
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:51,885
<b>Don't you worry though.</b>

306
00:14:51,909 --> 00:14:54,509
<b>I'll give you a good reference
if you need one...</b>

307
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:56,250
<b>and pay up a fat pension...</b>

308
00:14:56,509 --> 00:14:58,950
<b>if you wish to retire
and head back home.</b>

309
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,450
<b>No way.</b>

310
00:15:01,149 --> 00:15:02,326
<b>I'd rather stick with you.</b>

311
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:03,990
<b>But you don't know
what I'll end up doing.</b>

312
00:15:04,289 --> 00:15:05,549
<b>Just go on your way.</b>

313
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:07,995
<b>I will pay your money back
once I get the security deposit.</b>

314
00:15:08,019 --> 00:15:10,429
<b>I don't want to.
I'll come with you no matter what.</b>

315
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:12,830
<b>- So don't even try to send me away.
- Me too.</b>

316
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:15,105
<b>- What?
- I'm coming with you too.</b>

317
00:15:15,129 --> 00:15:16,769
<b>Wherever you go, I'll be there.</b>

318
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,299
<b>Don't be silly.</b>

319
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,546
<b>There's nothing you can get from me.</b>

320
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:25,385
<b>That's not true.</b>

321
00:15:25,409 --> 00:15:26,879
<b>You pay us, feed us,</b>

322
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:29,679
<b>and even care about us.
We get everything from you.</b>

323
00:15:29,879 --> 00:15:32,056
<b>So don't even think
about abandoning us.</b>

324
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:35,895
<b>I'll follow you
to the ends of the earth.</b>

325
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:38,350
<b>Gosh, you fools.</b>

326
00:15:38,889 --> 00:15:40,259
<b>Do as you like.</b>

327
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:42,735
<b>Just remember I gave you
a chance to get away.</b>

328
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:44,230
<b>Don't blame me later.</b>

329
00:15:44,389 --> 00:15:46,176
<b>So what are you going to do?</b>

330
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,605
<b>Will you open
a supermarket or something?</b>

331
00:15:47,629 --> 00:15:48,676
<b>No, kimbap.</b>

332
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,476
<b>- Kimbap?
- My goodness.</b>

333
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,700
<b>I want to run a kimbap restaurant.</b>

334
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:55,539
<b>If I run a restaurant,
I will never starve to death.</b>

335
00:15:56,269 --> 00:15:58,385
<b>And you guys said...</b>

336
00:15:58,409 --> 00:16:00,409
<b>I make the best kimbap.</b>

337
00:16:01,409 --> 00:16:03,586
<b>You said it is even better
than a franchise restaurant's.</b>

338
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:05,210
<b>Oh, right.</b>

339
00:16:05,879 --> 00:16:06,980
<b>Kimbap.</b>

340
00:16:07,649 --> 00:16:09,490
<b>Maybe I should make kimbap
with this corn.</b>

341
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:10,649
<b>It's corn kimbap.</b>

342
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:17,029
<b>What should we do?</b>

343
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:18,336
<b>Don't you think
we should be honest with her?</b>

344
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,836
<b>Her kimbap tastes terrible.</b>

345
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,135
<b>We can't say that to her.</b>

346
00:16:21,159 --> 00:16:22,775
<b>And it's you who said
her kimbap tastes terrible.</b>

347
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:25,245
<b>You... Gosh, I can't believe this.</b>

348
00:16:25,269 --> 00:16:26,970
<b>Why are things going this way?</b>

349
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,909
<b>Hey, make sure to hold out
to the end this time.</b>

350
00:16:37,149 --> 00:16:39,009
<b>Just worry about yourself.</b>

351
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,250
<b>He's coming.</b>

352
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:45,419
<b>- That feels good.
- Did you shower already?</b>

353
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:47,596
<b>Gosh, you're amazing.</b>

354
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:50,365
<b>Sure. He's even stronger
than a stuntman like me.</b>

355
00:16:50,389 --> 00:16:52,029
<b>- Bring it back.
- What?</b>

356
00:16:52,629 --> 00:16:54,176
<b>Bring what?</b>

357
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,600
<b>The one who brings it first
will get 30 dollars.</b>

358
00:16:57,799 --> 00:16:59,139
<b>- Here, Dad.
- Okay.</b>

359
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:00,669
<b>Gosh.</b>

360
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:03,169
<b>Hey, hand it over.</b>

361
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,539
<b>- Here.
- Okay.</b>

362
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:10,880
<b>What?</b>

363
00:17:11,779 --> 00:17:13,180
<b>Isn't there 100 dollars missing?</b>

364
00:17:14,049 --> 00:17:15,349
<b>Who is it? Hand it over.</b>

365
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,589
<b>- It's not me.
- It's not me either.</b>

366
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:20,065
<b>Do you want me to search you?</b>

367
00:17:20,089 --> 00:17:22,366
<b>Do you want me to search you
while you do handstands?</b>

368
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:23,666
<b>Seriously, it's not me.</b>

369
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:25,505
<b>I swear I didn't take it.</b>

370
00:17:25,529 --> 00:17:26,735
<b>I swear on Seo Jin.</b>

371
00:17:26,759 --> 00:17:28,676
<b>What are you guys doing
early in the morning?</b>

372
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,845
<b>Once you give them money,
it's a done deal.</b>

373
00:17:30,869 --> 00:17:32,206
<b>Just go have breakfast.</b>

374
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:33,775
<b>Hey, go wake Ji Hun up.</b>

375
00:17:33,799 --> 00:17:34,876
<b>And you should put the soup
on the table.</b>

376
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:35,946
<b>- Okay.
- Okay.</b>

377
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:37,745
<b>Hang on. Just wait.</b>

378
00:17:37,769 --> 00:17:39,380
<b>I'm sure 100 dollars is missing.</b>

379
00:17:40,009 --> 00:17:42,950
<b>I'm going to find out.</b>

380
00:18:06,869 --> 00:18:09,440
<b>If you want to eat,
go buy some instant rice.</b>

381
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:11,085
<b>I made the steamed egg,</b>

382
00:18:11,109 --> 00:18:13,509
<b>but your mom made this kimchi
and stir-fried anchovies.</b>

383
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:15,285
<b>Don't act like you care.</b>

384
00:18:15,309 --> 00:18:16,309
<b>Forget it.</b>

385
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:22,119
<b>Kimchi and stir-fried anchovies?</b>

386
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,849
<b>I just blew myself up.</b>

387
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:29,019
<b>Fine. Take it all.
I can eat only with the egg.</b>

388
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:36,599
<b>Darn it. What's wrong with this?</b>

389
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:38,869
<b>Is it broken?</b>

390
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,509
<b>Darn it! What's wrong?</b>

391
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:03,890
<b>Was she really top of her class
at medical school?</b>

392
00:19:04,529 --> 00:19:05,660
<b>Isn't she a fool?</b>

393
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:11,075
<b>Mom. I was going to call you.</b>

394
00:19:11,099 --> 00:19:12,406
<b>About Da Hee.</b>

395
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:14,575
<b>Will you let her work
at my mother-in-law's cafe?</b>

396
00:19:14,599 --> 00:19:17,240
<b>What can I do?
They already agreed on it.</b>

397
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:19,255
<b>But it's so uncomfortable.</b>

398
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:21,416
<b>You know what she's like.</b>

399
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,686
<b>Just leave her be.
She won't be working there for long.</b>

400
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:26,825
<b>By the way, we're buying
new chickens today,</b>

401
00:19:26,849 --> 00:19:28,325
<b>so I'm thinking about
making chicken soup.</b>

402
00:19:28,349 --> 00:19:30,196
<b>You should stop by
with Gyu Jin after work.</b>

403
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:33,436
<b>I can't. We're busy
preparing for a conference.</b>

404
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:36,466
<b>Are you? Then I'll bring it
to your house.</b>

405
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:37,765
<b>You can eat it after work.</b>

406
00:19:37,789 --> 00:19:41,176
<b>Gosh, no. I'll stop by.</b>

407
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,269
<b>Why? You said you're busy.</b>

408
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:46,476
<b>I should eat anyway.</b>

409
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,369
<b>You don't have to come.
I'll go there.</b>

410
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:50,985
<b>Will you? That's better for me.</b>

411
00:19:51,009 --> 00:19:54,339
<b>Then why don't you stop by the store
on your way here?</b>

412
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:57,255
<b>I should boil 10 chickens.
They are quite heavy.</b>

413
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:58,950
<b>I want to take them home
in your car.</b>

414
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:02,356
<b>Okay. I'll do that.
I'll see you later then.</b>

415
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:03,390
<b>Bye.</b>

416
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:07,920
<b>Why does it have to be now?</b>

417
00:20:08,589 --> 00:20:13,035
<b>I guaranteed him
that I could handle my mom.</b>

418
00:20:13,059 --> 00:20:14,400
<b>Darn it.</b>

419
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:18,930
<b>What should I tell him?</b>

420
00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:22,910
<b>Gyu Jin, I'm so tired.</b>

421
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:25,245
<b>I have bags under my eyes already.</b>

422
00:20:25,269 --> 00:20:26,740
<b>Look. Can you see them?</b>

423
00:20:27,339 --> 00:20:29,140
<b>I just can't live like this.</b>

424
00:20:29,309 --> 00:20:31,555
<b>She keeps calling me for no reason.
"Jae Seok".</b>

425
00:20:31,579 --> 00:20:35,325
<b>And then again the next moment,
"Jae Seok".</b>

426
00:20:35,349 --> 00:20:37,250
<b>I feel like I'm hearing things.</b>

427
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:41,136
<b>Stop overreacting.
It's not like this is anything new.</b>

428
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:44,130
<b>It's been a long time,
so I just can't get used to it.</b>

429
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:51,575
<b>Jae Seok, what time do you get off?</b>

430
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:52,799
<b>It's Mom again.</b>

431
00:20:55,539 --> 00:20:57,240
<b>She keeps messaging me. Look.</b>

432
00:20:58,210 --> 00:20:59,910
<b>"Are you having dinner at home?"</b>

433
00:21:00,809 --> 00:21:03,210
<b>"I have yellow corvina.
Do you want it steamed or grilled?"</b>

434
00:21:03,779 --> 00:21:06,349
<b>This is a nightmare.
What should I do?</b>

435
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,995
<b>Should I just go back to Turkey?</b>

436
00:21:09,019 --> 00:21:12,025
<b>Hey, getting used to Mom
would be easier...</b>

437
00:21:12,049 --> 00:21:14,559
<b>- than living abroad.
- Gyu Jin.</b>

438
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:18,706
<b>You're just saying that
because it's not your business.</b>

439
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:20,106
<b>Whose fault do you think this is?</b>

440
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:22,476
<b>This is all because I was covering
for you and Na Hee.</b>

441
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,606
<b>What should I do then?
Do you want me to come clean...</b>

442
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:27,345
<b>and move back in with Mom too?</b>

443
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:29,409
<b>- Can't you do that?
- Do you think that would work?</b>

444
00:21:29,809 --> 00:21:31,285
<b>What should I do then?</b>

445
00:21:31,309 --> 00:21:33,616
<b>Mom is even more tiring now.</b>

446
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,640
<b>Yes?</b>

447
00:21:35,509 --> 00:21:37,426
<b>Are you two having coffee together?</b>

448
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:40,349
<b>Not really.
I was just grumbling and whining.</b>

449
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:44,049
<b>I'll join you
and hear you grumble next time.</b>

450
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:46,265
<b>But right now,
we need to plan a strategy.</b>

451
00:21:46,289 --> 00:21:47,920
<b>A strategy?</b>

452
00:21:48,289 --> 00:21:50,505
<b>What more do you need to plan now?</b>

453
00:21:50,529 --> 00:21:53,130
<b>You're being so talkative.
Did you not hear her?</b>

454
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,460
<b>She wants you to leave.</b>

455
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,900
<b>- Get out.
- Don't be mean.</b>

456
00:21:58,170 --> 00:21:59,970
<b>I'm very sensitive now
because of Mom.</b>

457
00:22:00,769 --> 00:22:03,485
<b>Na Hee, don't call me even if you
have no one to eat with today.</b>

458
00:22:03,509 --> 00:22:05,240
<b>I'll be very cranky all day.</b>

459
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:08,140
<b>Move over.</b>

460
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:10,309
<b>Gosh.</b>

461
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:14,480
<b>All right. What's the matter?
Go ahead and say it.</b>

462
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:17,119
<b>Well...</b>

463
00:22:18,849 --> 00:22:19,960
<b>Today,</b>

464
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:23,166
<b>I think I should go home.</b>

465
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:24,230
<b>Home?</b>

466
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:28,505
<b>Whose home?</b>

467
00:22:28,529 --> 00:22:30,176
<b>You know what I mean.</b>

468
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,529
<b>My home. Mr. Song Young Dal's house.</b>

469
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,646
<b>Mom told us to come
and eat chicken soup.</b>

470
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:38,045
<b>If we don't go,
she will come to our place.</b>

471
00:22:38,069 --> 00:22:39,555
<b>So I told her we'd go there.</b>

472
00:22:39,579 --> 00:22:40,640
<b>I see.</b>

473
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:43,680
<b>You said you could handle things.</b>

474
00:22:44,009 --> 00:22:46,680
<b>She asked us to stop by at the store
and take the chickens.</b>

475
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:51,289
<b>Make sure to leave on time.</b>

476
00:22:52,319 --> 00:22:53,896
<b>Hey, make note of this.</b>

477
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,859
<b>You have to go to my mom once too.</b>

478
00:22:56,289 --> 00:22:58,829
<b>How shameless.</b>

479
00:23:00,029 --> 00:23:02,230
<b>How could she change her words
just like that?</b>

480
00:23:02,869 --> 00:23:03,869
<b>My gosh.</b>

481
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:05,900
<b>Goodness.</b>

482
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:10,039
<b>- What's going on?
- What should we do?</b>

483
00:23:11,109 --> 00:23:12,210
<b>My goodness.</b>

484
00:23:12,539 --> 00:23:13,710
<b>Get off me.</b>

485
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:15,616
<b>Where did they go?</b>

486
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,525
<b>- My goodness.
- They just ran away.</b>

487
00:23:17,549 --> 00:23:19,726
<b>I can't believe this is happening.</b>

488
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:20,825
<b>- What?
- I know.</b>

489
00:23:20,849 --> 00:23:23,866
<b>She and I chatted away
on the street just yesterday.</b>

490
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:25,196
<b>But they just ran away overnight?</b>

491
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:27,335
<b>What's the matter? What happened?</b>

492
00:23:27,359 --> 00:23:29,089
<b>They ran away with the lodge money.</b>

493
00:23:29,789 --> 00:23:31,436
<b>- My gosh.
- Hey.</b>

494
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:32,505
<b>What's wrong?</b>

495
00:23:32,529 --> 00:23:33,636
<b>- Wake up.
- Hurry.</b>

496
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:35,376
<b>- Please hurry.
- Call 911.</b>

497
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,470
<b>Really?</b>

498
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:38,869
<b>Did they run away
with all the lodge money?</b>

499
00:23:39,369 --> 00:23:41,075
<b>Yes.</b>

500
00:23:41,099 --> 00:23:42,676
<b>The lodge money and borrowed money.</b>

501
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:45,216
<b>They even borrowed 10,000 dollars
from the shoe store...</b>

502
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,386
<b>promising they'd pay
20 percent of interests.</b>

503
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:49,410
<b>The shoe store owner
turned deadly pale.</b>

504
00:23:50,009 --> 00:23:51,150
<b>Gosh, it's so scary.</b>

505
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:54,426
<b>A few days ago, she asked me for
money offering 20 percent interest,</b>

506
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:56,750
<b>but I turned it down saying
my savings had not matured.</b>

507
00:23:57,150 --> 00:23:59,295
<b>What if I gave her my money?</b>

508
00:23:59,319 --> 00:24:00,666
<b>I'm so lucky.</b>

509
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:02,835
<b>My goodness.
People are really scary.</b>

510
00:24:02,859 --> 00:24:05,390
<b>How could she do that
with such a nice face?</b>

511
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:10,045
<b>Everybody who opened a store there
has moved out within a year.</b>

512
00:24:10,069 --> 00:24:11,369
<b>Is it a bad site?</b>

513
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:13,269
<b>I guess you're right.</b>

514
00:24:13,839 --> 00:24:15,245
<b>Before the dumpling restaurant,</b>

515
00:24:15,269 --> 00:24:16,616
<b>there was a fire
in the rice soup restaurant.</b>

516
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,839
<b>Fire!</b>

517
00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:20,609
<b>Fire!</b>

518
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:24,180
<b>And the owner of the dollar store
died of a heart attack.</b>

519
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:26,950
<b>I guess the place is cursed
or something.</b>

520
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:29,626
<b>Hey, Ok Ja. There you go again.</b>

521
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:31,226
<b>Think about it.</b>

522
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:34,765
<b>Something keeps happening
in that place while others are fine.</b>

523
00:24:34,789 --> 00:24:36,589
<b>Don't say things like that.</b>

524
00:24:37,259 --> 00:24:40,876
<b>Try to think if the dumpling store
owner borrowed money from you.</b>

525
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,235
<b>You might regret it later.</b>

526
00:24:42,259 --> 00:24:45,446
<b>Gosh, I don't have any money
to lend others.</b>

527
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:46,976
<b>When you come home drunk,</b>

528
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,869
<b>I just pocket 50 or 100 dollars...</b>

529
00:24:50,569 --> 00:24:52,410
<b>I knew it.</b>

530
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:54,480
<b>It was you.</b>

531
00:24:55,210 --> 00:24:56,926
<b>- What?
- My 100 dollars.</b>

532
00:24:56,950 --> 00:24:58,585
<b>It's you who took the money.</b>

533
00:24:58,609 --> 00:25:00,055
<b>My gosh, what are you talking about?</b>

534
00:25:00,079 --> 00:25:03,196
<b>I didn't take your money.
I'm innocent.</b>

535
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:05,866
<b>Hang on.
Onions, I must pay for them.</b>

536
00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:08,065
<b>I have to go out. See you later.</b>

537
00:25:08,089 --> 00:25:11,759
<b>Hey, hey! Gosh, that woman...</b>

538
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:15,206
<b>They say the thief is always
right under your nose.</b>

539
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:17,369
<b>You're so weird.</b>

540
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:20,646
<b>You never waste a single cent,</b>

541
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:23,009
<b>so why do you hand out cash
when you're drunk?</b>

542
00:25:23,369 --> 00:25:27,156
<b>Shall I get you drunk
and make you give me an allowance?</b>

543
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:28,585
<b>Count the chickens.</b>

544
00:25:28,609 --> 00:25:31,009
<b>Count the small
and large ones separately.</b>

545
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:32,710
<b>Okay.</b>

546
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:37,420
<b>The landlady must be so frustrated.</b>

547
00:25:38,289 --> 00:25:40,619
<b>I don't believe this.</b>

548
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:44,789
<b>I knew something was up when she
missed the rent for three months.</b>

549
00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:48,029
<b>It's not like fraudsters
have a sign on their forehead.</b>

550
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:50,505
<b>And I'm not a psychic.</b>

551
00:25:50,529 --> 00:25:52,545
<b>Enough of that nonsense.</b>

552
00:25:52,569 --> 00:25:55,646
<b>I want my rent,
so find a tenant soon.</b>

553
00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:56,647
<b>Quickly.</b>

554
00:25:56,671 --> 00:25:59,686
<b>How about you offer to rent it
below the market rate?</b>

555
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:03,380
<b>You really know how to upset me.</b>

556
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:12,190
<b>Bite it off. Bite it off.</b>

557
00:26:12,819 --> 00:26:15,019
<b>That's enough. Bite it off!</b>

558
00:26:19,529 --> 00:26:21,599
<b>How dare you?</b>

559
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,045
<b>Can I have some broth?</b>

560
00:26:23,069 --> 00:26:24,099
<b>Hey.</b>

561
00:26:24,869 --> 00:26:27,200
<b>You can't just sip the broth
without taking a noodle.</b>

562
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,670
<b>Don't you...</b>

563
00:26:28,769 --> 00:26:30,140
<b>You ate more than half.</b>

564
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:53,406
<b>Jong Soo. We may have no money,</b>

565
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:54,700
<b>but let's keep our pride.</b>

566
00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:57,505
<b>I'm always hungry,
however much I eat.</b>

567
00:26:57,529 --> 00:26:58,670
<b>I couldn't stop myself.</b>

568
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:05,009
<b>I'll try not to eat any noodles.</b>

569
00:27:10,509 --> 00:27:12,609
<b>Jeong Bong! Jong Soo!</b>

570
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:15,549
<b>- Joon Seon!
- You're here.</b>

571
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:21,366
<b>Why are you eating cup noodles?
You should eat some rice.</b>

572
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:23,235
<b>No, Joon Seon.</b>

573
00:27:23,259 --> 00:27:25,606
<b>We ate earlier. This is a snack.</b>

574
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:26,630
<b>Right, Jong Soo?</b>

575
00:27:26,759 --> 00:27:27,775
<b>That's right.</b>

576
00:27:27,799 --> 00:27:29,900
<b>Do you want some broth?</b>

577
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,275
<b>Do you get some sleep?</b>

578
00:27:33,299 --> 00:27:36,985
<b>Honestly, Joon Seon.
The room is warm all day long,</b>

579
00:27:37,009 --> 00:27:38,640
<b>and there's unlimited hot water.</b>

580
00:27:38,769 --> 00:27:41,579
<b>It's a hundred times better than
Action Art's dorm.</b>

581
00:27:41,809 --> 00:27:43,480
<b>Don't you worry, Joon Seon.</b>

582
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:49,480
<b>No? You can't spare anything?</b>

583
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:53,019
<b>I understand. I just asked.</b>

584
00:27:53,789 --> 00:27:55,666
<b>I'm just fine,</b>

585
00:27:55,690 --> 00:27:57,859
<b>but the guys need a job.</b>

586
00:27:58,789 --> 00:28:01,529
<b>Hey, Sang Gi. Your office...</b>

587
00:28:01,829 --> 00:28:04,245
<b>Darn this stupid...</b>

588
00:28:04,269 --> 00:28:05,706
<b>No, not you.</b>

589
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:07,869
<b>How much did it cost
to open up your business?</b>

590
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:10,910
<b>With the rent
and equipment and everything.</b>

591
00:28:12,069 --> 00:28:13,140
<b>40,000 dollars?</b>

592
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:17,480
<b>That's a lot.
Your office isn't that big.</b>

593
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:20,896
<b>Where would I get 40,000 dollars?</b>

594
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,579
<b>I just have a plastic bag.</b>

595
00:28:23,519 --> 00:28:25,950
<b>Okay, thanks anyway. Bye.</b>

596
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:34,329
<b>Hello...</b>

597
00:28:35,059 --> 00:28:36,099
<b>there.</b>

598
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:40,616
<b>Hello, Ms. Song.</b>

599
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:44,210
<b>Hello. How are you, Mr. Yoon?</b>

600
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:45,839
<b>Where's the boss?</b>

601
00:28:46,170 --> 00:28:48,815
<b>She went upstairs to get changed.</b>

602
00:28:48,839 --> 00:28:50,180
<b>Oh, okay.</b>

603
00:28:57,519 --> 00:29:00,519
<b>So, were you
very surprised yesterday?</b>

604
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:06,206
<b>I was so surprised myself.
No wonder you looked familiar.</b>

605
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:08,376
<b>At the cart bar and the hotel...</b>

606
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,775
<b>Anyway.</b>

607
00:29:09,799 --> 00:29:12,329
<b>I had no idea it was you.</b>

608
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:18,769
<b>Pardon? What do you mean?
What cart bar?</b>

609
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:20,856
<b>You don't remember?</b>

610
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,616
<b>Two days ago at the beer joint.</b>

611
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,926
<b>You drank a whole pitcher,</b>

612
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:25,325
<b>and at the cart bar with me,</b>

613
00:29:25,349 --> 00:29:26,995
<b>you got drunk and vented at me.</b>

614
00:29:27,019 --> 00:29:30,426
<b>That's not true.
I didn't drink two days ago.</b>

615
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:32,095
<b>I think you're mistaken.</b>

616
00:29:32,119 --> 00:29:33,890
<b>Don't say that.</b>

617
00:29:34,259 --> 00:29:36,630
<b>However drunk you were,
you must remember me.</b>

618
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:40,275
<b>I'm the type that shows up
in your dreams once we meet.</b>

619
00:29:40,299 --> 00:29:42,859
<b>Hello? Ms. Song? Hello?</b>

620
00:29:43,569 --> 00:29:46,269
<b>I did all sorts of things
for you that evening.</b>

621
00:29:47,269 --> 00:29:49,416
<b>I imparted wisdom
that I'd accumulated...</b>

622
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,446
<b>and offered heartfelt encouragement.</b>

623
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:53,210
<b>I even offered monetary support!</b>

624
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:55,656
<b>That really wasn't me.</b>

625
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,856
<b>Did you confuse me with
someone else?</b>

626
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:00,255
<b>I have such a common face.</b>

627
00:30:00,279 --> 00:30:02,396
<b>And I'm so terribly shy.</b>

628
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:06,226
<b>I don't drink alone with a guy
I just happened to meet.</b>

629
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:08,366
<b>I didn't say it was just us.
I said we drank together.</b>

630
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:09,460
<b>What?</b>

631
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:15,106
<b>Whether there were
2 or 3 of us is not important.</b>

632
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:16,845
<b>Because it wasn't me.</b>

633
00:30:16,869 --> 00:30:18,569
<b>Oh... Right...</b>

634
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:21,369
<b>Jae Seok. What are you doing here?</b>

635
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,386
<b>Why not go home if you got off work?</b>

636
00:30:23,410 --> 00:30:27,085
<b>Oh, well, that was because
I knew you'd be here.</b>

637
00:30:27,109 --> 00:30:30,626
<b>That's great.
Let's go to the department store.</b>

638
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:33,896
<b>You need new bed linen
and your desk lamp is too old.</b>

639
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,896
<b>We can have dinner there too.</b>

640
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:38,065
<b>Well, I'm so tired.</b>

641
00:30:38,089 --> 00:30:40,265
<b>Can we go on the weekend, Mother?</b>

642
00:30:40,289 --> 00:30:42,166
<b>Just come with me now.</b>

643
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:44,366
<b>Let's shop when the idea came up.</b>

644
00:30:44,390 --> 00:30:48,106
<b>Let's go. Come with me.
Let's go now.</b>

645
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:49,829
<b>Mom. But I...</b>

646
00:30:50,529 --> 00:30:53,345
<b>Da Hee, clean up and close up.</b>

647
00:30:53,369 --> 00:30:55,039
<b>- See you tomorrow.
- Bye.</b>

648
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,440
<b>- Let's go.
- Mom, wait.</b>

649
00:30:57,470 --> 00:30:59,345
<b>We're leaving now.</b>

650
00:30:59,369 --> 00:31:01,515
<b>You, the cart bar.</b>

651
00:31:01,539 --> 00:31:02,980
<b>Mom, wait.</b>

652
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:08,226
<b>How can someone be
such a terrible liar?</b>

653
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:10,650
<b>She practically broadcast that
she's bluffing.</b>

654
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:14,720
<b>Will you hurry up?
Why is someone so young so slow?</b>

655
00:31:14,859 --> 00:31:15,960
<b>Mom.</b>

656
00:31:17,029 --> 00:31:19,136
<b>Can't we cut it short and go home?</b>

657
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:21,529
<b>Bed linen is all the same.</b>

658
00:31:22,759 --> 00:31:25,676
<b>No. You start and end
your day in your bed.</b>

659
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:27,269
<b>You can't buy just anything.</b>

660
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:31,240
<b>Those small details
determine your quality of life.</b>

661
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:35,985
<b>Let's hurry. There's no time.</b>

662
00:31:36,009 --> 00:31:37,849
<b>We're only halfway through.</b>

663
00:31:38,309 --> 00:31:39,349
<b>Come along.</b>

664
00:31:41,779 --> 00:31:44,589
<b>I'm a slave, not a son.</b>

665
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:45,890
<b>Mom.</b>

666
00:31:46,759 --> 00:31:48,065
<b>Welcome, Gyu Jin.</b>

667
00:31:48,089 --> 00:31:50,130
<b>- Mother! Mother.
- Gyu Jin.</b>

668
00:31:50,390 --> 00:31:53,476
<b>I didn't eat all day
just so I could eat your chicken.</b>

669
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:55,660
<b>Did you really? Good for you.</b>

670
00:31:56,259 --> 00:31:58,245
<b>Today's chickens are so fat.</b>

671
00:31:58,269 --> 00:32:00,369
<b>Have one each and recharge.</b>

672
00:32:01,769 --> 00:32:03,916
<b>Is it because you
deal with kids all day long?</b>

673
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:06,069
<b>You both look so haggard.</b>

674
00:32:06,309 --> 00:32:07,616
<b>Are the chickens inside?</b>

675
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,555
<b>Let's get them quick. I'm hungry.</b>

676
00:32:09,579 --> 00:32:11,186
<b>- Okay.
- Well...</b>

677
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:13,025
<b>- Wait, wait.
- What?</b>

678
00:32:13,049 --> 00:32:15,880
<b>Hey there. You know them, don't you?</b>

679
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:17,795
<b>My son-in-law, the pediatrician.</b>

680
00:32:17,819 --> 00:32:19,089
<b>Oh, hello.</b>

681
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:22,759
<b>Hello. Na Hee,
it's been a while since I saw you.</b>

682
00:32:23,089 --> 00:32:25,666
<b>The shoe seller is in the hospital.
Shouldn't we visit her?</b>

683
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:28,606
<b>Hey, Jin Ju,
don't you know my son-in-law?</b>

684
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:30,206
<b>My daughter and the pediatrician.</b>

685
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:32,245
<b>- Hello.
- Yes, hi.</b>

686
00:32:32,269 --> 00:32:34,775
<b>The great son-in-law
and clever daughter are here.</b>

687
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:38,039
<b>He's not that great.
There are so many doctors nowadays.</b>

688
00:32:38,170 --> 00:32:41,085
<b>Still, they say it's nice to have
a doctor and lawyer in the family.</b>

689
00:32:41,109 --> 00:32:43,085
<b>It's a great help when you're sick.</b>

690
00:32:43,109 --> 00:32:44,186
<b>Sure.</b>

691
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:45,686
<b>Let's go in. Dad's inside.</b>

692
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:46,995
<b>- Okay. Bye.
- Go on inside.</b>

693
00:32:47,019 --> 00:32:48,380
<b>- Bye.
- See you.</b>

694
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,759
<b>She's such a show-off.</b>

695
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:56,359
<b>You'd think that she's the doctor.</b>

696
00:32:56,390 --> 00:32:59,166
<b>Let her be. What else
does she have to brag about...</b>

697
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:00,759
<b>than that daughter and her husband?</b>

698
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:03,200
<b>But still,</b>

699
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:05,130
<b>I'm kind of jealous.</b>

700
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,369
<b>Just a bit.</b>

701
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,186
<b>Really? Your brother is home?</b>

702
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:13,009
<b>That's great.
Your mom must be pleased.</b>

703
00:33:13,069 --> 00:33:16,886
<b>Yes, she's very pleased.
She gets quite lonely.</b>

704
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:20,009
<b>She does.
She was like that even in school.</b>

705
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:25,049
<b>She was.
I'd never seen someone so fussy.</b>

706
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:29,220
<b>Was it when I was eight?
I still remember.</b>

707
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:32,936
<b>She had her hair
braided into two pigtails,</b>

708
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,676
<b>and a book of poems...</b>

709
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:37,275
<b>under her arm either for show
or to actually read.</b>

710
00:33:37,299 --> 00:33:39,805
<b>She walked around the neighborhood
like that just to show off.</b>

711
00:33:39,829 --> 00:33:41,839
<b>She was given this nickname...</b>

712
00:33:44,569 --> 00:33:45,609
<b>Oh, dear.</b>

713
00:33:46,539 --> 00:33:49,309
<b>What did I just say?
That she showed off?</b>

714
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:53,995
<b>My goodness. I take it back.
Gyu Jin, I take it back.</b>

715
00:33:54,019 --> 00:33:56,849
<b>I'll pretend I didn't hear anything.</b>

716
00:33:57,019 --> 00:33:58,319
<b>Please do.</b>

717
00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:02,466
<b>You're so considerate.
You're a good man.</b>

718
00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:03,529
<b>Thank you.</b>

719
00:34:08,829 --> 00:34:11,700
<b>I think a small bone
got stuck in my throat.</b>

720
00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:15,416
<b>You should be very careful
with chicken bones.</b>

721
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,445
<b>They're hard to get out
if they're stuck.</b>

722
00:34:17,469 --> 00:34:18,510
<b>Okay, Dad.</b>

723
00:34:22,039 --> 00:34:24,956
<b>Why isn't Joon Seon home?</b>

724
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:27,296
<b>He jumps out of bed
for boiled chicken.</b>

725
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:29,449
<b>He wouldn't miss this feast.</b>

726
00:34:45,869 --> 00:34:48,369
<b>Kid. Does it taste good?</b>

727
00:34:49,269 --> 00:34:52,110
<b>My Seo Jin loves that ice cream too.</b>

728
00:34:55,579 --> 00:34:57,909
<b>I miss Seo Jin and Seo Young.</b>

729
00:35:00,619 --> 00:35:02,579
<b>Don't you miss your dad?</b>

730
00:35:04,449 --> 00:35:06,489
<b>Mom!</b>

731
00:35:07,389 --> 00:35:09,489
<b>Yes? What's wrong?</b>

732
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:11,989
<b>That's my cue to leave.</b>

733
00:35:19,429 --> 00:35:22,170
<b>Na Hee, wait up!</b>

734
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,916
<b>I packed one more
for you to take home.</b>

735
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:27,416
<b>You can make porridge
with the leftovers.</b>

736
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,909
<b>It's fine, Mom.</b>

737
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:30,885
<b>Let me take that.
Thank you so much.</b>

738
00:35:30,909 --> 00:35:32,785
<b>It's still quite hot,
so let me carry it.</b>

739
00:35:32,809 --> 00:35:34,320
<b>Here you go.</b>

740
00:35:34,619 --> 00:35:35,920
<b>Mother, let me carry it instead.</b>

741
00:35:38,289 --> 00:35:39,320
<b>Na Hee.</b>

742
00:35:40,019 --> 00:35:41,695
<b>What's wrong?
Did you and Gyu Jin argue?</b>

743
00:35:41,719 --> 00:35:44,465
<b>- What do you mean?
- You know what I mean.</b>

744
00:35:44,489 --> 00:35:46,760
<b>You were practically
shooting lasers at him.</b>

745
00:35:47,199 --> 00:35:50,075
<b>What was the argument about?
Your temper was the issue, right?</b>

746
00:35:50,099 --> 00:35:51,269
<b>Of course not.</b>

747
00:35:51,829 --> 00:35:53,845
<b>I don't let my temper
flare up for no reason.</b>

748
00:35:53,869 --> 00:35:55,715
<b>I'm very rational, you know.</b>

749
00:35:55,739 --> 00:35:58,239
<b>Right. Of course, you are.</b>

750
00:35:59,309 --> 00:36:01,079
<b>Anyway, be nice to him.</b>

751
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:02,655
<b>There aren't many guys...</b>

752
00:36:02,679 --> 00:36:04,879
<b>who are this cooperative
when it comes to their in-laws.</b>

753
00:36:06,309 --> 00:36:07,780
<b>Cooperative?</b>

754
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,349
<b>Only those who don't
know Gyu Jin say that.</b>

755
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:11,690
<b>What?</b>

756
00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:14,690
<b>I'm just saying.
Anyway, I'll get going.</b>

757
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:18,260
<b>Take care then!</b>

758
00:36:18,989 --> 00:36:20,059
<b>- Are you good?
- Yes.</b>

759
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:24,030
<b>This is enough
to feed us for three days.</b>

760
00:36:24,170 --> 00:36:25,575
<b>Gosh, thank you so much.</b>

761
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:28,500
<b>It's nothing.
You must be tired, so get going.</b>

762
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,686
<b>Thank you for enjoying
the meal today.</b>

763
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:34,039
<b>Cooking food is harder
than eating it.</b>

764
00:36:34,679 --> 00:36:36,356
<b>Thank you so much, Mother.</b>

765
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:39,849
<b>I'm the one who should be grateful.</b>

766
00:36:42,119 --> 00:36:45,019
<b>Na Hee is not the most diligent
person around the house, right?</b>

767
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:48,595
<b>Don't I know it.
All she did was study all the time,</b>

768
00:36:48,619 --> 00:36:50,499
<b>so I never got the chance
to teach her anything.</b>

769
00:36:50,789 --> 00:36:54,305
<b>But you understand all that
and make up for what she lacks.</b>

770
00:36:54,329 --> 00:36:57,130
<b>You have no idea
how grateful and sorry I am.</b>

771
00:36:57,599 --> 00:36:58,869
<b>Please don't say that, Mother.</b>

772
00:36:59,369 --> 00:37:02,146
<b>I may not have lucked out
with my kids and husband,</b>

773
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:04,409
<b>but I did with my son-in-law.</b>

774
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:13,726
<b>Are you two
filming a movie or something?</b>

775
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:16,619
<b>Well, who says that we can't?</b>

776
00:37:18,889 --> 00:37:20,566
<b>I'm exhausted, so let's go.</b>

777
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:22,619
<b>- Right, go ahead.
- Right.</b>

778
00:37:33,429 --> 00:37:34,500
<b>Stop the car.</b>

779
00:37:46,010 --> 00:37:48,980
<b>Just let me drive you home.
We're both going there anyway.</b>

780
00:37:49,449 --> 00:37:51,325
<b>It's better for the environment.</b>

781
00:37:51,349 --> 00:37:52,750
<b>I'd rather not cross the line.</b>

782
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:02,760
<b>My mom cooked this,
so this is mine, right?</b>

783
00:38:03,099 --> 00:38:05,170
<b>Mother packed it for me.</b>

784
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,940
<b>I doubt it was just for you.</b>

785
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:10,486
<b>Besides, how is she
your mother-in-law now?</b>

786
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:11,769
<b>We're not married, remember?</b>

787
00:38:12,969 --> 00:38:15,039
<b>Hey. Just wait!</b>

788
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:20,010
<b>Must she be this cruel
especially with food?</b>

789
00:38:31,290 --> 00:38:32,790
<b>(Episode 10)</b>

790
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:46,785
<b>What brings you by at this hour?</b>

791
00:38:46,809 --> 00:38:49,116
<b>I was on my way home...</b>

792
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:52,039
<b>when the girls suddenly
popped into my head.</b>

793
00:38:52,309 --> 00:38:53,350
<b>Here.</b>

794
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:56,519
<b>I'll give them these tomorrow.</b>

795
00:38:57,649 --> 00:38:58,679
<b>Wait.</b>

796
00:38:59,690 --> 00:39:00,789
<b>Could I...</b>

797
00:39:02,789 --> 00:39:04,960
<b>see the kids for a second?</b>

798
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:09,030
<b>I'll briefly see their faces
and get going.</b>

799
00:39:13,429 --> 00:39:17,270
<b>You sleep just like I do, don't you?</b>

800
00:39:26,909 --> 00:39:28,149
<b>My sweet babies.</b>

801
00:39:29,109 --> 00:39:31,226
<b>You both came out
with pretty faces...</b>

802
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:33,920
<b>to save me money on plastic surgery.</b>

803
00:39:34,890 --> 00:39:36,560
<b>How kind of you.</b>

804
00:39:47,870 --> 00:39:49,030
<b>Dad?</b>

805
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:51,075
<b>Did I wake you?</b>

806
00:39:51,099 --> 00:39:53,409
<b>Gosh, I'm sorry.
You should go back to sleep.</b>

807
00:39:54,969 --> 00:39:56,409
<b>It must be a dream.</b>

808
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:59,079
<b>Still, it's nice
to see you in my dream.</b>

809
00:40:00,909 --> 00:40:02,849
<b>That's right. It's a dream.</b>

810
00:40:04,049 --> 00:40:05,049
<b>Go back to sleep now.</b>

811
00:40:05,549 --> 00:40:06,890
<b>I'm sorry, Seo Young.</b>

812
00:40:08,090 --> 00:40:09,620
<b>I'm sorry about everything.</b>

813
00:40:33,310 --> 00:40:35,310
<b>Thank you for letting me
see the kids.</b>

814
00:40:35,549 --> 00:40:38,756
<b>There's no need to thank me.
You're their father.</b>

815
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:42,150
<b>Right. Yes, I'm their father.</b>

816
00:40:43,419 --> 00:40:45,090
<b>It's late. You should head home.</b>

817
00:40:45,819 --> 00:40:47,360
<b>Hey, Hyun Gyung.</b>

818
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:52,729
<b>Am I doing all right?</b>

819
00:40:55,770 --> 00:40:59,169
<b>Hearing you say
that I'm doing fine...</b>

820
00:40:59,939 --> 00:41:02,139
<b>will give me a boost of energy.</b>

821
00:41:05,409 --> 00:41:06,610
<b>Get home safely then.</b>

822
00:41:24,759 --> 00:41:26,530
<b>You're doing fine...</b>

823
00:41:26,729 --> 00:41:28,609
<b>and you still have
your whole life ahead of you.</b>

824
00:41:43,379 --> 00:41:44,419
<b>She's right.</b>

825
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:47,750
<b>I'm still young
and my life has just begun.</b>

826
00:41:48,919 --> 00:41:52,436
<b>You can do it, Joon Seon.
You're their father!</b>

827
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:54,265
<b>You can do anything.</b>

828
00:41:54,289 --> 00:41:56,400
<b>You crazy jerk, shut it!</b>

829
00:42:06,669 --> 00:42:09,855
<b>Hold on.
Before you excuse yourselves,</b>

830
00:42:09,879 --> 00:42:13,080
<b>I'd like to give you
a short presentation.</b>

831
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:16,150
<b>What nonsense are you spewing
this early in the morning?</b>

832
00:42:17,219 --> 00:42:19,996
<b>It'll be your eldest son's...</b>

833
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:23,389
<b>new business plan for the year 2020.</b>

834
00:42:25,889 --> 00:42:27,330
<b>You'll start another business?</b>

835
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:33,006
<b>Before I begin my briefing,
I'd like to inform you</b>

836
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:35,145
<b>that this is your chance...</b>

837
00:42:35,169 --> 00:42:38,976
<b>to become investors
of the Good Action Company.</b>

838
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,686
<b>First, let me explain
the stunt industry...</b>

839
00:42:41,710 --> 00:42:44,385
<b>regarding its current status
and future.</b>

840
00:42:44,409 --> 00:42:46,326
<b>The current stunt industry...</b>

841
00:42:46,350 --> 00:42:47,379
<b>Uncle Joon Seon,</b>

842
00:42:47,579 --> 00:42:50,295
<b>I'm sorry but I need
to get ready for school.</b>

843
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:52,680
<b>Of course. You can't skip school.
Right, off you go.</b>

844
00:42:53,490 --> 00:42:54,519
<b>- Thanks.
- All right.</b>

845
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:57,689
<b>All right then.</b>

846
00:42:58,120 --> 00:42:59,706
<b>Hold on. Where was I?</b>

847
00:42:59,730 --> 00:43:01,536
<b>The current stunt industry.</b>

848
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:02,959
<b>Right. Thanks.</b>

849
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:05,675
<b>The current stunt industry...</b>

850
00:43:05,699 --> 00:43:07,576
<b>is a monopolistic market.</b>

851
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:09,375
<b>We must channel the energy and...</b>

852
00:43:09,399 --> 00:43:10,670
<b>Enough of that.</b>

853
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,786
<b>What you want is for us to invest
in this crappy idea of yours.</b>

854
00:43:14,810 --> 00:43:18,610
<b>Father, please. Why do you always
have a negative view on things?</b>

855
00:43:18,839 --> 00:43:21,310
<b>Do you know what
makes people a success?</b>

856
00:43:21,579 --> 00:43:23,220
<b>It's the fact...</b>

857
00:43:23,250 --> 00:43:24,425
<b>that they take a step forward...</b>

858
00:43:24,449 --> 00:43:26,350
<b>even though there's only
a one percent chance.</b>

859
00:43:26,389 --> 00:43:28,250
<b>I'd like to have
a positive view on things too,</b>

860
00:43:28,589 --> 00:43:30,235
<b>so please let me be that way.</b>

861
00:43:30,259 --> 00:43:31,665
<b>Yes, exactly.</b>

862
00:43:31,689 --> 00:43:33,906
<b>The bank only offers
a two percent interest these days.</b>

863
00:43:33,930 --> 00:43:36,105
<b>Investing in real estate
gets you only four percent.</b>

864
00:43:36,129 --> 00:43:39,175
<b>Those kinds of investments
won't help you much anyway.</b>

865
00:43:39,199 --> 00:43:40,305
<b>Forget it.</b>

866
00:43:40,329 --> 00:43:43,339
<b>I'm done hearing about this,
so I'll head to my room.</b>

867
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:45,276
<b>But Dad!</b>

868
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:48,209
<b>I need to get an early start
to the day as well.</b>

869
00:43:48,569 --> 00:43:50,740
<b>I should get some more sleep.
Sorry, Joon Seon.</b>

870
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:54,026
<b>I have classes,
so I'll hear you out later on.</b>

871
00:43:54,050 --> 00:43:55,286
<b>But I haven't even started.</b>

872
00:43:55,310 --> 00:43:57,250
<b>Mom, would you like
to hear more of it?</b>

873
00:43:57,579 --> 00:43:59,889
<b>Ga Hee, how about
you hear it in your sleep?</b>

874
00:44:01,949 --> 00:44:02,959
<b>Dad,</b>

875
00:44:03,519 --> 00:44:06,529
<b>I know you don't trust me
and you have every right to.</b>

876
00:44:06,959 --> 00:44:08,966
<b>Still, I'm desperate this time.</b>

877
00:44:08,990 --> 00:44:10,899
<b>Can't you trust me one last time?</b>

878
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:14,000
<b>Desperation shouldn't motivate you.</b>

879
00:44:14,170 --> 00:44:16,446
<b>- You need a vision.
- And that I have!</b>

880
00:44:16,470 --> 00:44:18,276
<b>You know the stunt coordinator
Jung Doo Hong, right?</b>

881
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:19,315
<b>- He...
- Forget it.</b>

882
00:44:19,339 --> 00:44:22,439
<b>If you want to run a business,
come work at the chicken place.</b>

883
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:23,815
<b>Dad,</b>

884
00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:26,879
<b>I told you that I'd never
fry chicken for a living.</b>

885
00:44:27,250 --> 00:44:28,680
<b>You imbecile!</b>

886
00:44:29,110 --> 00:44:32,019
<b>What's wrong about
frying chicken for a living?</b>

887
00:44:32,379 --> 00:44:35,420
<b>What money
do you think I raised you with?</b>

888
00:44:36,589 --> 00:44:39,766
<b>You kids should be
bowing to the chicken I fried.</b>

889
00:44:39,790 --> 00:44:41,329
<b>I know that Dad,</b>

890
00:44:41,629 --> 00:44:43,730
<b>but please give me one more chance.</b>

891
00:44:43,899 --> 00:44:45,500
<b>Just this once.</b>

892
00:44:46,769 --> 00:44:48,730
<b>No way. I'm done.</b>

893
00:44:50,540 --> 00:44:52,569
<b>Leave the room.
I need to change my underwear.</b>

894
00:44:53,310 --> 00:44:54,415
<b>Let me do that for you.</b>

895
00:44:54,439 --> 00:44:56,209
<b>Okay, fine. I'm leaving.</b>

896
00:44:57,009 --> 00:44:58,079
<b>Mom?</b>

897
00:44:58,939 --> 00:45:00,779
<b>Mom...</b>

898
00:45:02,009 --> 00:45:03,456
<b>Just stop it already.</b>

899
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:06,649
<b>I barely have any money
to put food on the table.</b>

900
00:45:06,949 --> 00:45:09,696
<b>I took 100 dollars
from your dad last night.</b>

901
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:11,620
<b>- How about I give you that?
- Yes.</b>

902
00:45:13,889 --> 00:45:15,589
<b>Da Hee, hold up.</b>

903
00:45:16,430 --> 00:45:18,529
<b>Actually, you get a pass.</b>

904
00:45:18,759 --> 00:45:19,829
<b>I'm sorry Joon Seon.</b>

905
00:45:19,870 --> 00:45:21,100
<b>When I earn enough money,</b>

906
00:45:21,129 --> 00:45:22,870
<b>I'll make sure
to invest in your company.</b>

907
00:45:22,899 --> 00:45:25,245
<b>Good luck. I'm off!</b>

908
00:45:25,269 --> 00:45:28,139
<b>Will I be around 60
when she earns enough money?</b>

909
00:45:30,439 --> 00:45:34,050
<b>Ga Hee, the most
beautiful lady on the planet.</b>

910
00:45:34,579 --> 00:45:37,579
<b>I'm completely broke, you know.
There's no point in asking me.</b>

911
00:45:38,050 --> 00:45:40,250
<b>Really? Are you sure you're broke?</b>

912
00:45:40,550 --> 00:45:43,089
<b>Don't you have
a few thousand dollars stashed?</b>

913
00:45:44,389 --> 00:45:47,235
<b>I'd like nothing more

<b>who can invest in your new project.</b>

915
00:45:50,430 --> 00:45:52,560
<b>Just talking about it
makes me ashamed of myself.</b>

916
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,199
<b>Fine, penniless sister.</b>

917
00:45:58,939 --> 00:46:01,485
<b>The presentation will be in a month.
You know that, right?</b>

918
00:46:01,509 --> 00:46:02,516
<b>- Yes.
- Sure.</b>

919
00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:04,815
<b>Sung Woo, make sure
we're registered to speak.</b>

920
00:46:04,839 --> 00:46:07,125
<b>- Got it.
- Joo Hyuk, come up with...</b>

921
00:46:07,149 --> 00:46:08,355
<b>a mock question sheet by this week.</b>

922
00:46:08,379 --> 00:46:11,226
<b>Next week, I'll start working on
the presentation material...</b>

923
00:46:11,250 --> 00:46:13,149
<b>(Neulpuleun Children's Hospital)</b>

924
00:46:14,649 --> 00:46:16,689
<b>Hi, Joon Seon. This is a surprise.</b>

925
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:19,259
<b>Where?</b>

926
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:21,160
<b>Na Hee!</b>

927
00:46:22,129 --> 00:46:23,336
<b>What brings you by?</b>

928
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:25,230
<b>Seo Jin doesn't have
an appointment today.</b>

929
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:28,675
<b>I saw walnut buns
and was reminded of you.</b>

930
00:46:28,699 --> 00:46:30,600
<b>Have some while they're hot.</b>

931
00:46:31,899 --> 00:46:33,670
<b>What's wrong? You love these.</b>

932
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:35,569
<b>- Do I?
- Don't you?</b>

933
00:46:36,009 --> 00:46:37,485
<b>Then you can like them as of today.</b>

934
00:46:37,509 --> 00:46:39,579
<b>Try one. They're delicious.</b>

935
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:46,949
<b>- How much?
- What? How much is what?</b>

936
00:46:47,290 --> 00:46:49,550
<b>You want money, don't you? How much?</b>

937
00:46:49,589 --> 00:46:51,565
<b>Don't be ridiculous.
I only brought these...</b>

938
00:46:51,589 --> 00:46:53,305
<b>for you to enjoy. Really.</b>

939
00:46:53,329 --> 00:46:55,406
<b>Just tell me already. Would you
rather go home empty-handed?</b>

940
00:46:55,430 --> 00:46:56,875
<b>I need to see patients.</b>

941
00:46:56,899 --> 00:46:59,160
<b>20,000 dollars
or at least 10,000 dollars.</b>

942
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:01,546
<b>20,000 dollars?
Did you get into trouble again?</b>

943
00:47:01,570 --> 00:47:03,416
<b>No, of course not.
I'm thinking of opening...</b>

944
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:05,340
<b>my own talent agency
for stunt performers.</b>

945
00:47:06,570 --> 00:47:08,716
<b>Joon Seon, the economy
is bad right now.</b>

946
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:11,515
<b>It might be wiser to
receive a salary yourself instead.</b>

947
00:47:11,539 --> 00:47:14,809
<b>I know that but it's just
where I'm at right now.</b>

948
00:47:15,149 --> 00:47:17,049
<b>Can't you help me?</b>

949
00:47:18,049 --> 00:47:19,525
<b>I can't believe
you bought walnut buns...</b>

950
00:47:19,549 --> 00:47:21,326
<b>when you're asking me
for 20,000 dollars.</b>

951
00:47:21,350 --> 00:47:23,519
<b>You can be really stingy, you know.</b>

952
00:47:24,389 --> 00:47:26,605
<b>I'm sorry, but I don't
have the money either.</b>

953
00:47:26,629 --> 00:47:28,259
<b>I'll be needing it too, I'm afraid.</b>

954
00:47:28,529 --> 00:47:30,706
<b>I guess I can spare
about 5,000 dollars.</b>

955
00:47:30,730 --> 00:47:31,759
<b>5,000 dollars?</b>

956
00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:34,370
<b>Unbelievable.</b>

957
00:47:34,730 --> 00:47:36,740
<b>It still wouldn't be
a wise investment on my part.</b>

958
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:39,000
<b>In order to start a business,</b>

959
00:47:39,039 --> 00:47:40,940
<b>one must do proper research
and have a vision.</b>

960
00:47:40,970 --> 00:47:43,515
<b>- But you never...
- I'll take what you can give.</b>

961
00:47:43,539 --> 00:47:45,940
<b>And stop with your nagging.
I'll take the 5,000 dollars.</b>

962
00:47:46,909 --> 00:47:47,980
<b>See you.</b>

963
00:47:50,419 --> 00:47:52,120
<b>And now you're taking
what you bought me.</b>

964
00:47:53,389 --> 00:47:55,265
<b>Na Hee was my last hope...</b>

965
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:56,889
<b>which means I'm done for.</b>

966
00:47:58,259 --> 00:48:00,259
<b>Isn't there anyone
who has money lying around?</b>

967
00:48:00,990 --> 00:48:03,830
<b>I'd give up everything
for money to fall out of the sky.</b>

968
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:07,769
<b>- Joon Seon?
- Gyu Jin, hi!</b>

969
00:48:08,970 --> 00:48:10,716
<b>It sure is nice to see you here.</b>

970
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:12,216
<b>What brings you by though?</b>

971
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:14,285
<b>Are you here
for Seo Jin's treatment?</b>

972
00:48:14,309 --> 00:48:15,570
<b>Not exactly.</b>

973
00:48:18,309 --> 00:48:20,210
<b>Do you perhaps
have some time to spare?</b>

974
00:48:20,779 --> 00:48:23,320
<b>This field is like any other field.</b>

975
00:48:23,950 --> 00:48:25,779
<b>I'm not as young...</b>

976
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:28,149
<b>or in great shape as I used to be.</b>

977
00:48:28,549 --> 00:48:31,166
<b>It's embarrassing to work under
a junior stuntman too.</b>

978
00:48:31,190 --> 00:48:32,360
<b>Let me help.</b>

979
00:48:33,190 --> 00:48:35,330
<b>- What?
- You want to start a business.</b>

980
00:48:37,259 --> 00:48:38,330
<b>Still,</b>

981
00:48:40,169 --> 00:48:42,375
<b>I don't have
a lot to spare right now,</b>

982
00:48:42,399 --> 00:48:45,875
<b>and I can only lend you
about 8,000 dollars.</b>

983
00:48:45,899 --> 00:48:47,940
<b>- Would that be okay?
- 8,000 dollars?</b>

984
00:48:48,570 --> 00:48:51,080
<b>That's more than enough!</b>

985
00:48:51,379 --> 00:48:53,450
<b>- Thanks, Gyu Jin.
- Don't mention it.</b>

986
00:48:54,509 --> 00:48:56,820
<b>However, promise me...</b>

987
00:48:58,519 --> 00:49:01,419
<b>that you won't tell Na Hee.
It's from my secret stash.</b>

988
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:05,889
<b>Are you sure I can take this?
I feel shameful for some reason.</b>

989
00:49:06,690 --> 00:49:09,035
<b>It's fine. I'm investing in you...</b>

990
00:49:09,059 --> 00:49:11,206
<b>because I see the potential.</b>

991
00:49:11,230 --> 00:49:13,269
<b>I'm a big fan of your stunts.</b>

992
00:49:13,730 --> 00:49:17,240
<b>Gyu Jin, thank you so much.
This is a huge help.</b>

993
00:49:17,769 --> 00:49:20,409
<b>I'll wire it to your account
right away.</b>

994
00:49:22,210 --> 00:49:23,679
<b>You can't tell Na Hee, okay?</b>

995
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:25,509
<b>I won't.</b>

996
00:49:26,139 --> 00:49:27,980
<b>- Promise me.
- I promise you.</b>

997
00:49:29,450 --> 00:49:31,279
<b>Of course, I don't have money.</b>

998
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:33,566
<b>I send everything I earn
to our parents...</b>

999
00:49:33,590 --> 00:49:35,826
<b>and you come by
whenever I've saved some up.</b>

1000
00:49:35,850 --> 00:49:37,995
<b>I can barely put food on the table.</b>

1001
00:49:38,019 --> 00:49:40,629
<b>- So get lost.
- What can I do then?</b>

1002
00:49:40,789 --> 00:49:42,405
<b>The baby will be born soon,</b>

1003
00:49:42,429 --> 00:49:45,429
<b>so I need the money
to find us a decent place to stay.</b>

1004
00:49:45,529 --> 00:49:47,799
<b>Whatever. Your life
is yours to manage.</b>

1005
00:49:48,269 --> 00:49:50,115
<b>I'm broke too, so sue me.</b>

1006
00:49:50,139 --> 00:49:51,769
<b>Is this how it's going to be?</b>

1007
00:49:52,570 --> 00:49:54,840
<b>Should I go back to gambling again?</b>

1008
00:49:56,009 --> 00:49:58,115
<b>How dare...</b>

1009
00:49:58,139 --> 00:49:59,556
<b>- you say that.
- That hurts!</b>

1010
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:01,250
<b>- I'll kill myself.
- Unbelievable.</b>

1011
00:50:08,090 --> 00:50:09,120
<b>Here you go.</b>

1012
00:50:11,019 --> 00:50:11,996
<b>What's this?</b>

1013
00:50:12,020 --> 00:50:13,960
<b>Get your brother a place to stay.</b>

1014
00:50:14,590 --> 00:50:17,259
<b>It'll be enough for a deposit.</b>

1015
00:50:17,799 --> 00:50:20,330
<b>- Cho Yeon...
- Unbelievable.</b>

1016
00:50:20,769 --> 00:50:24,799
<b>No wonder you were
on the phone for so long.</b>

1017
00:50:25,039 --> 00:50:27,785
<b>Why didn't you come to me for help?</b>

1018
00:50:27,809 --> 00:50:30,309
<b>I can't believe you were
trying to handle it yourself.</b>

1019
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:32,586
<b>Didn't you sign the lease today?</b>

1020
00:50:32,610 --> 00:50:33,980
<b>How will you make the payments?</b>

1021
00:50:34,149 --> 00:50:36,779
<b>It's fine.
There are other places I can go.</b>

1022
00:50:37,519 --> 00:50:39,120
<b>I'll find something cheaper.</b>

1023
00:50:39,850 --> 00:50:42,566
<b>If nothing pans out,
I can also head out of the city.</b>

1024
00:50:42,590 --> 00:50:44,620
<b>I'm getting sick and tired
of Seoul anyway.</b>

1025
00:50:45,490 --> 00:50:47,730
<b>- Cho Yeon...
- Wait, hold that.</b>

1026
00:50:47,990 --> 00:50:49,666
<b>I don't do touching moments,</b>

1027
00:50:49,690 --> 00:50:51,206
<b>so don't you dare.</b>

1028
00:50:51,230 --> 00:50:54,176
<b>Cho Yeon, thanks. I love you.</b>

1029
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:56,076
<b>You know I hate physical contact.</b>

1030
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:58,875
<b>- Let go of me.
- Guys, I love you too!</b>

1031
00:50:58,899 --> 00:51:00,515
<b>What on earth?</b>

1032
00:51:00,539 --> 00:51:01,686
<b>My cheeks are about to explode.</b>

1033
00:51:01,710 --> 00:51:05,285
<b>Guys, let me breathe, okay?</b>

1034
00:51:05,309 --> 00:51:06,669
<b>You'll crush my face at this rate.</b>

1035
00:51:19,190 --> 00:51:21,635
<b>Ji Hun, that wasn't on purpose.</b>

1036
00:51:21,659 --> 00:51:23,559
<b>- Are you sure?
- I think it was.</b>

1037
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:27,629
<b>Tae Jin!</b>

1038
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:29,200
<b>Dad!</b>

1039
00:51:33,139 --> 00:51:34,385
<b>Did you have fun today?</b>

1040
00:51:34,409 --> 00:51:35,870
<b>- How were your classes?
- I had fun.</b>

1041
00:51:36,009 --> 00:51:38,610
<b>That's my boy. Let's get going.</b>

1042
00:51:39,639 --> 00:51:40,710
<b>Here you go.</b>

1043
00:51:48,350 --> 00:51:50,025
<b>- I'm home.
- Hi.</b>

1044
00:51:50,049 --> 00:51:51,466
<b>Auntie is in the bathroom.</b>

1045
00:51:51,490 --> 00:51:52,995
<b>Aren't you going to answer me?</b>

1046
00:51:53,019 --> 00:51:54,860
<b>You always seem to ignore me
and it's annoying.</b>

1047
00:51:55,259 --> 00:51:56,429
<b>Hi, Seo Young.</b>

1048
00:51:57,129 --> 00:51:58,399
<b>It went dead again.</b>

1049
00:51:58,799 --> 00:52:01,230
<b>Ji Hun, hold on.</b>

1050
00:52:01,399 --> 00:52:04,015
<b>Can I borrow your phone?
Mom put a time limit on mine...</b>

- No way.</b>

1052
00:52:07,409 --> 00:52:09,785
<b>Let me borrow it for a while.
I won't snoop around.</b>

1053
00:52:09,809 --> 00:52:10,909
<b>No.</b>

1054
00:52:11,409 --> 00:52:12,940
<b>Please!</b>

1055
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:15,655
<b>Just for 30 minutes.</b>

1056
00:52:15,679 --> 00:52:18,250
<b>- Hey, you're bleeding!
- I said no!</b>

1057
00:52:20,820 --> 00:52:23,590
<b>Just stop bothering me.</b>

1058
00:52:32,129 --> 00:52:33,159
<b>What was that?</b>

1059
00:52:33,529 --> 00:52:34,600
<b>Wow.</b>

1060
00:52:34,830 --> 00:52:38,346
<b>What? Was it Ji Hun who just yelled?</b>

1061
00:52:38,370 --> 00:52:40,940
<b>I guess he's going through puberty.</b>

1062
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:45,210
<b>I see. It's about time.
He's 11 years and 3 months old.</b>

1063
00:52:45,809 --> 00:52:47,285
<b>I know it's true, but...</b>

1064
00:52:47,309 --> 00:52:50,419
<b>By the way,
his fingernails were bleeding.</b>

1065
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:53,149
<b>It must sting a lot.</b>

1066
00:53:11,269 --> 00:53:13,840
<b>Ji Hun, are you hungry?
Do you want a sandwich?</b>

1067
00:53:15,269 --> 00:53:17,509
<b>No. I'm not hungry.</b>

1068
00:53:18,409 --> 00:53:19,539
<b>You aren't?</b>

1069
00:53:20,409 --> 00:53:22,149
<b>Did you eat a lot for lunch?</b>

1070
00:53:22,409 --> 00:53:23,950
<b>What did you have at school?</b>

1071
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:27,350
<b>Today? I had curry and rice.</b>

1072
00:53:28,149 --> 00:53:29,289
<b>I ate a lot.</b>

1073
00:53:30,190 --> 00:53:31,220
<b>I see.</b>

1074
00:53:33,289 --> 00:53:35,460
<b>Was everything okay at school?</b>

1075
00:53:37,860 --> 00:53:39,659
<b>Yes. It was fine.</b>

1076
00:53:44,299 --> 00:53:46,769
<b>If you want to bring a friend home,
you can do that.</b>

1077
00:53:47,309 --> 00:53:49,340
<b>I'll order jajangmyeon
and tangsuyuk for you.</b>

1078
00:53:51,039 --> 00:53:52,039
<b>Okay.</b>

1079
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:54,149
<b>I should do homework.</b>

1080
00:53:55,250 --> 00:53:57,919
<b>What? Okay.</b>

1081
00:54:00,549 --> 00:54:02,495
<b>Tell me if you're hungry, Ji Hun.</b>

1082
00:54:02,519 --> 00:54:04,559
<b>Okay. I will.</b>

1083
00:54:31,620 --> 00:54:32,649
<b>Wait.</b>

1084
00:54:34,820 --> 00:54:38,690
<b>If Joon Seon calls you,
just make things up and play dumb.</b>

1085
00:54:38,860 --> 00:54:41,029
<b>Why? Is something wrong with him?</b>

1086
00:54:41,529 --> 00:54:43,860
<b>You don't have to know.
Just do as I say.</b>

1087
00:54:44,399 --> 00:54:47,005
<b>Did he call you already?</b>

1088
00:54:47,029 --> 00:54:48,429
<b>No, he didn't.</b>

1089
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:52,840
<b>Gyu Jin, are you going home already?</b>

1090
00:54:52,940 --> 00:54:54,145
<b>Come home with me.</b>

1091
00:54:54,169 --> 00:54:56,846
<b>I want to escape Mom's attention
just for one day.</b>

1092
00:54:56,870 --> 00:54:58,285
<b>I can't do that.</b>

1093
00:54:58,309 --> 00:55:00,649
<b>Na Hee, please help me.</b>

1094
00:55:01,049 --> 00:55:02,686
<b>You know that doesn't make sense.</b>

1095
00:55:02,710 --> 00:55:05,179
<b>What should I do then?</b>

1096
00:55:05,379 --> 00:55:09,025
<b>Gyu Jin, I got five calls today.</b>

1097
00:55:09,049 --> 00:55:10,990
<b>And she sent me seven text messages.</b>

1098
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:13,929
<b>What if I'm tortured to death?</b>

1099
00:55:14,159 --> 00:55:16,206
<b>Gyu Jin, how will you deal with it?</b>

1100
00:55:16,230 --> 00:55:18,905
<b>Na Hee, how will you deal
with that guilt?</b>

1101
00:55:18,929 --> 00:55:20,905
<b>- You won't die.
- Life is so tenacious.</b>

1102
00:55:20,929 --> 00:55:21,970
<b>It won't happen.</b>

1103
00:55:22,529 --> 00:55:25,899
<b>You two are so mean.
You can't do this to me.</b>

1104
00:55:26,570 --> 00:55:29,846
<b>If you don't have any ideas,
I'll just tell her about you two.</b>

1105
00:55:29,870 --> 00:55:31,840
<b>- You can't do that!
- You can't do that!</b>

1106
00:55:34,349 --> 00:55:35,450
<b>What?</b>

1107
00:55:36,210 --> 00:55:40,396
<b>Gosh, look at you two
with your perfect teamwork.</b>

1108
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:42,119
<b>I wonder why you broke up.</b>

1109
00:55:48,490 --> 00:55:49,490
<b>Fine.</b>

1110
00:55:50,329 --> 00:55:51,359
<b>I get it.</b>

1111
00:55:52,460 --> 00:55:53,976
<b>It's happened already.</b>

1112
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,505
<b>It's all my fault that I made...</b>

1113
00:55:56,529 --> 00:55:59,339
<b>the wrong choice for loyalty.
It really is.</b>

1114
00:56:00,809 --> 00:56:01,815
<b>Fine.</b>

1115
00:56:01,839 --> 00:56:02,869
<b>You should go.</b>

1116
00:56:03,009 --> 00:56:05,779
<b>Go enjoy your golden lives
and live well.</b>

1117
00:56:09,410 --> 00:56:13,650
<b>All right. Good luck.
Make sure to flatter Mom.</b>

1118
00:56:50,460 --> 00:56:53,730
<b>(Ms. Song)</b>

1119
00:56:57,660 --> 00:56:59,780
<b>(Please don't put gum
and toilet paper in the toilet.)</b>

1120
00:56:59,900 --> 00:57:01,069
<b>Welcome.</b>

1121
00:57:05,140 --> 00:57:08,515
<b>Thank you for your hard work,
Ms. Song.</b>

1122
00:57:08,539 --> 00:57:12,240
<b>Hello, Mr. Yoon.
Are you going home now?</b>

1123
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:14,825
<b>Ms. Choi went home early today.</b>

1124
00:57:14,849 --> 00:57:16,426
<b>I know she's not here.</b>

1125
00:57:16,450 --> 00:57:18,220
<b>I needed to brace myself
before heading home.</b>

1126
00:57:20,819 --> 00:57:23,795
<b>- Would you like something to drink?
- It's okay.</b>

1127
00:57:23,819 --> 00:57:26,519
<b>Please don't mind me
and continue what you were doing.</b>

1128
00:57:27,559 --> 00:57:28,559
<b>Okay.</b>

1129
00:57:49,049 --> 00:57:50,285
<b>What?</b>

1130
00:57:50,309 --> 00:57:52,255
<b>What? What did I do?</b>

1131
00:57:52,279 --> 00:57:55,220
<b>Nothing. It's nothing.</b>

1132
00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:01,890
<b>Ms. Song.</b>

1133
00:58:02,859 --> 00:58:05,559
<b>Do you really not know me?</b>

1134
00:58:05,730 --> 00:58:09,430
<b>Of course, I do. You're my in-law.</b>

1135
00:58:09,869 --> 00:58:14,015
<b>My brother-in-law's brother.
And my boss' son.</b>

1136
00:58:14,039 --> 00:58:16,085
<b>Oh, is that it?</b>

1137
00:58:16,109 --> 00:58:18,055
<b>Do you still not remember
the cart bar?</b>

1138
00:58:18,079 --> 00:58:21,085
<b>I said it wasn't me.
Why would you keep saying that?</b>

1139
00:58:21,109 --> 00:58:25,049
<b>I see. I'm so sorry then.</b>

1140
00:58:25,319 --> 00:58:29,319
<b>But the thing is, I was robbed
by that woman at the cart bar.</b>

1141
00:58:29,490 --> 00:58:31,636
<b>What? You were robbed?</b>

1142
00:58:31,660 --> 00:58:34,335
<b>Yes. She said she'd pay
for the drinks,</b>

1143
00:58:34,359 --> 00:58:37,436
<b>but she just ran away after paying
only part of it while I was away.</b>

1144
00:58:37,460 --> 00:58:38,976
<b>So she's a robber.</b>

1145
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:42,906
<b>Well... You can't call her
a robber for that.</b>

1146
00:58:42,930 --> 00:58:44,845
<b>That's not true. She's a robber.</b>

1147
00:58:44,869 --> 00:58:46,745
<b>She's the one who ordered
the drinks and the food.</b>

1148
00:58:46,769 --> 00:58:48,345
<b>And she ate it all.</b>

1149
00:58:48,369 --> 00:58:50,240
<b>Then she... My gosh.</b>

1150
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:52,916
<b>Look at this.</b>

1151
00:58:52,940 --> 00:58:55,426
<b>She just ran away
after leaving this message.</b>

1152
00:58:55,450 --> 00:58:56,509
<b>Look.</b>

1153
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:02,426
<b>Should I go to the police
to catch her?</b>

1154
00:59:02,450 --> 00:59:05,619
<b>Maybe I should go to the NFS.</b>

1155
00:59:05,789 --> 00:59:07,160
<b>My gosh.</b>

1156
00:59:08,829 --> 00:59:09,930
<b>Hang on.</b>

1157
00:59:10,430 --> 00:59:12,550
<b>(Please don't put gum
and toilet paper in the toilet.)</b>

1158
00:59:12,630 --> 00:59:16,146
<b>I think your handwriting
looks very similar.</b>

1159
00:59:16,170 --> 00:59:17,476
<b>Even the squirrel. Right?</b>

1160
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:19,446
<b>Gosh, that's not true.
It looks totally different.</b>

1161
00:59:19,470 --> 00:59:20,886
<b>Give me that. Let me compare them.</b>

1162
00:59:20,910 --> 00:59:23,315
<b>No, I can't.
I should put these up.</b>

1163
00:59:23,339 --> 00:59:26,480
<b>Wait. Give me that. Hang on.</b>

1164
00:59:29,609 --> 00:59:31,720
<b>Just give me that.</b>

1165
00:59:34,089 --> 00:59:36,519
<b>She just can't hide
that she's flustered.</b>

1166
00:59:36,849 --> 00:59:38,619
<b>It makes me want
to tease her even more.</b>

1167
00:59:43,829 --> 00:59:44,960
<b>They call this cheap?</b>

1168
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,575
<b>A 40,000-dollar deposit
and 2,000-dollar rent?</b>

1169
00:59:46,599 --> 00:59:49,146
<b>Gosh. I guess everyone is rich...</b>

1170
00:59:49,170 --> 00:59:50,529
<b>except me.</b>

1171
00:59:51,799 --> 00:59:54,269
<b>What can I do with 13,000 dollars?</b>

1172
00:59:55,410 --> 00:59:58,140
<b>Gosh. Darn it.</b>

1173
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:02,156
<b>No. I'm a man.
I have drawn my sword...</b>

1174
01:00:02,180 --> 01:00:04,119
<b>and it cannot be sheathed
until it draws blood.</b>

1175
01:00:04,450 --> 01:00:07,265
<b>Right. I'm Song Joon Seon.</b>

1176
01:00:07,289 --> 01:00:08,765
<b>I just have to do
with what I've got.</b>

1177
01:00:08,789 --> 01:00:10,450
<b>If I don't have money,
I need tenacity.</b>

1178
01:00:10,549 --> 01:00:14,206
<b>All right.
I just have to brazen it out.</b>

1179
01:00:14,230 --> 01:00:15,289
<b>Be shameless.</b>

1180
01:00:19,329 --> 01:00:22,376
<b>Gosh. Give me that, Dad.</b>

1181
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:24,946
<b>You should call me
for things like this.</b>

1182
01:00:24,970 --> 01:00:26,745
<b>You might hurt your back.</b>

1183
01:00:26,769 --> 01:00:29,485
<b>It's not that heavy.</b>

1184
01:00:29,509 --> 01:00:31,515
<b>You might strain your back.</b>

1185
01:00:31,539 --> 01:00:33,009
<b>You should think of your age.</b>

1186
01:00:33,210 --> 01:00:35,426
<b>You know you're the light
of our family.</b>

1187

<b>Your body isn't all yours.</b>

1188
01:00:38,180 --> 01:00:39,880
<b>I said no.</b>

1189
01:00:40,079 --> 01:00:42,250
<b>Dad, please.</b>

1190
01:00:42,349 --> 01:00:44,735
<b>I've attracted investments
of 13,000 dollars.</b>

1191
01:00:44,759 --> 01:00:48,005
<b>With an extra 20,000 dollars,
I can get a semi-basement room.</b>

1192
01:00:48,029 --> 01:00:50,366
<b>I'll pay five percent interest.</b>

1193
01:00:50,390 --> 01:00:52,599
<b>No, let's make it 7,
What about 7 percent interest?</b>

1194
01:00:52,730 --> 01:00:54,845
<b>I'm not going to run
a moneylending business with you.</b>

1195
01:00:54,869 --> 01:00:56,876
<b>I'm doing this

<b>I have people who count on me.</b>

1197
01:00:58,339 --> 01:01:01,116
<b>Forget it. If you talk more,
you will just waste your time.</b>

1198

<b>All that debt is only going to
get you into trouble.</b>

1199
01:01:04,009 --> 01:01:06,085
<b>Don't try to run a business

1200
01:01:06,109 --> 01:01:07,525
<b>You should try to steadily

1201
01:01:07,549 --> 01:01:09,325
<b>It's not like you're a stranger.</b>

1202

<b>Think of me as a stranger.</b>

<b>My money isn't yours.</b>

1204

<b>Dad.</b>

1205
01:01:17,250 --> 01:01:18,319
<b>Gosh.</b>

1206
01:01:22,329 --> 01:01:23,490
<b>I can't believe this.</b>

1207

<b>You're his dad. Can't you at least

1208
01:01:30,069 --> 01:01:31,140
<b>What?</b>

1209
01:01:31,599 --> 01:01:33,815
<b>He wants to start something

1210
01:01:33,839 --> 01:01:36,116
<b>You can at least hear
what his plan is...</b>

1211
01:01:36,140 --> 01:01:38,386
<b>We know what he's like.</b>

1212
01:01:38,410 --> 01:01:41,750
<b>It's not his first time to ask
for money trying to start something.</b>

1213
01:01:42,980 --> 01:01:45,025
<b>He lost money after
guaranteeing a debt for a friend.</b>

1214
01:01:45,049 --> 01:01:47,226
<b>And he lost money again
running a business with a friend.</b>

1215
01:01:47,250 --> 01:01:49,825
<b>He doesn't seem clever at all.</b>

1216
01:01:49,849 --> 01:01:51,490
<b>Why would I give him money again?</b>

1217
01:01:51,759 --> 01:01:54,559
<b>I have no money to spare.
I don't even have enough for myself.</b>

1218
01:01:55,230 --> 01:01:57,160
<b>But he's your son.</b>

1219
01:01:57,430 --> 01:02:00,869
<b>It's not like
he will be unlucky forever.</b>

1220
01:02:01,099 --> 01:02:03,345
<b>He's been doing this for 14 years.</b>

1221
01:02:03,369 --> 01:02:05,500
<b>It might go well if he starts
his own business.</b>

1222
01:02:05,700 --> 01:02:09,285
<b>Gosh, have you not give up yet?</b>

1223
01:02:09,309 --> 01:02:11,910
<b>You're truly unbelievable.</b>

1224
01:02:12,339 --> 01:02:15,950
<b>What kind of parent would
give up on her own son?</b>

1225
01:02:18,180 --> 01:02:21,325
<b>I see. You're so determined
when it comes to money.</b>

1226
01:02:21,349 --> 01:02:23,896
<b>You will make a lot of money
and die with it in your arms.</b>

1227
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:26,220
<b>Your grave will be
packed with money.</b>

1228
01:02:26,460 --> 01:02:28,436
<b>Are you cursing me to die now?</b>

1229
01:02:28,460 --> 01:02:30,735
<b>- It's just a figure of speech.
- My gosh.</b>

1230
01:02:30,759 --> 01:02:31,829
<b>Why complain?</b>

1231
01:02:32,799 --> 01:02:33,936
<b>Oh, ma'am.</b>

1232
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:36,000
<b>Ma'am, you're out today.</b>

1233
01:02:36,230 --> 01:02:37,745
<b>- I'll pull it for you.
- No.</b>

1234
01:02:37,769 --> 01:02:39,345
<b>- It's fine.
- It's okay.</b>

1235
01:02:39,369 --> 01:02:40,769
<b>You're early today.</b>

1236
01:02:41,140 --> 01:02:42,985
<b>- Did you have breakfast?
- Yes, I did.</b>

1237
01:02:43,009 --> 01:02:46,309
<b>He has such a weird temper.</b>

1238
01:02:46,609 --> 01:02:47,926
<b>Wouldn't it be nice...</b>

1239
01:02:47,950 --> 01:02:49,686
<b>if he were half as nice to his kids?</b>

1240
01:02:49,710 --> 01:02:53,519
<b>My goodness. He's so mean.</b>

1241
01:02:54,289 --> 01:02:57,349
<b>Young Dal is a bit harsh
on the kids.</b>

1242
01:02:57,660 --> 01:02:58,859
<b>Especially Joon Seon.</b>

1243
01:02:59,490 --> 01:03:00,467
<b>Exactly.</b>

1244
01:03:00,491 --> 01:03:03,235
<b>He makes him pay rent
every single month.</b>

1245
01:03:03,259 --> 01:03:05,160
<b>He's so nasty.</b>

1246
01:03:05,960 --> 01:03:08,529
<b>What about him did you like so much?</b>

1247
01:03:09,299 --> 01:03:12,339
<b>- What?
- I kind of remember a lot.</b>

1248
01:03:12,599 --> 01:03:14,015
<b>You fell in love with...</b>

1249
01:03:14,039 --> 01:03:17,045
<b>Young Dal who worked at
our mill at the time.</b>

1250
01:03:17,069 --> 01:03:19,755
<b>You wailed that
you'd die without him.</b>

1251
01:03:19,779 --> 01:03:22,525
<b>Dad even shaved your head.</b>

1252
01:03:22,549 --> 01:03:25,696
<b>I know.
I fell for his guitar skills...</b>

1253
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:27,990
<b>and totally lost my mind.</b>

1254
01:03:29,289 --> 01:03:31,160
<b>Love does make you crazy.</b>

1255
01:03:31,519 --> 01:03:34,019
<b>Once you're head over heels,
there's no cure.</b>

1256
01:03:34,430 --> 01:03:36,706
<b>What'll happen to
the dumpling place?</b>

1257
01:03:36,730 --> 01:03:38,075
<b>I hope they find a new tenant...</b>

1258
01:03:38,099 --> 01:03:41,406
<b>or Yun Jeong will take out
her stress on Na Hee.</b>

1259
01:03:41,430 --> 01:03:42,670
<b>I know.</b>

1260
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:45,240
<b>When I think of Yun Jeong,
I think it serves her right,</b>

1261
01:03:45,799 --> 01:03:47,509
<b>but it does worry me too.</b>

1262
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:49,545
<b>No one who knows what happened...</b>

1263
01:03:49,569 --> 01:03:51,539
<b>will want to rent that space.</b>

1264
01:03:51,779 --> 01:03:54,555
<b>Ok Boon, can you fry up
a whole chicken right now?</b>

1265
01:03:54,579 --> 01:03:56,710
<b>Yes, of course. It won't take long.</b>

1266
01:03:57,210 --> 01:03:59,519
<b>By the way, have you heard?</b>

1267
01:03:59,849 --> 01:04:01,589
<b>The dumpling store was let out.</b>

1268
01:04:02,319 --> 01:04:04,220
<b>My gosh. Someone rented it?</b>

1269
01:04:04,390 --> 01:04:06,735
<b>- For real?
- Yes, for real.</b>

1270
01:04:06,759 --> 01:04:09,606
<b>I just met the real estate agent.</b>

1271
01:04:09,630 --> 01:04:11,035
<b>Someone signed today.</b>

1272
01:04:11,059 --> 01:04:13,029
<b>The space got rented out? Really?</b>

1273
01:04:13,329 --> 01:04:14,599
<b>Yes, really.</b>

1274
01:04:14,970 --> 01:04:18,839
<b>Ok Ja said the dried goods seller
heard from the real estate agent.</b>

1275
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:23,140
<b>Really? Gosh, that's great news.</b>

1276
01:04:23,410 --> 01:04:26,015
<b>I was worried it would
stay empty for a long time.</b>

1277
01:04:26,039 --> 01:04:27,210
<b>It's a relief.</b>

1278
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:30,849
<b>My in-law must've
rented it out really cheap.</b>

1279
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:34,666
<b>No one on that side
sells pork trotters.</b>

1280
01:04:34,690 --> 01:04:37,619
<b>I wish a pork trotter seller
would come in.</b>

1281
01:04:37,789 --> 01:04:39,335
<b>Why? To get drunk?</b>

1282
01:04:39,359 --> 01:04:41,259
<b>It's not about getting drunk.</b>

1283
01:04:41,490 --> 01:04:43,065
<b>It's about filling my belly...</b>

1284
01:04:43,089 --> 01:04:46,599
<b>and my empty heart.
I'd like to do all that.</b>

1285
01:04:46,759 --> 01:04:50,106
<b>Whatever they sell,
I hope the person is decent.</b>

1286
01:04:50,130 --> 01:04:51,116
<b>You're right.</b>

1287
01:04:51,140 --> 01:04:54,515
<b>If it's someone like Mr. Oh
who thought he was so great,</b>

1288
01:04:54,539 --> 01:04:57,285
<b>they're not welcome.
They just cause trouble...</b>

1289
01:04:57,309 --> 01:04:59,279
<b>and make our jobs harder.
I'd hate that.</b>

1290
01:04:59,809 --> 01:05:04,619
<b>I am a bit curious.
What person rented that space?</b>

1291
01:05:04,819 --> 01:05:05,880
<b>I wonder too.</b>
