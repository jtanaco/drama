<b>There might be bugs here, so I'm using this channel.</b>

<b>Hwang Deuk-gu got away again.</b>

88

<b>I failed to reconnect.</b>

89

<b>By the way, he doesn't seem to know we go disconnected from him.</b>

<b>Right.</b>

91

<b>Send Mi-na and Gwang-cheol to the address now.</b>

<b>Yes, sir.</b>

93
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,525
<b>You seem so carefree.</b>

94

<b>Choi Yong and Bong Man-cheol.</b>

95
00:07:30,567 --> 00:07:33,730
<b>One of them got shot. And the other one got a hole in his head.</b>

<b>They might as well be dead.</b>

97

<b>But they are not dead, are they?</b>

98
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:41,405
<b>Seeing how you're asking me that,</b>

99

<b>you haven't grasped the gravity of the situation.</b>

100

<b>Let's talk face to face. Do you want to come over here now?</b>

101
00:07:46,349 --> 00:07:47,550
<b>Do you think I'm crazy?</b>

102

<b>Why would I go when Deuk-gu is there? I won't put myself in danger.</b>

<b>I'm the only one left.</b>

<b>Before he eliminates me,</b>

00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:57,590
<b>I'll make my move first.</b>

106

<b>We should figure out why he's doing this.</b>

107

<b>-If you're rash-- -Instead of agreeing with me,</b>

<b>you're talking back to me.</b>

109
00:08:04,501 --> 00:08:06,295
<b>Does it mean you don't trust me?</b>

110
00:08:06,936 --> 00:08:10,595
<b>I can see that you're anxious even after you gave me this seat.</b>

111
00:08:10,773 --> 00:08:13,165
<b>Doesn't that mean you don't trust me?</b>

112
00:08:13,877 --> 00:08:15,775
<b>I'll talk to you later.</b>

113

<b>I'm sorry.</b>

<b>CLIENT</b>

<b>I like making money, but calling me at this hour is a bit unreasonable.</b>

<b>-I need you to come now. -I would like to,</b>

<b>Are you telling me you can't come?</b>

122
00:10:05,788 --> 00:10:08,615
<b>No, I'm not saying no.</b>

123

<b>I am dying to find out what you need me to do.</b>

124
00:10:12,395 --> 00:10:17,125
<b>And I think I'm at the perfect place to discuss our nature of business.</b>

125
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:20,525
<b>They are simultaneously being assholes.</b>

<b>They're meticulous and diligent.</b>

127

<b>When we take care of one problem, there pops another.</b>

128
00:10:25,008 --> 00:10:27,470
<b>That's why we must follow our instincts.</b>

129
00:10:27,477 --> 00:10:30,410
<b>If we keep evaluating the situation, we'll achieve nothing.</b>

130

<b>Can't they make a few clones of us?</b>

131

<b>-Dispatch them in every region-- -Just step on it.</b>

132
00:10:37,186 --> 00:10:42,155
<b>By the way, Chief Choi was saying that his artificial eyes have a problem, right?</b>

133
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:44,260
<b>He said it was a matter of one's perspective.</b>

134
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:47,925
<b>He meant that we should help him, so he doesn't get off track.</b>

<b>You make them sound like they are alive.</b>

136

<b>-How are his eyes any different? -Didn't I tell you to step on it?</b>

137
00:10:53,836 --> 00:10:57,135
<b>I will comply with Mi-na One's order.</b>

138
00:11:22,131 --> 00:11:25,730
<b>I am inclined to get to the bottom of my curiosity.</b>

139
00:11:25,735 --> 00:11:27,630
<b>You're making a mistake.</b>

140
00:11:27,637 --> 00:11:31,205
<b>I willingly provided safety to store your money.</b>

141

<b>But there was some money I didn't know about.</b>

142
00:11:33,876 --> 00:11:37,540
<b>Your job is to keep it safe. How dare you open it up to see the inside?</b>

143
00:11:37,547 --> 00:11:40,580
<b>-Are you screwing our deal? -Why is Chairwoman Choi's money</b>

144
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:43,080
<b>mixed with your political slush fund?</b>

145
00:11:43,086 --> 00:11:44,945
<b>Just make the delivery.</b>

146
00:11:47,056 --> 00:11:49,355
<b>Instead of backing the late chairman,</b>

<b>are you planning to support the chairwoman to run for office?</b>

<b>I am the chairwoman of Argos now.</b>

149

<b>I don't want a deal with a third party like Hwang Deuk-gu.</b>

150

<b>I showed you where my confidence lies.</b>

151
00:12:10,346 --> 00:12:16,175
<b>Please give me the chance to join hands with you, sir.</b>

152
00:12:16,853 --> 00:12:19,780
<b>Why? Are you disappointed? Because I didn't choose you?</b>

153

<b>You crazy jerk.</b>

154
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,855
<b>Don't think about interfering with the matters of Argos behind my back.</b>

155
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:29,755
<b>You're making a mistake.</b>

156
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:34,225
<b>You know, the thing is I'm way too old to think about others.</b>

157
00:12:37,874 --> 00:12:39,665
<b>Same here.</b>

158
00:12:54,957 --> 00:12:57,585
<b>Oh, my. My valuable client is here.</b>

159
00:13:01,898 --> 00:13:04,865
<b>I'm sorry, but could you press that button over there?</b>

160
00:13:15,111 --> 00:13:19,245
<b>If it weren't for your help, I would have been here all night.</b>

161
00:13:19,348 --> 00:13:21,410
<b>-Do you have a death wish? -What?</b>

162
00:13:21,417 --> 00:13:23,680
<b>This may be your last excuse alive.</b>

163
00:13:23,686 --> 00:13:25,815
<b>Choose your words carefully.</b>

164
00:13:26,189 --> 00:13:28,985
<b>Why did you ask me to come out here?</b>

165
00:13:32,094 --> 00:13:33,785
<b>Hwang Deuk-gu.</b>

166
00:13:35,264 --> 00:13:38,565
<b>-Keep talking. -I can't give away my trade secret.</b>

167
00:13:38,601 --> 00:13:41,965
<b>The important thing is that this is his hideout.</b>

168
00:13:42,371 --> 00:13:45,905
<b>And I was almost killed by that man over there.</b>

169
00:14:01,858 --> 00:14:03,815
<b>Seol Min-jun.</b>

170
00:14:05,561 --> 00:14:08,855
<b>Didn't I hit the bullseye for you?</b>

171
00:14:09,232 --> 00:14:11,095
<b>I'm worth the money, you know.</b>

172
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:12,760
<b>Not yet.</b>

173
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:14,965
<b>Explain to me how you ended up here.</b>

174
00:14:14,971 --> 00:14:17,465
<b>I didn't know I owed you explanations.</b>

175
00:14:17,707 --> 00:14:21,275
<b>You were the one who said explanations would make things dull.</b>

176
00:14:21,911 --> 00:14:23,505
<b>So what?</b>

177
00:14:24,247 --> 00:14:26,375
<b>Did you hire me</b>

178
00:14:26,983 --> 00:14:30,215
<b>to protect you from Hwang Deuk-gu?</b>

179
00:14:32,255 --> 00:14:34,045
<b>Are you good at killing people?</b>

180
00:14:34,891 --> 00:14:36,885
<b>It depends on who it is.</b>

181
00:14:36,926 --> 00:14:38,725
<b>I like that answer.</b>

182
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:40,785
<b>Do you get hurt that easily?</b>

183
00:14:41,163 --> 00:14:43,725
<b>I don't want to be concerned about your well-being.</b>

184
00:14:44,433 --> 00:14:46,795
<b>I see. This?</b>

185
00:14:46,836 --> 00:14:48,830
<b>I only got a minor injury.</b>

186
00:14:48,838 --> 00:14:51,965
<b>But other people would have been dead.</b>

187
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:57,110
<b>Despite the fact that I'm the chairwoman of my organization,</b>

188
00:14:57,113 --> 00:15:00,745
<b>most of the people in Argos fear Hwang Deuk-gu.</b>

189
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:06,415
<b>I must let them know,</b>

190
00:15:06,455 --> 00:15:09,120
<b>to survive, they must cling onto me</b>

191
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:11,155
<b>and side with me.</b>

192
00:15:11,193 --> 00:15:14,695
<b>You need an incident that will breathe fear into them?</b>

193
00:15:15,031 --> 00:15:17,355
<b>I'll handle Hwang Deuk-gu after that.</b>

194
00:15:18,034 --> 00:15:21,235
<b>Then, it's very important that you and I work well together.</b>

195
00:15:22,605 --> 00:15:24,705
<b>It sounds like we're on the same page.</b>

196
00:15:27,276 --> 00:15:28,905
<b>As for the damage,</b>

197
00:15:30,046 --> 00:15:32,575
<b>the house owner and I will take care of it.</b>

198
00:15:32,615 --> 00:15:35,315
<b>You can go. When I call you, answer it right away.</b>

199
00:15:35,885 --> 00:15:37,545
<b>Will do.</b>

200
00:15:40,222 --> 00:15:41,885
<b>By the way,</b>

201
00:15:42,792 --> 00:15:44,990
<b>he's totally out of it.</b>

202
00:15:44,994 --> 00:15:47,425
<b>Are you all right?</b>

203
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:50,225
<b>Are you okay?</b>

204
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:52,365
<b>Wake up.</b>

205
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:58,065
<b>Take good care of him. I'm leaving.</b>

206
00:16:22,498 --> 00:16:24,230
<b>Guess where I am now.</b>

207
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:26,065
<b>A good place, I presume.</b>

208
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:28,095
<b>I'm at your place.</b>

209
00:16:31,374 --> 00:16:32,835
<b>Where?</b>

210
00:17:09,812 --> 00:17:12,175
<b>-What's wrong? -Electrical currents.</b>

211
00:17:12,248 --> 00:17:14,105
<b>They are electric.</b>

212
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,355
<b>Mi-na's direct number.</b>

213
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,425
<b>MI-NA'S DIRECT NUMBER</b>

214
00:17:34,003 --> 00:17:35,430
<b>-Mi-na. -Yes, Gi-beom.</b>

215
00:17:35,438 --> 00:17:37,130
<b>I don't have time. Where are you?</b>

216
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:39,170
<b>We're at the location you told the chief.</b>

217
00:17:39,175 --> 00:17:40,670
<b>Are the victims all right?</b>

218
00:17:40,676 --> 00:17:41,840
<b>Yes, for now.</b>

219
00:17:41,844 --> 00:17:44,340
<b>But they are locked in a cage where electrical currents run.</b>

220
00:17:44,346 --> 00:17:46,180
<b>If you touch it, you'll get hurt.</b>

221
00:17:46,182 --> 00:17:50,350
<b>As a matter of fact, we're trying to figure this out with Gwang-cheol's gloves.</b>

222
00:17:50,352 --> 00:17:52,285
<b>It's not going well.</b>

223
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:56,620
<b>Tell him to go to the other side and hold it for five seconds.</b>

224
00:17:56,625 --> 00:17:57,860
<b>He'll still be in danger.</b>

225
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:00,425
<b>That's the only way we have. Just do what I say.</b>

226
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:03,195
<b>Okay. Hold on.</b>

227
00:18:03,365 --> 00:18:05,000
<b>-Gwang-cheol. -Yes.</b>

228
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,525
<b>Go to the other side and grab the cage.</b>

229
00:18:11,474 --> 00:18:13,065
<b>Like this?</b>

230
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:16,040
<b>-What's next? -The timing is the key.</b>

231
00:18:16,045 --> 00:18:20,275
<b>The moment he grabs the cage, you must break down the cage door.</b>

232
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:22,710
<b>-Okay. -I'm almost there. I'll be there soon.</b>

233
00:18:22,718 --> 00:18:24,345
<b>Okay.</b>

234
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:29,115
<b>Let's do this.</b>

235
00:18:33,062 --> 00:18:35,425
<b>One, two,</b>

236
00:18:35,564 --> 00:18:37,125
<b>three.</b>

237
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,125
<b>Mi-na!</b>

238
00:18:43,339 --> 00:18:45,065
<b>Jeez.</b>

239
00:19:01,857 --> 00:19:03,550
<b>Let's get out of here.</b>

240
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:05,325
<b>Hold on, Gwang-cheol.</b>

241
00:19:05,928 --> 00:19:09,295
<b>There might be other traps in this case. Let's wait for Gi-beom.</b>

242
00:19:09,331 --> 00:19:11,900
<b>Mi-na, don't you remember the closed factory from before?</b>

243
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:14,465
<b>If we hesitate, all of us will be dead.</b>

244
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:17,995
<b>Let's save him first.</b>

245
00:19:23,746 --> 00:19:26,245
<b>Gwang-cheol, you have a point. But...</b>

246
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:32,015
<b>What is this?</b>

247
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:30,510
<b>You did well. You managed to save someone.</b>

248
00:20:30,512 --> 00:20:33,580
<b>-If you didn't stop me there-- -Hey, Gwang-cheol.</b>

249
00:20:33,582 --> 00:20:36,310
<b>The second trap was the cage collapsing.</b>

250
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:39,450
<b>It didn't matter if we knew it or not. We should've gotten everyone out.</b>

251
00:20:39,455 --> 00:20:41,585
<b>Don't you think you were rash?</b>

252
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:44,755
<b>If you didn't rush it, no one would have been dead. Got that?</b>

253
00:20:45,628 --> 00:20:48,355
<b>How could you be damn calm all the time?</b>

254
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:51,460
<b>How much more must we think when people are dying?</b>

255
00:20:51,467 --> 00:20:53,330
<b>For you, saving at least one is important,</b>

256
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:56,095
<b>but to me, not losing even one person is important.</b>

257
00:20:57,473 --> 00:20:59,935
<b>-I won't lose anyone. -Both of you, cut it out.</b>

258
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:11,820
<b>Is this something we should fight about?</b>

259
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:13,120
<b>Are you fools?</b>

260
00:21:13,122 --> 00:21:16,190
<b>This is what those bastards want. Feeling guilty after saving a man,</b>

261
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:18,985
<b>blaming each other, and feeling worthless.</b>

262
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:22,125
<b>Why can't you break out of that cycle?</b>

263
00:21:27,002 --> 00:21:29,030
<b>He wasn't going to let anyone live, to begin with.</b>

264
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:31,470
<b>The victims or us, who went there to save them.</b>

265
00:21:31,473 --> 00:21:33,905
<b>So he set up a trap even to the end.</b>

266
00:21:34,076 --> 00:21:36,875
<b>More importantly, he doesn't know about Rugal.</b>

267
00:21:38,447 --> 00:21:40,975
<b>He was toying with me this whole time.</b>

268
00:22:05,007 --> 00:22:07,635
<b>The number you have called is not available.</b>

269
00:22:12,247 --> 00:22:13,840
<b>Why did the prosecution take the case?</b>

270
00:22:13,849 --> 00:22:16,515
<b>We transferred the survivor to the hospital right away.</b>

271
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:18,945
<b>But we have a problem.</b>

272
00:22:19,855 --> 00:22:22,585
<b>They are raiding the place to take over the entire case.</b>

273
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:24,020
<b>Send me the background information</b>

274
00:22:24,026 --> 00:22:26,360
<b>of the victims and what you have gathered so far.</b>

275
00:22:26,362 --> 00:22:29,195
<b>Check how the investigation is progressing.</b>

276
00:22:29,531 --> 00:22:31,155
<b>Okay. Thanks.</b>

277
00:22:37,206 --> 00:22:39,400
<b>Well done. I was just debriefed.</b>

278
00:22:39,408 --> 00:22:42,175
<b>Get some rest today. We'll talk tomorrow.</b>

279
00:22:43,245 --> 00:22:45,205
<b>Rest up, you two. That'd be better.</b>

280
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:52,750
<b>Tae-woong is okay, right?</b>

281
00:22:52,755 --> 00:22:54,785
<b>It was a difficult surgery.</b>

282
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:59,655
<b>I would have given up midway through it if Tae-woong couldn't handle it.</b>

283
00:22:59,828 --> 00:23:02,525
<b>All of us would have been dead if it weren't for him.</b>

284
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:05,495
<b>He was so determined.</b>

285
00:23:05,768 --> 00:23:06,900
<b>How could he endure it?</b>

286
00:23:06,902 --> 00:23:11,195
<b>He's acting standoffish because of the agreement he signed.</b>

287
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,470
<b>-What agreement? -Given his background,</b>

288
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:17,405
<b>he had to sign an agreement to promise his loyalty.</b>

289
00:23:20,082 --> 00:23:22,975
<b>I've never seen such a short and clear agreement.</b>

290
00:23:23,752 --> 00:23:27,745
<b>But I bet Tae-woong is working his ass off to follow through on that.</b>

291
00:23:42,371 --> 00:23:48,035
<b>Enter eternal paradise</b>

292
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:54,780
<b>Tae-woong, it's pretty chilly today.</b>

293
00:23:54,783 --> 00:23:56,880
<b>Make sure you bundle up.</b>

294
00:23:56,885 --> 00:23:59,785
<b>Taking my advice won't do you any harm.</b>

295
00:24:19,508 --> 00:24:21,170
<b>Han Tae-woong!</b>

296
00:24:21,176 --> 00:24:22,670
<b>-I told you to be good. -Hey!</b>

297
00:24:22,678 --> 00:24:24,310
<b>-I can't believe you stole it. -Hey!</b>

298
00:24:24,313 --> 00:24:25,840
<b>What? You do it too.</b>

299
00:24:25,848 --> 00:24:28,080
<b>Just for a little while because I have no choice.</b>

300
00:24:28,083 --> 00:24:29,945
<b>I'll pay them back later on.</b>

301
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:32,420
<b>That hurts!</b>

302
00:24:32,421 --> 00:24:34,615
<b>-Okay, fine! -What will you do?</b>

303
00:24:34,756 --> 00:24:36,585
<b>Gosh, it hurts.</b>

304
00:24:48,003 --> 00:24:49,100
<b>You can eat this too.</b>

305
00:24:49,104 --> 00:24:50,735
<b>-Really? -Yes.</b>

306
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:54,605
<b>Is it good?</b>

307
00:24:55,611 --> 00:24:57,505
<b>Eat slowly, or you'll get sick.</b>

308
00:25:05,053 --> 00:25:07,080
<b>Tae-woong, I came to pick you up.</b>

309
00:25:07,089 --> 00:25:08,920
<b>I said I didn't want to see anyone.</b>

310
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:11,920
<b>I'll be back after the 49th day memorial service.</b>

311
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:14,890
<b>I'm sorry. The higher-ups keep asking for you.</b>

312
00:25:14,897 --> 00:25:17,655
<b>Leave. Don't make me repeat myself.</b>

313
00:26:09,918 --> 00:26:11,845
<b>These people here...</b>

314
00:26:12,287 --> 00:26:14,515
<b>-Did you do this? -What if I did?</b>

315
00:26:18,293 --> 00:26:20,385
<b>They had nothing to do with it.</b>

316
00:26:21,096 --> 00:26:22,460
<b>Why did you kill them?</b>

317
00:26:22,464 --> 00:26:24,660
<b>Since when did you care about such things?</b>

318
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:27,160
<b>I said I'd return after the 49th day memorial service.</b>

319
00:26:27,169 --> 00:26:31,165
<b>Sure, your sister tipped off the police. But did she really do it alone?</b>

320
00:26:31,707 --> 00:26:33,405
<b>The police</b>

321
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:36,075
<b>used my sister</b>

322
00:26:36,712 --> 00:26:38,435
<b>and ditched her.</b>

323
00:26:38,814 --> 00:26:40,340
<b>As for all the damage,</b>

324
00:26:40,349 --> 00:26:42,215
<b>I will</b>

325
00:26:42,651 --> 00:26:44,175
<b>make up for it.</b>

326
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:50,715
<b>Now, I'm going to kill you</b>

327
00:26:52,127 --> 00:26:53,955
<b>because you ignored</b>

328
00:26:54,129 --> 00:26:55,655
<b>my warning.</b>

329
00:27:20,322 --> 00:27:24,715
<b>Did you think I came empty-handed to catch a monster like you?</b>

330
00:27:56,058 --> 00:27:58,825
<b>This is the end of</b>

331
00:27:59,695 --> 00:28:01,260
<b>Han Tae-woong, the so-called hotshot.</b>

332
00:28:01,263 --> 00:28:02,955
<b>You got that?</b>

333
00:29:21,343 --> 00:29:23,005
<b>Tae-woong!</b>

334
00:29:24,112 --> 00:29:26,005
<b>Tae-woong!</b>

335
00:29:26,114 --> 00:29:27,705
<b>Tae-woong!</b>

336
00:29:36,224 --> 00:29:38,785
<b>Tae-woong, let's go home!</b>

337
00:30:41,189 --> 00:30:43,185
<b>It's okay. You don't need to get up.</b>

338
00:30:45,126 --> 00:30:47,085
<b>Did you have a nightmare?</b>

339
00:30:47,429 --> 00:30:50,230
<b>I heard they had to cut out some parts that were totally fine</b>

340
00:30:50,232 --> 00:30:53,325
<b>to connect your wounded arm.</b>

341
00:30:53,401 --> 00:30:55,125
<b>I should and will endure this.</b>

342
00:30:55,737 --> 00:30:59,505
<b>Even if I end up getting all my limbs exchanged,</b>

343
00:31:00,575 --> 00:31:02,235
<b>I will not break my vow.</b>

344
00:31:06,715 --> 00:31:11,115
<b>It's not an exaggeration to say that Rugal was founded upon that promise.</b>

345
00:31:11,553 --> 00:31:15,655
<b>I needed a lot of time to believe that promise.</b>

346
00:31:15,824 --> 00:31:17,855
<b>Yes, of course.</b>

347
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:20,155
<b>We were enemies</b>

348
00:31:20,729 --> 00:31:22,455
<b>who were after each other.</b>

349
00:31:22,564 --> 00:31:24,125
<b>But things have changed.</b>

350
00:31:24,466 --> 00:31:27,895
<b>Now, living as a member of Rugal,</b>

351
00:31:28,803 --> 00:31:31,335
<b>as an undercover cop,</b>

352
00:31:32,641 --> 00:31:34,335
<b>and as well as working</b>

353
00:31:34,843 --> 00:31:36,305
<b>with the members</b>

354
00:31:37,779 --> 00:31:39,375
<b>makes me happy.</b>

355
00:31:44,686 --> 00:31:46,945
<b>I want to get used to</b>

356
00:31:47,589 --> 00:31:49,515
<b>a life like this.</b>

357
00:31:53,028 --> 00:31:55,355
<b>"But things have changed."</b>

358
00:31:56,364 --> 00:31:58,695
<b>And he wants to get used to this?</b>

359
00:31:59,868 --> 00:32:03,265
<b>I really want to know what that "promise" is about.</b>

360
00:32:27,662 --> 00:32:30,460
<b>You should've just waited there quietly.</b>

361
00:32:30,465 --> 00:32:32,860
<b>Where on earth have you been?</b>

362
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:35,900
<b>You said you'd do something fun with Seol Min-jun.</b>

363
00:32:35,904 --> 00:32:37,565
<b>Was that it?</b>

364
00:32:38,406 --> 00:32:39,700
<b>Let me first hear what you saw</b>

365
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:42,035
<b>and how you found it.</b>

366
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:43,670
<b>Even if you're curious, just suck it up</b>

367
00:32:43,678 --> 00:32:45,745
<b>because I won't tell you.</b>

368
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:50,875
<b>You couldn't have done it on your own. To think that there was someone else...</b>

369
00:32:50,885 --> 00:32:53,380
<b>I just can't picture it.</b>

370
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:56,015
<b>If you needed money, you should've just told me.</b>

371
00:32:56,157 --> 00:32:57,985
<b>What is this about now?</b>

372
00:32:59,527 --> 00:33:02,360
<b>Buying properties under someone else's name and collecting artworks</b>

373
00:33:02,364 --> 00:33:05,495
<b>to avoid paying taxes, all with Chairman Ko's money.</b>

374
00:33:07,369 --> 00:33:10,265
<b>I knew you were a douchebag,</b>

375
00:33:11,172 --> 00:33:14,105
<b>but you're a thief on top of that.</b>

376
00:33:17,012 --> 00:33:18,910
<b>-Are you done? -Since we're in the same boat,</b>

377
00:33:18,913 --> 00:33:20,975
<b>I'll say one more thing.</b>

378
00:33:21,016 --> 00:33:24,775
<b>A long tail is bound to be seen, and it'll lead to your downfall.</b>

379
00:33:24,986 --> 00:33:26,845
<b>So...</b>

380
00:33:27,789 --> 00:33:30,220
<b>you'd better behave yourself.</b>

381
00:33:30,225 --> 00:33:32,890
<b>I guess you feel threatened by Madame Jang.</b>

382
00:33:32,894 --> 00:33:34,090
<b>What?</b>

383
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:36,630
<b>If we're actually in the same boat,</b>

384
00:33:36,631 --> 00:33:38,960
<b>you should be encouraging me.</b>

385
00:33:38,967 --> 00:33:41,730
<b>The less competition there is, the better.</b>

386
00:33:41,736 --> 00:33:43,900
<b>Do you still need someone to watch your back?</b>

387
00:33:43,905 --> 00:33:46,665
<b>-Watch your mouth. -You'd better watch out.</b>

388
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:49,335
<b>Words are not my weapon.</b>

389
00:33:52,747 --> 00:33:55,080
<b>What did you do to Seol Min-jun?</b>

390
00:33:55,083 --> 00:33:56,310
<b>What will you do with him?</b>

391
00:33:56,317 --> 00:33:57,875
<b>Just leave him be.</b>

392
00:33:58,286 --> 00:34:00,480
<b>A dog knows when to crawl,</b>

393
00:34:00,488 --> 00:34:03,715
<b>and he will find his master.</b>

394
00:34:04,325 --> 00:34:06,555
<b>Why didn't you kill him?</b>

395
00:34:06,961 --> 00:34:10,460
<b>By any chance, is it because</b>

396
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:13,225
<b>you feel guilty about what you did to Chairman Ko?</b>

397
00:34:17,505 --> 00:34:19,970
<b>Choi Ye-won, you're so funny.</b>

398
00:34:19,974 --> 00:34:21,805
<b>"Guilty"?</b>

399
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:23,405
<b>Me?</b>

400
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:27,005
<b>You're the one who killed him.</b>

401
00:34:27,816 --> 00:34:30,845
<b>At the reservoir. Don't you remember?</b>

402
00:34:31,653 --> 00:34:33,580
<b>One, two...</b>

403
00:34:33,588 --> 00:34:35,545
<b>Bang!</b>

404
00:34:46,835 --> 00:34:49,435
<b>Choi Ye-won killed Ko Yong-deok?</b>

405
00:34:50,271 --> 00:34:53,605
<b>Do you know why that place became a popular fishing spot?</b>

406
00:34:53,775 --> 00:34:56,940
<b>It's because there's a ton of fish feed at the bottom.</b>

407
00:34:56,945 --> 00:34:58,905
<b>We should go there sometime.</b>

408
00:34:59,481 --> 00:35:01,140
<b>Who knows?</b>

409
00:35:01,149 --> 00:35:04,115
<b>Thanks to Ko Yong-deok's rotten corpse,</b>

410
00:35:04,619 --> 00:35:07,715
<b>you might be able to catch a gigantic fish.</b>

411
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,925
<b>Let go.</b>

412
00:35:14,395 --> 00:35:16,025
<b>I said, let go!</b>

413
00:35:16,064 --> 00:35:17,855
<b>How dare you...</b>

414
00:35:22,036 --> 00:35:25,100
<b>A fight between two people who used to be friends. What should I do?</b>

415
00:35:25,106 --> 00:35:26,900
<b>Shall I step out for a moment?</b>

416
00:35:26,908 --> 00:35:29,405
<b>But if I'm not here,</b>

417
00:35:29,711 --> 00:35:32,035
<b>it'll be a little dangerous.</b>

418
00:35:37,519 --> 00:35:40,985
<b>Good. Keep bickering and fighting with each other.</b>

419
00:35:41,156 --> 00:35:43,215
<b>We can't be the only ones that suffer.</b>

420
00:35:47,162 --> 00:35:48,755
<b>A reservoir...</b>

421
00:35:57,705 --> 00:36:02,535
<b>SNACKS, FISHING GEAR AND SUPPLIES</b>

422
00:36:36,477 --> 00:36:38,335
<b>You're early, sir.</b>

423
00:36:39,847 --> 00:36:41,705
<b>I told you to get some rest.</b>

424
00:36:42,083 --> 00:36:45,145
<b>I need to keep busy when I have a lot on my mind.</b>

425
00:36:46,588 --> 00:36:48,120
<b>Things will get even worse.</b>

426
00:36:48,122 --> 00:36:51,855
<b>Regardless of the reason, a civilian died.</b>

427
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:55,325
<b>I found Seol Min-jun, sir.</b>

428
00:36:56,798 --> 00:36:59,260
<b>But he's no longer the Seol Min-jun you used to know.</b>

429
00:36:59,267 --> 00:37:01,230
<b>Is he totally on their side now?</b>

430
00:37:01,236 --> 00:37:04,235
<b>Not sure yet. I haven't had a chance to find out what happened.</b>

431
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:09,270
<b>By the way, how did you find Hwang Deuk-gu's hideout?</b>

432
00:37:09,277 --> 00:37:12,810
<b>Based on Min-jun's report from your pile of confidential documents.</b>

433
00:37:12,814 --> 00:37:14,510
<b>-I knew it. -Pardon?</b>

434
00:37:14,515 --> 00:37:18,245
<b>No one can access my confidential documents.</b>

435
00:37:18,253 --> 00:37:19,980
<b>What do you mean, sir?</b>

436
00:37:19,988 --> 00:37:21,680
<b>If you didn't know,</b>

437
00:37:21,689 --> 00:37:24,620
<b>that means it wasn't intentional, so I'm relieved.</b>

438
00:37:24,626 --> 00:37:28,255
<b>You didn't know you could access them because of your artificial eyes?</b>

439
00:37:28,963 --> 00:37:30,455
<b>Not really.</b>

440
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:32,830
<b>When I was searching for information in the past,</b>

441
00:37:32,834 --> 00:37:35,370
<b>there were times when I was denied access to some information.</b>

442
00:37:35,370 --> 00:37:37,770
<b>But with this, it was so easy.</b>

443
00:37:37,772 --> 00:37:42,065
<b>So I just thought I was allowed to access your confidential documents.</b>

444
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:44,170
<b>I'm not trying to blame you.</b>

445
00:37:44,178 --> 00:37:46,640
<b>-Maybe it's an unfounded concern. -What do you mean by that?</b>

446
00:37:46,648 --> 00:37:49,410
<b>That question. Are you the one who's asking it?</b>

447
00:37:49,417 --> 00:37:51,610
<b>Or did the artificial eyes order you to do it?</b>

448
00:37:51,619 --> 00:37:53,345
<b>Of course, I...</b>

449
00:37:56,557 --> 00:37:58,285
<b>That's my concern.</b>

450
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:00,220
<b>The AI technology in those eyes</b>

451
00:38:00,228 --> 00:38:02,660
<b>can read your brainwaves and even predict your thoughts.</b>

452
00:38:02,664 --> 00:38:05,190
<b>At first, you doubt its judgment.</b>

453
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:06,400
<b>But as you begin to trust it,</b>

454
00:38:06,401 --> 00:38:09,095
<b>you start to rely on it for all decisions.</b>

455
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:15,935
<b>Did you give me the artificial eyes?</b>

456
00:38:16,144 --> 00:38:18,140
<b>Or was I given to them?</b>

457
00:38:18,146 --> 00:38:20,275
<b>It depends on how you handle them.</b>

458
00:38:20,415 --> 00:38:22,275
<b>Don't let them take over.</b>

459
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:24,975
<b>Okay.</b>

460
00:38:50,611 --> 00:38:53,340
<b>I feel like I've known you for about ten years,</b>

461
00:38:53,348 --> 00:38:56,175

<b>I didn't see everything. I just got a sneak peek.</b>

<b>I assumed you'd have criminal records</b>

<b>Still,</b>

<b>If you want to get used to this life,</b>

520

<b>That conversation earlier...</b>

521

<b>Were you eavesdropping on me?</b>

<b>We can't afford to be chatting around like this now.</b>

<b>Yes, I should.</b>

525
00:42:30,731 --> 00:42:33,495
<b>Back then, I didn't know my enemy well,</b>

526
00:42:33,768 --> 00:42:35,825
<b>and I could neither see nor prevent</b>

527
00:42:36,604 --> 00:42:38,665
<b>another tragedy that was awaiting me.</b>

528
00:43:41,669 --> 00:43:45,130
<b>All of us have stories to tell, and we somehow ended up on the same team.</b>

529

<b>At first, I thought it was just a coincidence.</b>

<b>-Here I come. -Okay.</b>

531
00:43:48,709 --> 00:43:50,475
<b>But I was wrong.</b>

532
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:53,540
<b>Wanting revenge wasn't the only common denominator.</b>

533
00:43:53,547 --> 00:43:56,575
<b>We were all connected in our hurtful stories.</b>

534

<b>-Tae-woong. -Tae-woong.</b>

535

<b>Keep going.</b>

536
00:44:08,529 --> 00:44:10,255
<b>Do it again.</b>

537
00:44:14,869 --> 00:44:16,765
<b>-You start. -Here I come.</b>

538
00:44:22,576 --> 00:44:26,105
<b>It used to be known as Argos' place of execution.</b>

539
00:44:26,147 --> 00:44:27,605
<b>I'm aware.</b>

540
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:30,450
<b>Assistant Inspector Mun and Officer Kim died there.</b>

541
00:44:30,451 --> 00:44:33,750
<b>We found out about the place thanks to Tae-woong.</b>

542
00:44:33,754 --> 00:44:35,550
<b>And that's how we were able to save Mi-na.</b>

543
00:44:35,556 --> 00:44:37,450
<b>It looks like it became a fishing spot</b>

544
00:44:37,458 --> 00:44:38,750
<b>after it got exposed.</b>

545
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:40,320
<b>The execution ritual is gone too.</b>

546
00:44:40,327 --> 00:44:43,130
<b>By the way, did the car accident that killed Ko Yong-deok</b>

547
00:44:43,130 --> 00:44:45,755
<b>take place somewhere around the reservoir?</b>

548
00:44:47,735 --> 00:44:51,365
<b>Yes, it's 30 minutes away by car.</b>

549
00:44:57,144 --> 00:44:58,940
<b>-What are you doing? -Hey.</b>

550
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:01,080
<b>-There's an interesting piece of intel. -What is it?</b>

551
00:45:01,082 --> 00:45:03,950
<b>I have evidence that Choi Ye-won and Hwang Deuk-gu</b>

552
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:06,150
<b>killed Ko Yong-deok together.</b>

553
00:45:06,153 --> 00:45:07,750
<b>How did you find out?</b>

554
00:45:07,755 --> 00:45:09,445
<b>I planted a bug.</b>

555
00:45:10,057 --> 00:45:12,715
<b>Did that come out of your one-on-one with Choi Ye-won?</b>

556
00:45:13,427 --> 00:45:15,060
<b>Since she's the leader now,</b>

557
00:45:15,062 --> 00:45:19,325
<b>she says many things that can be very useful to us.</b>

558
00:45:22,169 --> 00:45:23,530
<b>So?</b>

559
00:45:23,537 --> 00:45:24,965
<b>What's next?</b>

560
00:45:26,407 --> 00:45:28,570
<b>I think the best way to weaken them</b>

561
00:45:28,576 --> 00:45:31,910
<b>would be using the distrust among them.</b>

562
00:45:31,912 --> 00:45:35,005
<b>The same goes for Hwang Deuk-gu, who thinks he's the boss.</b>

563
00:45:35,483 --> 00:45:37,215
<b>Gi-beom.</b>

564
00:45:37,618 --> 00:45:41,145
<b>Do you think driving a wedge between them is enough to destroy Argos?</b>

565
00:45:41,155 --> 00:45:43,915
<b>Let's not worry about weakening them first.</b>

566
00:45:44,925 --> 00:45:46,920
<b>Let's just do what we do and whack them.</b>

567
00:45:46,927 --> 00:45:48,985
<b>No, we need a strategy.</b>

568
00:45:49,296 --> 00:45:52,360
<b>We need to soften them up and destroy them inside and out.</b>

569
00:45:52,366 --> 00:45:54,565
<b>Only then can we say our mission succeeded.</b>

570
00:45:55,736 --> 00:45:58,670
<b>We all had to pay the price to join Rugal.</b>

571
00:45:58,672 --> 00:46:01,365
<b>As you know, it was quite cruel.</b>

572
00:46:01,809 --> 00:46:03,575
<b>Just whacking them</b>

573
00:46:03,811 --> 00:46:05,810
<b>wouldn't be a true revenge.</b>

574
00:46:05,813 --> 00:46:09,650
<b>Isn't destroying them to the root the real revenge?</b>

575
00:46:09,650 --> 00:46:13,285
<b>Everyone here wants to destroy them</b>

576
00:46:13,521 --> 00:46:15,350
<b>as much as you do.</b>

577
00:46:15,356 --> 00:46:17,255
<b>Go find out.</b>

578
00:46:17,391 --> 00:46:19,615
<b>Trust those eyes' intelligence capabilities</b>

579
00:46:19,693 --> 00:46:21,785
<b>and your judgment.</b>

580
00:46:22,129 --> 00:46:23,960
<b>-Give it a shot. -Sir.</b>

581
00:46:23,964 --> 00:46:27,060
<b>Sir, you were the one who was concerned about the dangers</b>

582
00:46:27,067 --> 00:46:28,460
<b>Gi-beom's eyes could pose.</b>

583
00:46:28,469 --> 00:46:30,500
<b>Let's test them</b>

584
00:46:30,504 --> 00:46:32,600
<b>to see how dangerous they could be.</b>

585
00:46:32,606 --> 00:46:34,735
<b>He's saying he's confident.</b>

586
00:46:35,142 --> 00:46:36,540
<b>Try it.</b>

587
00:46:36,544 --> 00:46:39,905
<b>I'm giving you a chance, so you'll have to deliver results.</b>

588
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:41,475
<b>Yes, sir.</b>

589
00:46:44,518 --> 00:46:46,275
<b>Good luck.</b>

590
00:46:50,891 --> 00:46:52,885
<b>You got this chance,</b>

591
00:46:53,027 --> 00:46:54,955
<b>so do a wicked job.</b>

592
00:46:55,563 --> 00:46:57,125
<b>All right.</b>

593
00:47:17,785 --> 00:47:19,445
<b>Are you asleep?</b>

594
00:47:19,954 --> 00:47:22,650
<b>-Jeez. -I was just teasing you.</b>

595
00:47:22,656 --> 00:47:23,890
<b>I was doing some thinking.</b>

596
00:47:23,891 --> 00:47:25,915
<b>About what?</b>

597
00:47:26,193 --> 00:47:28,560
<b>I was thinking, "We can buy fish at grocery stores.</b>

598
00:47:28,562 --> 00:47:32,090
<b>Why bother doing all this just catch fish?"</b>

599
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:34,025
<b>Is this your first time?</b>

600
00:47:34,735 --> 00:47:39,535
<b>I actually have years of experience.</b>

601
00:47:40,608 --> 00:47:42,300
<b>I loved to go fishing,</b>

602
00:47:42,309 --> 00:47:44,570
<b>but I was never able to as a cop.</b>

603
00:47:44,578 --> 00:47:46,910
<b>It would've been nice if it were for fun,</b>

604
00:47:46,914 --> 00:47:49,345
<b>but I came here to get an earful.</b>

605
00:47:49,383 --> 00:47:51,815
<b>-To be scolded? -Yes.</b>

606
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:55,615
<b>I was a bit of a troublemaker as a boy, you see.</b>

607
00:47:55,856 --> 00:47:58,250
<b>It's why my father would often take me fishing.</b>

608
00:47:58,259 --> 00:48:00,660
<b>I couldn't focus and was all over the place,</b>

609
00:48:00,661 --> 00:48:03,330
<b>so it was his way of calming me down.</b>

610
00:48:03,330 --> 00:48:07,295
<b>But I was too young to know that.</b>

611
00:48:07,668 --> 00:48:10,170
<b>I thought he was trying to get rid of me instead,</b>

612
00:48:10,170 --> 00:48:12,270
<b>so I obeyed him from there on out.</b>

613
00:48:12,273 --> 00:48:15,300
<b>Kids are meant to cause trouble though.</b>

614
00:48:15,309 --> 00:48:18,205
<b>There was no need to say it in such a serious manner.</b>

615
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:22,950
<b>Hold on. Is this lake appropriate for scuba-diving?</b>

616
00:48:22,950 --> 00:48:26,280

622
00:48:53,714 --> 00:48:55,605
<b>It doesn't seem occupied.</b>

623

<b>Is anybody here?</b>

624
00:49:08,662 --> 00:49:10,225
<b>What's this?</b>

625
00:49:11,065 --> 00:49:14,195

<b>Are you going to enter?</b>

627
00:49:16,704 --> 00:49:18,865
<b>Well, we might get a lead.</b>

628

633
00:50:05,552 --> 00:50:07,245
<b>Shit.</b>

634
00:50:07,488 --> 00:50:10,155
<b>It seems like the owner is out making a deal.</b>

635

<b>The valuables don't seem like they belong to one person though.</b>

<b>From dead bodies.</b>

638
00:50:20,734 --> 00:50:22,665
<b>What?</b>

639
00:50:23,570 --> 00:50:26,135

<b>Hold on. What are these?</b>

641
00:50:34,882 --> 00:50:37,710
<b>How frugal of him.</b>

642
00:50:37,718 --> 00:50:41,050
<b>He's breathing in liquid nicotine to save money on cigarettes.</b>

643
00:50:41,055 --> 00:50:43,285

<b>Then how do you explain what I saw?</b>

655

<b>It could've been a coincidence</b>

<b>Finally, you have a job to do.</b>

665

<b>By the way, doctor,</b>

666
00:52:24,424 --> 00:52:26,785

<b>Don't think that real fights only happen in the field.</b>
