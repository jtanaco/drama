<b>Seriously, not at all.</b>

229

<b>Yes, that sounds better.</b>

238
00:25:28,141 --> 00:25:29,151
<b>Yes.</b>

239
00:25:35,891 --> 00:25:38,351
<b>Hi, Eun Sil. How are you?</b>

240
00:25:38,352 --> 00:25:41,121
<b>Where are you going? Do you want a ride?</b>

241
00:25:41,122 --> 00:25:42,460
<b>Where can you drop me off?</b>

<b>I can drive you all the way to Gangneung.</b>

<b>What are you talking about? You don't even have a car.</b>

244
00:25:45,632 --> 00:25:46,731
<b>I do.</b>

245
00:25:46,802 --> 00:25:48,331
<b>- It's my dad's.
- Really?</b>

<b>- Let's go.
- Okay.</b>

<b>- Where's the car?

- All right. Here.</b>

250
00:25:55,812 --> 00:25:58,171
<b>It's for you. On my way here...</b>

251
00:26:02,411 --> 00:26:04,311
<b>What? Is something wrong?</b>

252
00:26:04,312 --> 00:26:06,351
<b>You don't blush so much anymore.</b>

253
00:26:06,352 --> 00:26:07,781
<b>- What are you talking about?
- I mean your face.</b>

254
00:26:07,782 --> 00:26:09,291
<b>Before, whenever you saw me,</b>

255
00:26:09,292 --> 00:26:10,851
<b>your face would automatically turn red.</b>

256
00:26:10,852 --> 00:26:11,951
<b>But now...</b>

257
00:26:14,522 --> 00:26:15,961
<b>You're blushing again.</b>

258
00:26:19,632 --> 00:26:21,031
<b>All right. Let's go.</b>

259
00:26:21,032 --> 00:26:22,201
<b>So where's your car?</b>

260
00:26:23,001 --> 00:26:24,572
<b>What are you eating?</b>

261
00:26:25,171 --> 00:26:26,171
<b>Rice cakes.</b>

262

<b>It's from the rice cake festival. They're so tasty.</b>

263
00:26:28,602 --> 00:26:30,140
<b>You carry rice cakes in your pocket?</b>

264
00:26:30,141 --> 00:26:32,012
<b>I couldn't tie them to my ankle, could I?</b>

265
00:26:32,082 --> 00:26:33,882
<b>- Do you want some?
- No, thanks.</b>

266
00:26:34,282 --> 00:26:36,180
<b>Is it okay if we stop at a rest area...</b>

267
00:26:36,181 --> 00:26:38,111
<b>and get something to eat later?</b>

268
00:26:38,112 --> 00:26:40,121
<b>I didn't have breakfast.</b>

269
00:26:40,122 --> 00:26:41,921
<b>Mom kicked me out.</b>

270
00:26:42,322 --> 00:26:43,990
<b>Sure, I'll buy you some food.</b>

271
00:26:43,991 --> 00:26:46,121
<b>Thanks. Let's go. Where's your car?</b>

272
00:26:46,122 --> 00:26:47,461
<b>Over there.</b>

273
00:26:50,931 --> 00:26:53,101
<b>By the way, I heard...</b>

274
00:26:53,102 --> 00:26:55,571
<b>you broke up with your boyfriend.</b>

275
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:56,572
<b>Yes.</b>

276
00:26:57,401 --> 00:27:00,640
<b>How does everyone know? They all asked me that.</b>

277
00:27:00,641 --> 00:27:03,971
<b>Did someone post on the internet that I broke up?</b>

278
00:27:04,072 --> 00:27:07,311
<b>It feels like there's a sign up somewhere. Everyone knows.</b>

279
00:27:07,312 --> 00:27:10,410
<b>Well, my mom wants me to get married early.</b>

<b>She wants to see a grandchild.</b>

281

- Tell you what?</b>

<b>What do you want to do?</b>

283
00:27:26,496 --> 00:27:28,036
<b>I can go inside.</b>

284
00:27:35,576 --> 00:27:36,576
<b>Then...</b>

285
00:27:38,707 --> 00:27:41,046
<b>- Will you...
- I'll have to ask her.</b>

286
00:27:44,316 --> 00:27:45,657
<b>I'll ask her.</b>

287

<b>why she didn't tell me.</b>

289

<b>I'm really sorry, Hae Won.</b>

319

<b>Why did you hide it from me?</b>

320
00:31:47,326 --> 00:31:48,697
<b>Why only me?</b>

321
00:31:51,667 --> 00:31:53,337
<b>It would've hurt you too much.</b>

322

<b>But if you found out,</b>

326
00:32:08,117 --> 00:32:09,647
<b>it would hurt you too much.</b>

327

<b>- Why tell me now?
- Since I'll turn myself in now.</b>

330
00:32:19,627 --> 00:32:20,627
<b>What?</b>

331
00:32:26,437 --> 00:32:29,637
<b>I deserve to be punished for what I did.</b>

332
00:32:37,347 --> 00:32:38,377
<b>I...</b>

333
00:32:38,947 --> 00:32:41,917
<b>really didn't want to write novels.</b>

334
00:32:43,246 --> 00:32:46,187
<b>But it was so hard to make a living.</b>

335
00:32:47,756 --> 00:32:49,457
<b>Not for me, but for you.</b>

336
00:32:51,457 --> 00:32:53,795
<b>I had to make some money at least...</b>

<b>for you to live comfortably.</b>

338
00:32:56,796 --> 00:33:00,097
<b>That's why I decided to write one last novel, and that's when...</b>

339
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:04,136
<b>Cha Yun Taek told me to write something about my life.</b>

340
00:33:04,137 --> 00:33:05,667
<b>So I thought this was my chance.</b>

<b>and being blamed by the public,</b>

346
00:33:23,286 --> 00:33:24,886
<b>I wanted to turn myself in.</b>

<b>Auntie, wake up!</b>

362

<b>Why...</b>

<b>I never asked, did I?</b>

369

<b>That's why seeing you come here so unexpectedly like this...</b>

<b>I went to the noodle place with my colleagues...</b>

<b>So I brought you to my place.</b>

<b>Why did you drink so much?</b>

<b>I liked you too.</b>

<b>I did.</b>

403

<b>That's why I was hurt by what you did.</b>

404

<b>everything I had to endure back then...</b>

408

<b>was caused by you,</b>

409

<b>so it wasn't easy for me to forgive you.</b>

410

<b>What's wrong with a little crack?</b>

- I can't believe those punks.</b>

<b>Corporal Kim.</b>

474
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:52,319
<b>- Hello, ma'am.
- What's going on here?</b>

475
00:44:52,750 --> 00:44:55,189
<b>There's been a report...</b>

476
00:44:55,190 --> 00:44:57,959
<b>of a naked party at the guesthouse in the back.</b>

477
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:00,128
<b>And those punks ran that way.</b>

478
00:45:00,129 --> 00:45:01,159
<b>What?</b>

479
00:45:02,060 --> 00:45:04,269
<b>Excuse me, what were you saying before?</b>

480
00:45:04,270 --> 00:45:05,400
<b>Nothing.</b>

481
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:10,810
<b>- At the guesthouse?
- Yes.</b>

482
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:13,479
<b>That explains all the noise.</b>

483
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:15,310
<b>- Did you talk to the owner?
- Yes.</b>

484
00:45:15,739 --> 00:45:17,108
<b>- Make sure it never happens again.
- Okay.</b>

485
00:45:17,109 --> 00:45:18,980
<b>- Thank you.
- See you.</b>

486
00:45:43,810 --> 00:45:46,379
<b>Did you think I was already turning myself in...</b>

487
00:45:47,379 --> 00:45:49,040
<b>and panic or something?</b>

488
00:45:54,379 --> 00:45:56,390
<b>Why do you keep that picture there?</b>

489
00:45:58,890 --> 00:46:01,089
<b>It wasn't there when I lived here.</b>

490
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:05,060
<b>It was definitely not there when Grandma was still alive.</b>

491
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:08,359
<b>You haven't been back here...</b>

492

493
00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:14,870
<b>I miss her.</b>

494
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:23,509
<b>Auntie.</b>

495
00:46:24,609 --> 00:46:25,679
<b>Say it.</b>

496
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:29,179
<b>I kind of hate you.</b>

497
00:46:31,890 --> 00:46:32,890
<b>I get that.</b>

498
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:35,960
<b>You didn't want me to suffer.</b>

499
00:46:37,859 --> 00:46:41,258
<b>I thought hearing you say that would make me understand you,</b>

500
00:46:41,259 --> 00:46:42,400
<b>but it didn't.</b>

501
00:46:43,029 --> 00:46:45,129
<b>I still can't understand you.</b>

502
00:46:47,270 --> 00:46:48,339
<b>Why not?</b>

503
00:46:52,710 --> 00:46:54,179
<b>I believe...</b>

504
00:46:57,909 --> 00:47:00,879
<b>families should share their pain with each other.</b>

505
00:47:05,219 --> 00:47:07,159
<b>Let's share our pain.</b>

506
00:47:09,259 --> 00:47:10,589
<b>Don't turn yourself in.</b>

507
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:17,400
<b>If you've hung in there for the past 10 years for Mom,</b>

508
00:47:17,830 --> 00:47:20,169
<b>hang in there for the next 10 years for me.</b>

509
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:22,699
<b>- Hae Won.
- You once told me...</b>

510
00:47:23,670 --> 00:47:25,539
<b>if I died, so would you,</b>

511
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:28,009
<b>Mom, and Grandma.</b>

512
00:47:30,150 --> 00:47:32,150
<b>Back then, I was living in a nightmare too.</b>

513
00:47:32,650 --> 00:47:35,218
<b>Even though the incident didn't involve me directly,</b>

514
00:47:35,219 --> 00:47:37,250
<b>it was still a nightmare for me too.</b>

515
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:41,790
<b>If you turn yourself in now,</b>

516
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:45,230
<b>I'll be living in a nightmare again.</b>

517
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:52,870
<b>So just continue living the way you've been living.</b>

518
00:47:55,739 --> 00:47:56,770
<b>But...</b>

519
00:47:57,839 --> 00:48:00,609
<b>I don't think I can look at you the same way anymore.</b>

520
00:48:02,239 --> 00:48:03,650
<b>I need some time...</b>

521
00:48:07,819 --> 00:48:10,150

522
00:48:18,929 --> 00:48:20,460

524
00:48:29,270 --> 00:48:31,069

<b>Can we talk for a second?</b>

527
00:49:52,790 --> 00:49:53,790
<b>Of course.</b>

528
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:08,640
<b>Do you want some coffee?</b>

529
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:19,210
<b>Are you okay?</b>

530
00:50:28,819 --> 00:50:31,560
<b>Auntie wanted to turn herself in,</b>

531
00:50:34,730 --> 00:50:36,670
<b>and I told her not to.</b>

532
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,299
<b>I see.</b>

533
00:50:44,009 --> 00:50:45,140
<b>The thing is,</b>

534
00:50:48,009 --> 00:50:51,650
<b>I can't look Auntie in the eye anymore.</b>

535

<b>You know that, right?</b>

544
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:04,420
<b>Well...</b>

545
00:52:04,989 --> 00:52:07,020
<b>Take care, Eun Seop.</b>
