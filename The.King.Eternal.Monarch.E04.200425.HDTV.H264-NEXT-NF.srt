3
00:01:20,433 --> 00:01:21,642
<b>Here's your iced tea latte.</b>

4
00:01:21,726 --> 00:01:23,353
<b>Thank you. Latte...</b>

5
00:01:24,687 --> 00:01:25,646
<b>Hot.</b>

6
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:27,940
<b>What the...</b>

7
00:01:28,024 --> 00:01:29,317
<b>Why is the iced drink so hot?</b>

8
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,860
<b>You are a piece of work.</b>

9
00:01:31,069 --> 00:01:32,111
<b>Are you still drunk?</b>

10
00:01:32,195 --> 00:01:33,738
<b>But it was really hot just now.</b>

11
00:01:37,075 --> 00:01:38,159
<b>My gosh.</b>

12
00:01:38,326 --> 00:01:39,202
<b>Are you okay, sir?</b>

13
00:01:39,285 --> 00:01:42,872
<b>I don't understand why guys
from the southern region like this stuff.</b>

14
00:01:42,955 --> 00:01:45,917
<b>How are you supposed to drink
something so hot?</b>

15
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,877
<b>Next time, I'll make the coffee for you.</b>

16
00:01:49,128 --> 00:01:51,881
<b>I should at least know
how to make my own cup of coffee.</b>

17
00:01:51,964 --> 00:01:53,216
<b>It's okay. I'll do it.</b>

18
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:55,426
<b>Sir?</b>

19

<b>Prime Minister Koo has arrived

<b>Today's Friday?</b>

21
00:02:01,724 --> 00:02:02,725
<b>I can't believe this.</b>

22
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:06,062
<b>-Sir?
-What?</b>

23
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:14,237
<b>I'm listening.</b>

24

<i><b>finally met you,</i></b>

28

<i><b>Where are you going?</i></b>

29
00:02:38,386 --> 00:02:39,262
<b>Back to my world.</b>

30
00:02:39,887 --> 00:02:42,974
<b>I'm the King of my country.
I left the palace empty for too long.</b>

31
00:02:44,934 --> 00:02:46,894
<i><b>It's not that I didn't know
how to go back.</i></b>

32
00:02:47,645 --> 00:02:49,188
<i><b>I just didn't want to go.</i></b>

33
00:02:49,856 --> 00:02:51,732
<i><b>So, this is a parallel world?</i></b>

34
00:02:52,358 --> 00:02:53,443
<i><b>Prove it.</i></b>

35
00:02:53,943 --> 00:02:55,611
<b>The proof is right in front of you.</b>

<b>Evidence that points

<b>CASE SUMMARY</b>

44
00:03:29,395 --> 00:03:30,980
<i><b>Why did you become a detective?</i></b>

45
00:03:32,023 --> 00:03:34,358
<b>I was born into my profession.</b>

46
00:03:34,817 --> 00:03:35,735
<b>The King.</b>

47
00:03:36,652 --> 00:03:39,614
<b>I am curious as to how others
grow to have aspirations.</b>

48
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:43,284
<b>You know that sounds cocky, right?</b>

49
00:03:43,868 --> 00:03:45,203
<b>It may be,</b>

50
00:03:46,037 --> 00:03:48,831
<b>but I go through things that
others don't go through because of this.</b>

51
00:03:51,709 --> 00:03:52,752
<b>When I was little,</b>

52
00:03:54,212 --> 00:03:57,340
<b>I watched <i>The Police</i> with my dad</b>

53
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,343
<b>while other girls watched
<i>Snow White</i> and <i>The Little Mermaid</i>.</b>

54
00:04:01,093 --> 00:04:03,638
<b>By eight-years-old, I could tell
who the criminal was on the show.</b>

55
00:04:03,721 --> 00:04:05,223
<b>So, it was your talent.</b>

56
00:04:06,057 --> 00:04:07,642
<b>No. It's the reruns.</b>

57
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,063
<b>As I kept watching the show,
I wanted to be a cop.</b>

58
00:04:13,189 --> 00:04:15,149
<b>It's dangerous to be a cop.</b>

59
00:04:16,734 --> 00:04:17,818
<b>I know.</b>

60
00:04:18,444 --> 00:04:21,489
<b>Not everyone in the world can be brave.</b>

61
00:04:22,073 --> 00:04:23,533
<b>So I decided to become brave.</b>

62
00:04:35,753 --> 00:04:38,464
<b>That's cool, Lieutenant Jeong Tae-eul.</b>

63
00:04:41,175 --> 00:04:42,260
<b>So that's my story.</b>

64
00:04:44,053 --> 00:04:45,846
<b>Tell me what kind of a King
Kim Gae-ddong is.</b>

65
00:04:47,974 --> 00:04:49,058
<b>A young,</b>

66
00:04:50,393 --> 00:04:52,603
<b>handsome, and rich King?</b>

67
00:04:55,481 --> 00:05:00,736
<b>A rower, a mathematician,
a well-grown orphan,</b>

68
00:05:03,823 --> 00:05:05,658
<b>and the owner of the Four Tiger Sword.</b>

69
00:05:07,868 --> 00:05:10,371
<b>The kind of King who has
never been asked such a question</b>

70
00:05:11,706 --> 00:05:12,999
<b>and is trying his best</b>

71
00:05:14,542 --> 00:05:15,501
<b>not to panic.</b>

72
00:05:18,963 --> 00:05:21,841
<b>Evidence that points
to another evidence...</b>

73
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:27,263
<b>Evidence that points
to another evidence...</b>

74
00:05:31,934 --> 00:05:33,728
<b>-Prime Minister Koo.
-Yes, I know.</b>

75
00:05:35,354 --> 00:05:36,355
<b>Hurry up.</b>

76
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:39,233
<b>I know they asked you
to buy time but make it quick.</b>

77
00:05:39,859 --> 00:05:41,652
<b>She's unbelievable.</b>

78
00:05:41,736 --> 00:05:44,572
<b>Does she think the palace
is some kind of a supermarket?</b>

79
00:05:45,072 --> 00:05:48,284
<b>The security team tried to buy time,
but it didn't really work.</b>

80
00:05:48,576 --> 00:05:50,536
<b>What did she say she's here for?</b>

81
00:05:50,953 --> 00:05:53,664
<b>I'm here to report to His Majesty
regarding national affairs.</b>

82
00:05:57,543 --> 00:05:59,754
<b>We asked everyone
to send in a written report</b>

83
00:06:00,087 --> 00:06:02,423
<b>unless it's regarding
a national emergency.</b>

84
00:06:02,506 --> 00:06:05,051
<b>And everyone already agreed to that.</b>

85
00:06:05,134 --> 00:06:07,386
<b>You can't just barge in here like this.</b>

86
00:06:08,971 --> 00:06:11,474
<b>Do you want us to make it harder
for people to visit the palace?</b>

87
00:06:11,682 --> 00:06:14,977
<b>Or do you just need us to teach you
the rules all over again?</b>

88
00:06:15,561 --> 00:06:17,813
<b>Why don't you take a step back?</b>

89
00:06:18,481 --> 00:06:19,940
<b>His Majesty is gone, isn't he?</b>

90
00:06:21,067 --> 00:06:23,861
<b>I'd call that a national emergency.</b>

91
00:06:24,528 --> 00:06:26,280
<b>I won't turn a blind eye to this.</b>

92
00:06:26,364 --> 00:06:30,159
<b>And I won't let you hide it either
regardless of your position in the palace.</b>

93
00:06:31,285 --> 00:06:34,455
<b>His Majesty stayed in his study
all day long.</b>

94
00:06:34,538 --> 00:06:36,666
<b>And he went to bed early today.</b>

95
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:41,253
<b>-I guess I should've gone to his bedroom.
-You're crossing the line!</b>

96
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:44,465
<b>You're just a government official
who will be replaced in five years.</b>

97
00:06:44,548 --> 00:06:46,509
<b>Don't get too ahead of yourself.</b>

98
00:06:46,592 --> 00:06:48,386
<b>I haven't crossed the line yet.</b>

99
00:06:49,553 --> 00:06:52,515
<b>Tell His Majesty
that I'll be waiting in his office.</b>

100
00:06:53,808 --> 00:06:55,559
<b>-Please move aside.
-Stay right there!</b>

101
00:06:56,352 --> 00:06:59,689
<b>I won't take a single step
from where I'm standing now.</b>

102
00:06:59,772 --> 00:07:01,816
<b>Then that's going to cause some trouble.</b>

103
00:07:02,024 --> 00:07:05,903
<b>His Majesty is the only person
who has the right to stop me.</b>

104
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:08,072
<b>And I'm a lot stronger than you.</b>

105
00:07:13,285 --> 00:07:15,079
<b>Ma'am!</b>

106
00:07:15,162 --> 00:07:16,205
<b>How dare she...</b>

107
00:07:23,087 --> 00:07:26,298
<b>Didn't I tell everyone to send me
written reports this week?</b>

108
00:07:27,842 --> 00:07:28,801
<b>Yes, Your Majesty.</b>

109
00:07:30,386 --> 00:07:34,056
<b>I told her so,
but she just barged in anyway.</b>

110
00:07:36,058 --> 00:07:40,354
<b>Since you're up, why don't you
just check what she has to report?</b>

111
00:07:41,188 --> 00:07:42,440
<b>Okay, then.</b>

112
00:07:43,315 --> 00:07:44,358
<b>Will you please excuse us?</b>

113
00:07:56,537 --> 00:07:59,373
<b>I was busy trying to solve a puzzle
that has perplexed me for a long time.</b>

114
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:01,667
<b>I'm sorry for worrying you.</b>

115
00:08:02,251 --> 00:08:03,461
<b>I made you work until so late.</b>

116
00:08:04,044 --> 00:08:05,171
<b>That just comes with the job.</b>

117
00:08:05,838 --> 00:08:07,173
<b>Did you solve the puzzle?</b>

118
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:09,341
<b>I was horrible at math,
so my answers were always</b>

119
00:08:09,425 --> 00:08:13,512
<b>either zero or minus one
whenever I didn't know the answer.</b>

120
00:08:14,305 --> 00:08:15,264
<b>That's interesting.</b>

121
00:08:15,848 --> 00:08:16,724
<b>My answer</b>

122
00:08:17,767 --> 00:08:18,601
<b>was zero as well.</b>

123
00:08:20,394 --> 00:08:21,270
<b>Lucky you.</b>

124
00:08:22,146 --> 00:08:24,315
<b>My answer turned out to be incorrect.</b>

125
00:08:25,941 --> 00:08:26,901
<b>By the way,</b>

126
00:08:27,443 --> 00:08:28,611
<b>you're a bit tan.</b>

127
00:08:29,612 --> 00:08:31,280
<b>I thought you stayed in your study.</b>

128
00:08:31,363 --> 00:08:32,656
<b>Really?</b>

129
00:08:33,532 --> 00:08:35,367
<b>The study is in Gwangyeongjeon.</b>

130
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:39,538
<b>It gets lots of sunlight during the day,
and it's covered with stars at night.</b>

131
00:08:40,831 --> 00:08:44,794
<b>It looks like my grandfather
spent a fortune building that place.</b>

132
00:08:49,131 --> 00:08:51,801
<b>I haven't been able to laugh
due to all the problematic issues.</b>

133
00:08:52,802 --> 00:08:54,637
<b>I'm not really here to report anything.</b>

134
00:08:55,179 --> 00:08:57,389
<b>I just came to see if you were missing.</b>

135
00:08:57,598 --> 00:08:59,141
<b>And I'm glad I came.</b>

136
00:09:03,979 --> 00:09:05,189
<b>You're indebted</b>

137
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,691
<b>to me now, Your Majesty.</b>

138
00:09:10,402 --> 00:09:11,904
<b>Good luck with solving this one.</b>

139
00:09:13,322 --> 00:09:14,448
<b>I'll see you next week.</b>

140
00:09:18,452 --> 00:09:19,537
<b>Prime Minister Koo.</b>

141
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,043
<b>Let me tell you something.</b>

142
00:09:27,044 --> 00:09:28,504
<b>I didn't want to offend you,</b>

143
00:09:29,797 --> 00:09:31,048
<b>but this won't sound pleasant.</b>

144
00:09:34,468 --> 00:09:38,222
<b>Every moment of my life
is the history of the Kingdom of Corea.</b>

145
00:09:38,556 --> 00:09:41,684
<b>And I want that history to last forever</b>

146
00:09:43,435 --> 00:09:44,937
<b>because I am the King of this country.</b>

147
00:09:46,021 --> 00:09:47,314
<b>But that will require</b>

148
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,234
<b>more than just my benevolence.</b>

149
00:09:52,361 --> 00:09:53,279
<b>Therefore,</b>

150
00:09:54,488 --> 00:09:55,948
<b>I can never be indebted to you.</b>

151
00:09:57,366 --> 00:09:59,952
<b>Let's wait and see how my absence
will be recorded</b>

152
00:10:00,035 --> 00:10:01,453
<b>in the pages of history books.</b>

153
00:10:02,454 --> 00:10:03,747
<b>Do you understand?</b>

154
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:07,877
<b>I'll see you next week.</b>

00:19:45,328 --> 00:19:47,581
<b>She is lucky that I'm a nice person.</b>

308
00:19:47,664 --> 00:19:49,875
<b>If I weren't,
I would have robbed her first.</b>

309
00:19:56,715 --> 00:19:58,300
<b>How long have you been working here?</b>

310
00:19:59,342 --> 00:20:00,969
<b>Are you suspecting me?</b>

311
00:20:01,678 --> 00:20:04,139
<b>I have been working here
for less than a month now.</b>

312
00:20:04,222 --> 00:20:06,099
<b>Do you know the phone number
of the person who worked before you?</b>

313
00:20:06,183 --> 00:20:09,686
<b>The culprit knew where the victim
was going to be, how much she would have,</b>

314
00:20:09,769 --> 00:20:11,480
<b>and even the blind spots of the CCTV.</b>

315
00:20:11,563 --> 00:20:13,231
<b>Right. I see.</b>

316
00:20:13,356 --> 00:20:16,401
<b>Hang on a second.
I have her number because of the handover.</b>

317
00:20:18,904 --> 00:20:20,572
<b>There it is. Here.</b>

318
00:20:27,954 --> 00:20:30,081
<b>Her number is found
on the online secondhand market.</b>

319
00:20:30,165 --> 00:20:32,042
<b>She's selling a red wallet.</b>

320
00:20:38,006 --> 00:20:40,008
<b>Tae-eul, do you need a wallet?</b>

321
00:20:40,884 --> 00:20:42,135
<b>How about we buy it in person?</b>

322
00:20:44,471 --> 00:20:45,347
<b>Excuse me.</b>

323
00:20:46,264 --> 00:20:47,265
<b>Are you buying the wallet?</b>

324
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:49,100
<b>Oh, right.</b>

325
00:20:50,185 --> 00:20:53,396
<b>Can I see the wallet first?</b>

326
00:20:56,733 --> 00:20:59,152
<b>Oh, my. It's pretty.</b>

327
00:20:59,361 --> 00:21:00,654
<b>It's almost brand new.</b>

328
00:21:00,737 --> 00:21:02,197
<b>I only unpacked it and didn't use it.</b>

329
00:21:02,781 --> 00:21:03,949
<b>I see.</b>

330
00:21:04,032 --> 00:21:07,744
<b>I would have asked for a refund,
but I lost the receipt.</b>

331
00:21:08,578 --> 00:21:10,163
<b>Will you wire me the money?</b>

332
00:21:12,832 --> 00:21:14,668
<b>I think I will arrest you.</b>

333
00:21:15,252 --> 00:21:16,294
<b>Ms. Kim Su-jin?</b>

334
00:21:17,087 --> 00:21:20,674
<b>Where were you between 4 a.m. and 5 a.m.
yesterday?</b>

335
00:21:20,757 --> 00:21:21,675
<b>Who are you?</b>

336
00:21:21,967 --> 00:21:23,260
<b>What the hell?</b>

337
00:21:23,343 --> 00:21:24,469
<b>-Wait.
-It hurts.</b>

338
00:21:24,553 --> 00:21:25,971
<b>Wait a second.</b>

339
00:21:27,013 --> 00:21:30,267
<b>Ms. Kim Su-jin, you are under arrest
for bodily injury and theft.</b>

340
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:32,185
<b>You have the right to an attorney,</b>

341
00:21:32,978 --> 00:21:34,563
<b>and you have the right to remain silent.</b>

342
00:21:34,646 --> 00:21:36,314
<b>You have all sorts of rights.</b>

343
00:21:37,399 --> 00:21:38,275
<b>Let's go.</b>

344
00:21:47,325 --> 00:21:48,535
<b>Fine. I'm coming.</b>

345
00:21:52,914 --> 00:21:54,082
<b>Detective Jeong, thank you.</b>

346
00:21:54,165 --> 00:21:55,500
<b>No problem. See you.</b>

347
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:56,459
<b>Bye.</b>

348
00:22:06,886 --> 00:22:08,972
<b>Oh, hey.</b>

349
00:22:09,806 --> 00:22:10,640
<b>Hi.</b>

350
00:22:10,724 --> 00:22:12,017
<b>What are you doing here?</b>

351
00:22:13,184 --> 00:22:14,477
<b>I'm working.</b>

352
00:22:15,061 --> 00:22:17,147
<b>I haven't heard from you in a while,
so I was curious.</b>

353
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:18,648
<b>How have you been?</b>

354
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:20,108
<b>I'm busy every day.</b>

355
00:22:20,191 --> 00:22:22,736
<b>What about your nightmares?
Is it better now?</b>

356
00:22:25,238 --> 00:22:26,197
<b>What?</b>

357
00:22:30,327 --> 00:22:32,454
<b>I've been having
sweet dreams too recently.</b>

358
00:22:32,537 --> 00:22:34,623
<b>There's no way
that you can be cured this quick.</b>

359
00:22:36,291 --> 00:22:38,084
<b>You must still eat a lot of sweets.</b>

360
00:22:39,753 --> 00:22:40,879
<b>It's better than medicine.</b>

361
00:22:40,962 --> 00:22:42,297
<b>There is no way it is.</b>

362
00:22:43,256 --> 00:22:44,799
<b>If sweets don't work, come see me again.</b>

363
00:22:52,724 --> 00:22:53,642
<b>Who is she?</b>

364
00:22:53,725 --> 00:22:56,144
<b>I have never seen any woman
who talks to you</b>

365
00:22:56,227 --> 00:22:58,730
<b>except for testifiers, suspects,</b>

366
00:22:59,397 --> 00:23:00,315
<b>and criminals.</b>

367
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,611
<b>Is that mystery man's horse
still at your place?</b>

368
00:23:07,656 --> 00:23:10,533
<b>Don't change the subject. Who is she?</b>

369
00:23:10,825 --> 00:23:12,285
<b>You're the one changing the subject.</b>

370
00:23:12,994 --> 00:23:16,164
<b>He said he was a King or something.
Was anything stolen from your house?</b>

371
00:23:17,749 --> 00:23:19,209
<b>He left, saying he was going home.</b>

372
00:23:19,876 --> 00:23:21,086
<b>Where's his home?</b>

373
00:23:21,836 --> 00:23:23,922
<b>I don't know where his home is.</b>

374
00:23:37,644 --> 00:23:40,814
<b>Yeong. Are you going to keep
giving me the silent treatment?</b>

375
00:23:44,609 --> 00:23:45,443
<b>What?</b>

376
00:23:46,111 --> 00:23:47,404
<b>Do you want me to hold your hand?</b>

377
00:23:49,823 --> 00:23:50,907
<b>Please, give me your phone.</b>

378
00:23:51,282 --> 00:23:52,867
<b>I'm going to install a GPS tracking app.</b>

379
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:55,078
<b>Because you kept</b>

380
00:23:56,371 --> 00:23:58,873
<b>staying in the study, I almost got fired.</b>

381
00:23:58,957 --> 00:23:59,916
<b>You're lying.</b>

382
00:24:01,167 --> 00:24:02,210
<b>You know what?</b>

383
00:24:02,877 --> 00:24:04,045
<b>When it was first invented,</b>

384
00:24:04,629 --> 00:24:06,464
<b>the GPS had large discrepancies</b>

385
00:24:06,548 --> 00:24:09,426
<b>between the user's location on-screen
and the actual location, but...</b>

386
00:24:09,551 --> 00:24:10,719
<b>What's your ID?</b>

387
00:24:11,678 --> 00:24:13,054
<b>"King," of course.</b>

388
00:24:13,972 --> 00:24:16,057
<b>But when they applied
Einstein's theory of relativity</b>

389
00:24:16,141 --> 00:24:18,268
<b>to the tracking process--</b>

390
00:24:18,351 --> 00:24:19,769
<b>That ID already exists.</b>

391
00:24:20,687 --> 00:24:22,939
<b>Who dare calls himself a King
when I am the King?</b>

392
00:24:24,315 --> 00:24:25,442
<b>Go for "King Two."</b>

393
00:24:26,234 --> 00:24:28,236
<b>Anyway, about the theory of relativity--</b>

394
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:30,113
<b>All Kings are taken until King 987.</b>

395
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:33,825
<b>Track the IP addresses
of those 988 people.</b>

396
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,369
<b>Right now.</b>

397
00:24:36,453 --> 00:24:37,996
<b>It's the King's order.</b>

398
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:41,583
<b>Currently, our shipbuilding companies
has bid for 120 vessels, 40 each,</b>

399
00:24:41,666 --> 00:24:45,003
<b>in order to win the transportation rights
for the LNG from Qatar Gas,</b>

400
00:24:45,086 --> 00:24:48,339
<b>which is one of Qatar's
government-controlled companies.</b>

401
00:24:49,174 --> 00:24:53,011
<b>Therefore, it's inevitable for us
to compete with the Japanese.</b>

402
00:24:53,094 --> 00:24:56,765
<b>We're already facing trouble
with our Japanese competitors</b>

403
00:24:56,848 --> 00:24:59,350
<b>regarding the patent of our PRS system--</b>

404
00:24:59,434 --> 00:25:02,228
<b>Did you prepare a presentation
to tell me that we can't do it?</b>

405
00:25:02,771 --> 00:25:06,441
<b>I bet you asked your smart subordinates
to make the PowerPoint for you.</b>

406
00:25:09,486 --> 00:25:12,113
<b>The Kingdom of Corea produces
rare-earth elements,</b>

407
00:25:12,197 --> 00:25:14,115
<b>and we have advanced technology
to process them.</b>

408
00:25:14,199 --> 00:25:16,159
<b>And thanks to that, we have allies.</b>

409
00:25:17,035 --> 00:25:21,289
<b>Figure out which country can help us
persuade Qatar as fast as possible.</b>

410
00:25:23,541 --> 00:25:25,376
<b>Next, the Ministry of Agriculture
and Forestry.</b>

411
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:28,755
<b>Why haven't I still heard about
the pesticides found in eggs?</b>

412
00:25:28,838 --> 00:25:30,173
<b>This is crazy.</b>

413
00:25:30,423 --> 00:25:32,258
<b>-Is the Prime Minister inside?
-Yes, but she's--</b>

414
00:25:32,342 --> 00:25:33,510
<b>Yes, I know. It's urgent.</b>

415
00:25:35,094 --> 00:25:36,054
<b>Ma'am.</b>

416
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:37,806
<b>Ma'am.</b>

417
00:25:38,473 --> 00:25:40,058
<b>I'm too tired to eat.</b>

418
00:25:40,725 --> 00:25:42,977
<b>I don't want to eat.
I'll have some red ginseng instead.</b>

419
00:25:44,062 --> 00:25:46,981
<b>You need to see this. It's urgent.</b>

420
00:25:49,859 --> 00:25:52,946
<i><b>That woman keeps saying
we need to spend more on national defense</i></b>

421
00:25:53,029 --> 00:25:55,198
<i><b>when she doesn't even know anything.</i></b>

422
00:25:55,281 --> 00:25:56,866
<i><b>That will only upset the Japanese.</i></b>

423
00:25:57,992 --> 00:26:01,412
<b>Congressman Park was
at Jeguk University's homecoming event.</b>

424
00:26:01,496 --> 00:26:04,415
<b>A few reporters from that university
were apparently there, too.</b>

425
00:26:06,668 --> 00:26:08,253
<i><b>I'm sick of hearing her say that.</i></b>

426
00:26:08,753 --> 00:26:12,674
<i><b>Japan is our ally.
Are you trying to start a war with them?</i></b>

427
00:26:13,341 --> 00:26:17,679
<i><b>I bet she only cares about
what she's going to wear every day.</i></b>

428
00:26:17,971 --> 00:26:20,849
<i><b>What would she know about politics?</i></b>

429
00:26:20,932 --> 00:26:22,600
<i><b>Look at her nose.</i></b>

430
00:26:22,934 --> 00:26:25,979
<i><b>It can't be her actual nose.</i></b>

431
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:29,148
<i><b>My friend is the best cosmetic surgeon
in the country.</i></b>

432
00:26:29,232 --> 00:26:30,400
<i><b>And I already asked him.</i></b>

433
00:26:30,483 --> 00:26:32,235
<b>Should I kill this jerk?</b>

434
00:26:32,986 --> 00:26:34,195
<b>What?</b>

435
00:26:34,487 --> 00:26:36,447
<b>Look at me. Does my nose look fake?</b>

436
00:26:36,531 --> 00:26:38,658
<b>It's probably because it looks so perfect.</b>

437
00:26:39,284 --> 00:26:40,118
<b>Right?</b>

438
00:26:41,744 --> 00:26:44,289
<b>Then let's just make him
regret that he's alive.</b>

439
00:26:52,255 --> 00:26:54,465
<b>Send this to Reporter Song.
Tell him it's exclusive.</b>

<b>My goodness.</b>

441
00:27:02,348 --> 00:27:05,894
<b>Why did you keep...
I mean, where did you get this?</b>

442
00:27:07,103 --> 00:27:09,397
<b>Mr. Kim, you've been working for me
for a year and a half.</b>

443
00:27:09,939 --> 00:27:12,400
<b>I'm surprised you seem intrigued

444
00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:15,069
<b>What's the matter with you?</b>

445
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:18,698
<b>Do you really want to be a politician?
I'm really curious.</b>

446
00:27:19,282 --> 00:27:20,325
<b>I'll send it right away.</b>

447
00:27:29,834 --> 00:27:31,836
<b>Where do you get those kinds of photos?</b>

448
00:27:33,796 --> 00:27:35,048
<b>I'm just really curious.</b>

449
00:27:36,257 --> 00:27:37,926
<b>Why don't you have coffee outside?</b>

450
00:27:38,551 --> 00:27:40,386
<b>You should drink near the campus.</b>

451
00:27:41,012 --> 00:27:42,972
<b>And with someone handsome if possible.</b>

452
00:28:02,659 --> 00:28:03,618
<b>Prime Minister Koo.</b>

453
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:08,790
<b>It's been a while, Prince Buyeong.</b>

454
00:28:09,666 --> 00:28:10,583
<b>I'm glad.</b>

455
00:28:10,667 --> 00:28:12,251
<b>What do you mean?</b>

456
00:28:12,543 --> 00:28:14,504
<b>His Majesty has been away.</b>
