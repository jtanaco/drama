<b>She said I was no longer a baby.</b>

<b>- Two?
- One of them is Choi Young Woong,</b>

<b>her ex-boyfriend.</b>

<b>A few days ago, he reported her

<b>Is he the one who requested
a restraining order?</b>

73
00:06:59,649 --> 00:07:01,266
<b>Yes. There's a high possibility...</b>

74

<b>that he and Se Rin fought

75

<b>- Who's the other suspect?
- Do you remember...</b>

<b>the assault case

<b>She's the victim.</b>

<b>Se Rin did everything

<b>So why did she die?</b>

90
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:17,899
<b>Why did you let her die?</b>

91

<b>You said you quit work because

92

<b>That was a lie, right?</b>

93
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,610
<b>There's no way...</b>

<b>I'd like to report something.</b>

96

<b>When was the last time

<b>It was right before I reported her

98
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,860
<b>I saw her for the last time

99
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:29,170
<b>When was the last time

100
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:31,200
<b>Yesterday,</b>

101
00:09:32,169 --> 00:09:35,710
<b>at around 6:30 p.m.,

<b>- Was that it?
- Yes.</b>

103
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,409
<b>So that actually happened?</b>

00:09:43,179 --> 00:09:44,250
<b>Young Woong.</b>

105

<b>Kim Se Rin, please!</b>

106
00:09:51,659 --> 00:09:53,320
<b>She kept asking where I was.</b>

107
00:09:56,029 --> 00:09:57,590
<b>So I just hung up on her.</b>

108
00:09:58,629 --> 00:10:00,000
<b>Did she say anything else?</b>

109
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:03,970
<b>Not really.</b>

<b>at my friend's house.</b>

113

114

<b>No.</b>

115
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:24,120
<b>It was another friend.</b>

116
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:30,289
<b>I confirmed

<b>It checked out.</b>

118
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:34,700
<b>I checked the call she made

119
00:10:34,929 --> 00:10:35,946
<b>It lasted for 3 minutes

120
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:37,200
<b>3 minutes and 40 seconds?</b>

121
00:10:37,899 --> 00:10:40,100
<b>What is it?

122
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:43,070
<b>No, nothing.</b>

123

<b>Ga Hyeon.</b>

124
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,139
<b>To be honest, when the news said...</b>

125
00:11:15,909 --> 00:11:17,669
<b>that it was a woman in her 20s,</b>

126
00:11:17,779 --> 00:11:19,980
<b>I was worried it was you.</b>

127
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:26,779
<b>So I called Detective Ji.</b>

128
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:28,450
<b>That's when I found out

00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,399
<b>Se Rin had lied...</b>

133
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:44,206
<b>about everything.</b>

134
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:45,299
<b>What?</b>

135
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:47,870
<b>I don't understand.</b>

136
00:11:51,309 --> 00:11:52,639
<b>That's unbelievable.</b>

137
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:55,649
<b>You must've been greatly shocked.</b>

138
00:11:56,179 --> 00:11:58,149
<b>You cared for her
like you were family.</b>

139
00:11:58,779 --> 00:12:02,120
<b>You're right. I hated her so much.</b>

140
00:12:03,149 --> 00:12:06,820
<b>That's why I told her
never to visit me again.</b>

141
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,129
<b>And it really happened.</b>

142
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:15,830
<b>She must've been terrified.</b>

143
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:18,240
<b>She must've felt...</b>

144
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,139
<b>extremely lonely.</b>

145
00:12:22,309 --> 00:12:25,139
<b>I should've believed her
one last time.</b>

146
00:12:26,409 --> 00:12:30,250
<b>Perhaps, I wasn't mad at her.</b>

147
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:33,525
<b>I might have been mad at myself...</b>

148
00:12:33,549 --> 00:12:36,250
<b>for being so terrified
about dying next.</b>

149
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:41,129
<b>I visited Ms. Lee Shin.</b>

150
00:12:42,059 --> 00:12:45,799
<b>I begged her to save my life

151
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:50,669
<b>That's what I did

152

<b>Even at this age,</b>

153
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:58,580
<b>I still don't want to die.</b>

154
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:00,710
<b>It's understandable.</b>

155
00:13:03,879 --> 00:13:05,279
<b>Actually,</b>

156
00:13:07,149 --> 00:13:08,919
<b>I visited her as well.</b>

157
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,759

00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:16,889
<b>But she didn't give in.</b>

159
00:13:19,529 --> 00:13:21,370
<b>Whenever I think...</b>

160
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,470
<b>about leaving my sick wife behind,</b>

161
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,299
<b>it tortures me...</b>

162
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:29,639
<b>every single day.</b>

163
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:03,615
<b>What is it?</b>

164
00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:06,385
<b>- What?
- I got Ms. Kim Se Rin's call logs.</b>

165
00:14:06,409 --> 00:14:08,649
<b>I'm going to meet the last person
she spoke with.</b>

166
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:11,350
<b>What is it? Give it to me.</b>

167
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:14,250
<b>No. Summon her.</b>

168
00:14:21,289 --> 00:14:22,489
<b>Why aren't you going in there?</b>

169
00:14:22,659 --> 00:14:23,979
<b>Are you trying to intimidate her?</b>

170
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:39,210
<b>I thought you'd refuse to come here.
I'm surprised.</b>

171
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,710
<b>This is concerning Se Rin.</b>

172
00:14:41,009 --> 00:14:43,279
<b>I should do everything I can
to help.</b>

173
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:47,679
<b>What did you two talk about?</b>

174
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:53,190
<b>I'm afraid I can't tell you.</b>

175
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:56,860
<b>I'm not allowed to disclose
my conversations with my patients.</b>

176
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:58,460
<b>You do know that, right?</b>

177
00:14:59,029 --> 00:15:02,470
<b>Are you saying Ms. Kim Se Rin
was a patient at Zian Clinic?</b>

178
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,500
<b>Yes.</b>

179
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:08,809
<b>If not, how do you think I knew her?</b>

180
00:15:10,169 --> 00:15:12,610
<b>I can show you the records.</b>

181
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:16,549
<b>That is, if you have a warrant.</b>

182
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:21,490
<b>Where were you on November 9,
between 8:00 p.m. to 12:00 a.m.?</b>

183
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:25,919
<b>Do you doubt me as the culprit?</b>

184
00:15:26,419 --> 00:15:28,405
<b>It's just a formality.</b>

185
00:15:28,429 --> 00:15:30,829
<b>If you aren't the culprit,
it's not that difficult to answer.</b>

186
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:32,600
<b>I was at Zian Clinic.</b>

187
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,299
<b>Could you turn in
the security footage?</b>

188
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:38,940
<b>If you need me to bring one,</b>

189
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:40,399
<b>I'll bring the warrant.</b>

190
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:46,639
<b>So this was your plan.</b>

191
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:50,049
<b>To investigate Zian Clinic
by using this case as an excuse.</b>

192
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:55,750
<b>It won't be easy.</b>

193
00:15:56,519 --> 00:15:59,690
<b>It may be difficult,
but it's a great opportunity.</b>

194
00:16:01,529 --> 00:16:02,706
<b>What are they talking about?</b>

195
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:05,529
<b>What on earth is Zian Clinic
that he wants to investigate it?</b>

196
00:16:05,629 --> 00:16:07,949
<b>What we do know is that
this isn't the first time they met.</b>

197
00:16:18,309 --> 00:16:22,279
<b>I didn't think
we had an honest talk in there.</b>

198
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:27,379
<b>Both the questions and answers.</b>

199
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:31,519
<b>I guess you're scared
that I might get a warrant.</b>

200
00:16:32,019 --> 00:16:35,360
<b>Why? Is there something
you need to tell?</b>

201
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:41,700
<b>I can't believe
I'm the last one Se Rin talked to.</b>

202
00:16:42,629 --> 00:16:44,200
<b>That's pretty sad.</b>

203
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,600
<b>If I had known,</b>

204
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,210
<b>I could have been nicer.</b>

205
00:16:54,009 --> 00:16:55,950
<b>You're still in Seoul?</b>

206
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:59,155
<b>Yes. Because of Young Woong.</b>

207
00:16:59,179 --> 00:17:01,519
<b>I gave you a chance to live,</b>

208
00:17:01,889 --> 00:17:04,419
<b>but you're still looking
for Young Woong.</b>

209
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:06,460
<b>You can't blame me now.</b>

210
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:10,360
<b>I made sure I keep my promise.</b>

211
00:17:13,029 --> 00:17:14,130
<b>Wait.</b>

212
00:17:14,769 --> 00:17:16,476
<b>Was it me? Am I going to die?</b>

213
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,269
<b>When? Where?
Ma'am, what should I do now?</b>

214
00:17:20,769 --> 00:17:22,069
<b>Se Rin.</b>

215
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:24,210
<b>Yes, ma'am.</b>

216
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,109
<b>It's...</b>

217
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:30,150
<b>too late.</b>

218
00:17:30,779 --> 00:17:32,819
<b>Ms. Lee. Ms. Lee!</b>

219
00:17:44,259 --> 00:17:45,759
<b>Isn't fate...</b>

220
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:48,329
<b>so fascinating?</b>

221
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:50,829
<b>In the end...</b>

222
00:17:52,299 --> 00:17:54,640
<b>you end up living the life
you're destined to live.</b>

223
00:17:56,009 --> 00:17:58,009
<b>Why are you taking things this far?</b>

224
00:18:00,109 --> 00:18:02,380
<b>I told Se Rin
everything she can do to avoid this.</b>

225
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:04,849
<b>She's the one
who didn't do anything and died.</b>

226
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:09,750
<b>She was the first member
who could have changed her fate.</b>

227
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:15,350
<b>Then you must have known
she would've been killed.</b>

228
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:20,559
<b>That means you know the culprit.
Who was it? Bae Jung Tae?</b>

229
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,140
<b>I'm not sure.</b>

230
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,970
<b>Up until the last reset,</b>

231
00:18:30,839 --> 00:18:33,140
<b>Se Rin's case was unresolved.</b>

232
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:36,880
<b>If the culprit is Bae Jung Tae,</b>

233
00:18:38,549 --> 00:18:41,019
<b>This unexpected turn of event
will make it entertaining.</b>

234
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:44,589
<b>I really look forward to this,</b>

235
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:46,720
<b>Detective Ji.</b>

236
00:19:05,539 --> 00:19:07,716
<b>- What?
- Come quickly.</b>

237
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:08,956
<b>Things are chaotic here.</b>

238
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,025
<b>What?</b>

239
00:19:10,049 --> 00:19:11,250
<b>(Police line, do not cross)</b>

240
00:19:17,549 --> 00:19:19,660
<b>What is this? What has he done?</b>

241
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:24,029
<b>- You're here.
- He did this as soon as he got out.</b>

242
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:32,769
<b>We have to run a DNA analysis,</b>

243
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,039
<b>but it's probably her.</b>

244
00:19:49,619 --> 00:19:50,720
<b>We have...</b>

245
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:53,059
<b>a lot to discuss, don't we?</b>

246
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:59,430
<b>Why did you do that to me?</b>

247
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:06,140
<b>I did it because I wanted to
work things out with Young Woong.</b>

248
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:09,769
<b>I didn't think
the detective would show up.</b>

249
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:11,609
<b>I'm so sorry.</b>

250
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:14,480
<b>You do know that
you can't say a few words...</b>

251
00:20:15,549 --> 00:20:16,809
<b>to make this okay, don't you?</b>

252
00:20:26,019 --> 00:20:27,690
<b>What can I do...</b>

253
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:30,630
<b>to destroy you
without Ji Hyeong Ju finding out?</b>

254
00:20:32,859 --> 00:20:34,660
<b>That's all I had on my mind...</b>

255
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:37,269
<b>over the last seven months.</b>

256
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:43,210
<b>There's not a lot of things
you can do in prison.</b>

257
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:46,539
<b>You aren't going to kill me,
are you?</b>

258
00:20:47,009 --> 00:20:49,450
<b>You aren't that bad.</b>

259
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:52,420
<b>That's why you helped me.</b>

260
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:58,119
<b>Bad news.</b>

261
00:20:58,359 --> 00:21:01,289
<b>I definitely want to...</b>

262
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:05,359
<b>kill you right now.</b>

263
00:21:20,309 --> 00:21:22,680
<b>I haven't seen him for a few months.</b>

264
00:21:22,849 --> 00:21:24,849
<b>He walked in with this woman.</b>

265
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:36,660
<b>Did she walk in willingly?</b>

266
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:39,505
<b>- Yes.
- Do you know what time it was?</b>

267
00:21:39,529 --> 00:21:42,876
<b>I was on my way to work
in the afternoon,</b>

268
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:45,045
<b>so it was around 3:30 p.m.</b>

269
00:21:45,069 --> 00:21:46,369
<b>"3:30 p.m."?</b>

270
00:21:48,299 --> 00:21:50,440
<b>Are you sure it was
Mr. Bae Jung Tae?</b>

271
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:51,710
<b>What?</b>

272
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:56,650
<b>Well, it was definitely a man.</b>

273
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:03,565
<b>You can go back for now.</b>

274
00:22:03,589 --> 00:22:04,595
<b>One second.</b>

275
00:22:04,619 --> 00:22:05,866
<b>I just asked around,</b>

276
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:07,735
<b>and the woman next door
saw him at 3:30 p.m.</b>

277
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:10,265
<b>- Hello?
- But we got here at 4:00 p.m.</b>

278
00:22:10,289 --> 00:22:12,529
<b>- Yes?
- Then who did that woman see?</b>

279
00:22:12,859 --> 00:22:14,476
<b>This means he had an accomplice.</b>

280
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,799
<b>Yes.</b>

281
00:22:16,069 --> 00:22:18,305
<b>Kim Se Rin's phone was...</b>

282
00:22:18,329 --> 00:22:20,000
<b>found near her studio.</b>

283
00:22:20,099 --> 00:22:21,140
<b>One second.</b>

284
00:22:21,269 --> 00:22:23,640
<b>They found a record of
Ms. Kim Se Rin taking a taxi.</b>

285
00:22:24,539 --> 00:22:25,656
<b>(Sa Kyung)</b>

286
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,956
<b>She took the taxi
at the bus terminal at 2:36 p.m.</b>

287
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:30,300
<b>Then she got off around
Bae Jung Tae's house in 40 minutes.</b>

288
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:32,196
<b>Did you get a hold
of the taxi driver?</b>

289
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:34,055
<b>Yes, I asked him
for the dashcam footage,</b>

290
00:22:34,079 --> 00:22:36,719
<b>but he's out of town right now.
He'll see tomorrow at the earliest.</b>

291
00:22:37,819 --> 00:22:40,866
<b>But she got in another taxi
after three hours.</b>

292
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:42,029
<b>Where did she go?</b>

293
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:43,906
<b>Back to her studio.</b>

294
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:45,406
<b>But she didn't leave from his house.</b>

295
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:47,505
<b>- Then?
- The hospital. Sejin Hospital.</b>

296
00:22:47,529 --> 00:22:48,930
<b>Did she get hurt?</b>

297
00:22:49,829 --> 00:22:52,275
<b>What's going on?
Hey. Where are you going?</b>

298
00:22:52,299 --> 00:22:53,646
<b>- Hey.
- Hello?</b>

299
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:56,716
<b>Sa Kyung, request the security

<b>- I'll see you at the office.
- Yes, sir.</b>

<b>I didn't kill her.</b>

614
00:48:02,490 --> 00:48:03,630
<b>I really didn't.</b>

615
00:48:05,430 --> 00:48:07,299
<b>Then, tell me where you were.</b>

616
00:48:12,369 --> 00:48:14,109
<b>There are usually
two types of people...</b>

617
00:48:14,539 --> 00:48:15,869
<b>who can't prove their alibis.</b>

618
00:48:16,369 --> 00:48:17,710
<b>Whether they are the culprit...</b>

619
00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:20,480
<b>or were committing another crime.</b>

620
00:48:22,410 --> 00:48:23,680
<b>Which one are you?</b>

621
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:28,250
<b>I was with Choi Min Ho.</b>

622
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:32,289
<b>I was just leaving
Kim Se Rin's house.</b>

623
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:35,239
<b>And my friend called me
and said he found Choi Min Ho.</b>

624
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:39,230
<b>I can't recognize you
even if I'm looking at you.</b>

625
00:48:40,599 --> 00:48:41,670
<b>Young Woong?</b>

626
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,670
<b>Who knew you had become a "hero"?</b>

627
00:48:45,140 --> 00:48:46,470
<b>I had no idea.</b>

628
00:48:47,069 --> 00:48:48,509
<b>Why did you find me?</b>

629
00:48:50,009 --> 00:48:52,210
<b>Are you here to apologize?</b>

630
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:54,450
<b>Apologize?</b>

631
00:49:00,119 --> 00:49:01,190
<b>Apologize?</b>

632
00:49:02,589 --> 00:49:03,849
<b>You should apologize to me.</b>

633
00:49:05,819 --> 00:49:07,690
<b>You totally pulled one over on me.</b>

634
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:13,230
<b>First, I just wanted to stop you.</b>

635
00:49:14,430 --> 00:49:18,099
<b>Now that I'm seeing your face,
I'm getting so angry.</b>

636
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:23,269
<b>What are you talking about?</b>

637
00:49:23,809 --> 00:49:25,240
<b>What did I do to you?</b>

638
00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:29,279
<b>Exactly.</b>

639
00:49:29,710 --> 00:49:31,196
<b>You should have left the past
in the past...</b>

640
00:49:31,220 --> 00:49:32,680
<b>and lived with your new name.</b>

641
00:49:32,819 --> 00:49:34,265
<b>Why did you upload that
on social media?</b>

642
00:49:34,289 --> 00:49:36,849
<b>Why did you anger my old man
who's working to serve this country?</b>

643
00:49:37,049 --> 00:49:38,619
<b>When did I do that?</b>

644
00:49:40,089 --> 00:49:41,160
<b>Right.</b>

645
00:49:43,089 --> 00:49:45,930
<b>Forget it.
You don't need to know that.</b>

646
00:49:47,730 --> 00:49:48,829
<b>Did you eat?</b>

647
00:49:56,509 --> 00:49:58,809
<b>- Young Woong.
- You lost weight.</b>

648
00:49:59,180 --> 00:50:01,255
<b>Hey, should I jog your memory?</b>

649
00:50:01,279 --> 00:50:03,049
<b>Should I? Yes?</b>

650
00:50:03,849 --> 00:50:04,849
<b>Does it hurt?</b>

651
00:50:06,779 --> 00:50:08,549
<b>- Stay still.
- Don't move.</b>

652
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:16,890
<b>My alibi checks out now, right?</b>

653
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:21,369
<b>I can go, right?</b>

654
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,140
<b>You might be able
to dodge the murder charge,</b>

655
00:50:24,599 --> 00:50:26,740
<b>but I can lock you up
with the assault charge.</b>

656
00:50:30,809 --> 00:50:33,779
<b>It won't work even if you try.</b>

657
00:50:35,650 --> 00:50:37,696
<b>No prosecution
if the victim doesn't press charges.</b>

658
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:39,356
<b>(Crimes can't be prosecuted
if the victims object.)</b>

659
00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:40,579
<b>I'm sure you know that well.</b>

660
00:50:43,450 --> 00:50:47,220
<b>Choi Min Ho still listens to me.</b>

661
00:50:51,559 --> 00:50:53,230
<b>He told me that...</b>

662
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,245
<b>he could ruin my family's future
if he wanted.</b>

663
00:50:56,269 --> 00:50:57,789
<b>I know too well
that he's not bluffing.</b>

664
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:01,369
<b>I experienced enough of that
in high school.</b>

665
00:51:01,910 --> 00:51:03,869
<b>It could be different this time.</b>

666
00:51:04,279 --> 00:51:05,339
<b>No.</b>

667
00:51:07,079 --> 00:51:08,686
<b>I changed my name...</b>

668
00:51:08,710 --> 00:51:10,380
<b>and went on a diet.</b>

669
00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:12,555
<b>I passed the GED
and got into college.</b>

670
00:51:12,579 --> 00:51:14,119
<b>I thought I was living a new life.</b>

671
00:51:15,690 --> 00:51:17,220
<b>In the end, it's the same.</b>

672
00:51:19,420 --> 00:51:21,690
<b>I'm bound to face misfortune
in this life.</b>

673
00:51:22,890 --> 00:51:25,430
<b>Even if Se Rin told you only lies,</b>

674
00:51:26,660 --> 00:51:29,230
<b>she was heartbroken by your past...</b>

675
00:51:29,829 --> 00:51:32,900
<b>and wanted to make Ko Jae Young
kneel and get an apology from him.</b>

676
00:51:34,670 --> 00:51:36,740
<b>I'm sure those were true.</b>

677
00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:41,210
<b>Kim Se Rin, please!</b>

678
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:45,049
<b>Young Woong,
Ko Jae Young is looking for you.</b>

679

<b>I can't say for sure
about other things,</b>

680
00:51:52,190 --> 00:51:54,660
<b>but he wants to hide
the crimes his son committed...</b>

681
00:51:54,829 --> 00:51:56,406
<b>and hurt others
as collateral damage.</b>

682
00:51:56,430 --> 00:51:58,660
<b>That kind of person can't be
the Minister of Education.</b>

<b>Open up!</b>

684
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:10,109
<b>Open it right now!</b>

685
00:52:11,210 --> 00:52:12,680
<b>You jerks!</b>

686
00:52:13,140 --> 00:52:14,279
<b>Hey!</b>

687
00:52:23,549 --> 00:52:25,420
<b>I got it. Okay?</b>

688
00:52:25,690 --> 00:52:26,759
<b>Let go of me.</b>

689

<b>Where's the video?</b>

690
00:52:40,470 --> 00:52:43,009
<b>Who are you? What video?</b>

691
00:52:44,779 --> 00:52:47,009
<b>I already deleted everything
on this phone.</b>

692
00:52:49,779 --> 00:52:51,349
<b>It was about Ko Jae Young.</b>

693

<b>What's so important

<b>What's all this fuss?</b>

<b>You scumbag.
How dare you threaten me?</b>

701

<b>That should be enough

<b>If you don't squeak

<b>It's all thanks to the reporters.</b>

710

<b>When they were yapping about it,</b>

711
00:54:24,279 --> 00:54:26,319

<b>Isn't that Bae Jung Tae?</b>
