<b>for our Gourmandism Business

<b>as the base of the Gourmandism Business</b>

<b>also attracting tourists

<b>[ with a proper eco-friendly system ]</b>

<b>Seung-mo, your father and mother</b>

00:31:44,410 --> 00:31:45,565
<b>What do you mean?</b>

466
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,335
<b>Of course, I'm talking
about your taste in women.</b>

467
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:50,249
<b>I didn't know you liked
that type of woman.</b>

468
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:51,979
<b>She's not my type.</b>

469
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:54,619
<b>Yes, she is. You looked cute together.</b>

470
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:56,319
<b>What are you doing?</b>

471
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,685
<b>Are you jealous or something?</b>

472
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:02,085
<b>Jealous? Why would I be jealous?</b>

473
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:03,955
<b>[ Don't be ridiculous. ]</b>

474
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:17,169
<b>Father, he's suspicious.</b>

475
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:19,065
<b>Did you feel that too?</b>

476
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:22,605
<b>I happened to hear them talk a bit.</b>

477
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:25,809
<b>Seung-mo talks to her with respect,</b>

478
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:27,649
<b>but that rude wench</b>

479
00:32:27,650 --> 00:32:30,919
<b>talks down to her husband.</b>

480
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,389
<b>What kind of wife does that?</b>

481
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:34,815
<b>Right? You're right.</b>

482
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:39,555
<b>That skinny woman is
just not as pretty as you.</b>

483
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:43,325
<b>I can't understand him either.</b>

484
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:46,299
<b>He's really suspicious.</b>

485
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:48,465
<b>They don't look like a married couple.</b>

486
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:52,465
<b>Not once have I been wrong
about these things.</b>

487
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:55,809
<b>Then what do we do now?</b>

488
00:32:55,810 --> 00:32:59,109
<b>What do you mean by that?
Of course we should reveal the truth.</b>

489
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:01,815
<b>We will make things back to normal.</b>

490
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:06,555
<b>Mi-nyeo, I think
we should prepare a feast.</b>

<b>No one can resist our family's liquor.</b>

492

<b>Thanks.</b>

523
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:54,459
<b>Right. Mr. Hong said</b>

<b>he would like to apologize to you.</b>

<b>Because he decided to work with us.</b>

<b>It seems that the county office

<b>Don't you think we should make a move too?</b>

<b>We are just about to merge

<b>We won't do anything

<b>But...</b>

531
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:30,465
<b>Memorandum of understanding

<b>It can easily be torn.</b>

533

<b>You have traveled a long way.

<b>Sorry, we have to get going early today.</b>

535

<b>So, you don't need my ssi-ganjang?</b>

<b>No, that's not it, sir.</b>

537
00:35:57,690 --> 00:36:00,795
<b>Then have a drink with me.</b>

538
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,295
<b>I'm disappointed.</b>

539
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,135
<b>This is so good!</b>

540
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:11,739
<b>Where are your manners?</b>

541
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:14,939
<b>What did your parents teach you at home?</b>

542
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:18,209
<b>How dare you start drinking
when the elder hasn't eaten yet?</b>

543
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:20,879
<b>It's not my fault
that the drink is so enticing.</b>

544
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,919
<b>Have we met before?
Why are you talking so informally to me?</b>

545
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,745
<b>She lived abroad for a long time,</b>

546
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,715
<b>so she's not used to
the Korean culture yet.</b>

547
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,755
<b>So, a Western fox, I see.</b>

548
00:36:31,090 --> 00:36:33,555
<b>What did you say? A Western fox?</b>

549
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:35,595
<b>Stop it!</b>

550
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:37,799
<b>Excuse me, may I take this call?</b>

551
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,095
<b>Sure, go ahead.</b>

552
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:42,495
<b>What does a Western fox mean?</b>

553
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:46,435
<b>That's our way of saying</b>

554
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:51,505
<b>that you're beautiful.</b>

555
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:54,175
<b>Then you can be a Western fox, too.</b>

556
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:56,119
<b>What did you just say?</b>

557
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:58,485
<b>You're beautiful, too.</b>

558
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,915
<b>Hello, Chef Moon.</b>

559
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,225
<b>I talked with Mr. Hong. It went well.</b>

560
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:05,025
<b>[ That's good to hear. ]</b>

561
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:08,895
<b>Does that mean that our village isn't
in danger of being demolished, then?</b>

562
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,425
<b>It's too early to say.</b>

563
00:37:10,830 --> 00:37:12,665
<b>[ Mr. Lim won't let it go this easy. ]</b>

564
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:16,665
<b>Speaking of which,
can you open your restaurant faster?</b>

565
00:37:18,610 --> 00:37:20,035
<b>[ When do you think you can open it? ]</b>

566
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:22,639
<b>My business permit should be out soon,</b>

567
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:23,905
<b>so it won't take long.</b>

568
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:26,675
<b>Sorry for rushing you. You already have
so much on your plate already.</b>

569
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:29,245
<b>[ I think we should hurry
when we have the momentum. ]</b>

570
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:32,285
<b>- I'll see you at the opening.
- Yes.</b>

571
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:41,595
<b>Have another drink.</b>

572
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:50,209
<b>Chef Moon, you try some as well.
It's absolutely delicious.</b>

573
00:37:50,210 --> 00:37:51,835
<b>That's right.</b>

574
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:56,809
<b>We made this drink
when our Mi-nyeo was born.</b>

575
00:37:56,810 --> 00:37:58,675
<b>It's as old as Mi-nyeo.</b>

576
00:38:00,050 --> 00:38:02,919
<b>I was going to open it up</b>

577
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,915
<b>when she brings my son-in-law...</b>

578
00:38:05,990 --> 00:38:08,589
<b>[ That's okay. ]</b>

579
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:10,989
<b>Who cares about who drinks it, anyway?</b>

580
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:14,259
<b>All right. I'll just have a drink.</b>

581
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:17,325
<b>Really? Sure.</b>

582
00:38:23,770 --> 00:38:26,339
<b>You must be hungry
from coming all the way here,</b>

583
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:28,439
<b>so let's eat.</b>

584
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,405
<b>Thank you.</b>

585
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:46,859
<b>Why are you guys eating like that
when you're a married couple?</b>

586
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:47,829
<b>Sorry?</b>

587
00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:50,469
<b>A husband has to tear the meat</b>

588

<b>[ and feed it to his wife. ]</b>

589

<b>Are you sure you guys are married?</b>

590
00:38:57,110 --> 00:38:58,165
<b>You're right.</b>

591
00:39:04,010 --> 00:39:05,545
<b>- Here.
- Good.</b>

592
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:11,615
<b>Hold on.</b>

593
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:14,715
<b>[ Sorry. ]</b>

<b>Here.</b>

<b>Sorry.</b>

<b>The bride seems to be quite shy.</b>

<b>- We're newlyweds.
[ - I see. ]</b>

598
00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:33,935
<b>Congratulations, anyway.</b>

599
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:38,379
<b>Let's drink some more.</b>

600
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:39,445
<b>Cheers.</b>

601
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:01,795
<b>Where did you two meet?</b>

602
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:03,635
<b>- Us?
- Yes.</b>

603
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:06,905
<b>We met in Australia.</b>

604

<b>No, we met in the mountains.</b>

605

<b>Don't you remember?</b>

606
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:15,415
<b>You carried me on your back
down the mountain.</b>

607
00:40:16,850 --> 00:40:18,849
<b>You guys are too young
to have Alzheimer's.</b>

608
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:22,159
<b>How come your memories are so different?</b>

609
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:25,785
<b>We met in Australia and in the mountains.</b>

610

<b>That's what happened.</b>

611

<b>Chef Moon,</b>

613

<b>I admit that your eyes are handsome.</b>

614

<b>Whenever you look at me with those eyes,</b>

<b>you have no idea how fast my heart beats.</b>

616

<b>It's not just the eyes!</b>
