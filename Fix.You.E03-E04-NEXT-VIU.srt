<b>Isn't this what boyfriends are for?</b>

633
00:45:45,904 --> 00:45:47,513
<b>I broke up with that jerk.</b>

634
00:45:48,414 --> 00:45:50,213
<b>What? When?</b>

635
00:45:50,213 --> 00:45:51,944
<b>It turned out he was two-timing me.</b>

636
00:45:52,483 --> 00:45:54,454
<b>He was the one who wrote that article too.</b>

637
00:46:01,393 --> 00:46:03,054
<b>Why is my life so messed up?</b>

638
00:46:04,924 --> 00:46:06,064
<b>I'm not asking for much.</b>

639

<b>Is that so hard?</b>

642
00:46:15,373 --> 00:46:17,044
<b>Is it because I wasn't born like others?</b>

643
00:46:17,044 --> 00:46:19,843
<b>Hey. There's no one as kind and pretty as you.</b>

<b>You tend to be too nosy though.</b>

<b>There's something that makes me even angrier.</b>

<b>You know Dr. Lee Si Joon too, right?</b>

647
00:46:29,154 --> 00:46:31,123
<b>The doctor at Ji Hee's hospital? What about him?</b>

648
00:46:31,123 --> 00:46:33,024
<b>That jerk used me.</b>

649
00:46:33,794 --> 00:46:35,623
<b>He's not someone who would do that.</b>

650

<b>I drop my head and shed tears</b>

<b>I love you</b>

00:47:22,534 --> 00:47:25,204
<b>You're the only one in this world</b>

<b>- silently without answering - silently without answering</b>

669
00:47:36,483 --> 00:47:37,554
<b>Let's go!</b>

670
00:47:47,064 --> 00:47:48,133
<b>This feels great!</b>

00:47:49,334 --> 00:47:50,564

672
00:47:51,233 --> 00:47:53,133
<b>Stop. That's enough.</b>

673
00:47:54,404 --> 00:47:55,434

<b>for case 2020-KD-578.</b>

<b>Impersonating an official...</b>

681
00:49:17,954 --> 00:49:22,054
<b>becomes a crime when the culprit abuses the official's authority.</b>

682
00:49:22,154 --> 00:49:25,263
<b>It's hard to state that defendant Cha Dong Il...</b>

683
00:49:25,263 --> 00:49:28,064
<b>abused an official's authority.</b>

684
00:49:28,433 --> 00:49:31,363
<b>Also, according to his psychiatric evaluation,</b>

685

<b>he has a very poor sense of reality,</b>

686

<b>and he was diagnosed with a delusional disorder.</b>

687

<b>Therefore, the charges of impersonating an official...</b>

688
00:49:42,373 --> 00:49:43,373
<b>are dismissed.</b>

<b>It was for a short while,</b>

00:50:21,214 --> 00:50:25,724
<b>but let's say you were pretending to be the lead of a superhero movie.</b>
