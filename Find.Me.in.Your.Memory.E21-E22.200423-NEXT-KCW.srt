<b>(Episode 21)</b>

2
00:00:10,577 --> 00:00:13,416
<b>Welcome home, girls.</b>

3
00:00:13,716 --> 00:00:15,917
<b>Gosh, Ms. Park.</b>

4
00:00:16,117 --> 00:00:17,617
<b>This is why you told us
to come an hour later.</b>

5
00:00:17,617 --> 00:00:19,386
<b>Did you prepare all these yourself?</b>

6
00:00:19,386 --> 00:00:21,427
<b>I just blew up a few balloons,
that's all.</b>

7
00:00:21,427 --> 00:00:23,357
<b>Goodness, how many balloons
did you blow up?</b>

8
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:25,026
<b>Ha Jin, do you like it?</b>

9
00:00:25,026 --> 00:00:26,697
<b>I love it.</b>

10
00:00:26,896 --> 00:00:29,166
<b>Ms. Park, you must have taken
an interest in surprising people.</b>

11
00:00:29,166 --> 00:00:30,267
<b>Wait till you go upstairs.</b>

12
00:00:30,267 --> 00:00:31,866
<b>I redecorated everything
just in case...</b>

13
00:00:31,866 --> 00:00:33,006
<b>something brings back bad memories.</b>

14
00:00:33,006 --> 00:00:35,407
<b>Don't worry about that.
I already forgot everything.</b>

15
00:00:57,997 --> 00:00:58,997
<b>What do you think?</b>

16
00:00:59,127 --> 00:01:00,266
<b>It's so pretty.</b>

17
00:01:00,266 --> 00:01:01,627
<b>I like this much better than before.</b>

18
00:01:01,627 --> 00:01:03,037
<b>I'm glad.</b>

19
00:01:03,037 --> 00:01:04,766
<b>I put in a bit of an effort.</b>

20
00:01:06,237 --> 00:01:08,466
<b>Get some rest. I need to take this.</b>

21
00:01:12,037 --> 00:01:13,246
<b>Are you sure you're okay?</b>

22
00:01:13,246 --> 00:01:16,047
<b>Of course. There's no reason
for me not to be okay.</b>

23
00:01:16,446 --> 00:01:18,476
<b>You should unpack and get some rest.
I need to rest too.</b>

24
00:01:18,677 --> 00:01:19,687
<b>Okay.</b>

25
00:01:20,317 --> 00:01:21,317
<b>Get some rest.</b>

26
00:01:57,256 --> 00:01:58,256
<b>Ha Jin.</b>

27
00:01:59,386 --> 00:02:01,256
<b>What's going on?
What's with that face?</b>

28
00:02:01,987 --> 00:02:03,896
<b>- What is?
- You were making an odd face.</b>

29
00:02:03,896 --> 00:02:05,297
<b>You were touching your lips and all.</b>

30
00:02:05,797 --> 00:02:07,166
<b>When? I didn't do that.</b>

31
00:02:07,166 --> 00:02:08,267
<b>You seem suspicious.</b>

32
00:02:08,666 --> 00:02:10,037
<b>Very suspicious.</b>

33
00:02:11,336 --> 00:02:13,237
<b>No, it's nothing. What is it?</b>

34
00:02:13,237 --> 00:02:15,706
<b>Right. We're getting
some sandwiches.</b>

35
00:02:15,706 --> 00:02:17,377
<b>- Do you want one?
- Yes, I do.</b>

36
00:02:17,377 --> 00:02:18,777
<b>Okay. Bacon and egg?</b>

37
00:02:18,777 --> 00:02:19,777
<b>Yes.</b>

38
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:05,386
<b>(Find Me in Your Memory)</b>

39
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:33,647
<b>What's the point of coming
to see me? It does nothing good.</b>

40
00:03:33,647 --> 00:03:34,886
<b>You're only ruining my day.</b>

41
00:03:37,117 --> 00:03:38,117
<b>What?</b>

42
00:03:38,117 --> 00:03:40,587
<b>Did you want to see how frustrated
I was to be locked up here?</b>

43
00:03:44,456 --> 00:03:47,426
<b>Too bad. I'm perfectly fine.</b>

44
00:03:48,397 --> 00:03:50,837
<b>Ha Jin will come to me in the end...</b>

45
00:03:52,537 --> 00:03:55,976
<b>once she finds out that you're
her best friend's boyfriend.</b>

46
00:04:01,147 --> 00:04:05,347
<b>I'm here to tell you
there's nothing you can do in there.</b>

47
00:04:07,587 --> 00:04:08,717
<b>Listen up.</b>

48
00:04:09,486 --> 00:04:13,256
<b>First of all, you'll be in prison
a lot longer than you think.</b>

49
00:04:13,356 --> 00:04:14,886
<b>I'll make that happen.</b>

50
00:04:20,397 --> 00:04:21,697
<b>Who do you think you are?</b>

51
00:04:24,996 --> 00:04:27,566
<b>No matter what you do,
I'll be released.</b>

52
00:04:28,306 --> 00:04:30,037
<b>The law works that way.</b>

53
00:04:31,507 --> 00:04:34,106
<b>There's no way
you can keep me here forever.</b>

54
00:04:34,106 --> 00:04:36,046
<b>Breaking and entering,
special violence,</b>

55
00:04:36,046 --> 00:04:37,476
<b>confinement, kidnapping...</b>

56
00:04:38,246 --> 00:04:40,546
<b>Those crimes may get you
three years in prison at most,</b>

57
00:04:41,486 --> 00:04:43,157
<b>maybe even less.</b>

58
00:04:44,186 --> 00:04:46,027
<b>But do you really think that's all?</b>

59
00:04:46,757 --> 00:04:47,827
<b>What are you trying to say?</b>

60
00:04:48,856 --> 00:04:50,796
<b>What if you approached
Moon Seong Ho,</b>

61
00:04:50,796 --> 00:04:52,726
<b>who was sentenced to life
for murder,</b>

62
00:04:52,866 --> 00:04:54,566
<b>figured out his methods,</b>

63
00:04:54,827 --> 00:04:57,397
<b>and tried to commit a copycat crime?</b>

64
00:04:58,496 --> 00:05:01,907
<b>How will the law, the press,
and public opinion...</b>

65
00:05:03,176 --> 00:05:04,507
<b>react to that?</b>

66
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:08,947
<b>I'm different from that murderer.</b>

67
00:05:09,416 --> 00:05:11,577
<b>All I wanted to do was
tell Ha Jin the truth...</b>

68
00:05:11,577 --> 00:05:13,887
<b>and vow our love.</b>

69
00:05:15,017 --> 00:05:16,887
<b>Do you think
people will believe that?</b>

70
00:05:18,717 --> 00:05:19,986
<b>That's just one of
those delusions...</b>

71
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:22,626
<b>lunatics like Moon Seong Ho
and you have.</b>

72
00:05:25,597 --> 00:05:27,767
<b>No, that's not true.</b>

73
00:05:28,397 --> 00:05:30,066
<b>Never!</b>

74
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:35,337
<b>Fine. You don't have to
either admit it...</b>

75
00:05:35,337 --> 00:05:37,037
<b>or apologize for it.</b>

76
00:05:38,476 --> 00:05:42,147
<b>Just watch your life
get destroyed in there.</b>

77
00:06:08,306 --> 00:06:09,537
<b>Hello, Anchor Lee.</b>

78
00:06:10,777 --> 00:06:12,077
<b>You were sleeping?</b>

79
00:06:13,546 --> 00:06:17,316
<b>This stuffed animal you gave me
is really effective.</b>

80
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:20,587
<b>I hugged it for a second
and fell asleep right away.</b>

81
00:06:22,087 --> 00:06:23,856
<b>I'm glad to hear that.</b>

82
00:06:24,856 --> 00:06:26,726
<b>Did you get home safely?</b>

83
00:06:26,726 --> 00:06:27,957
<b>Yes, I'm home now.</b>

84
00:06:28,426 --> 00:06:30,757
<b>It's so nice to be back home.</b>

85
00:06:31,356 --> 00:06:33,296
<b>Everything is finally over.</b>

86
00:06:35,226 --> 00:06:37,037
<b>Are you on your way to work?</b>

87
00:06:37,496 --> 00:06:39,537
<b>Yes, I am.</b>

88
00:06:40,507 --> 00:06:41,666
<b>Go back to sleep then.</b>

89
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:44,306
<b>Hold on.</b>

90
00:06:44,976 --> 00:06:47,546
<b>We can talk some more.
I've rested enough.</b>

91
00:06:49,717 --> 00:06:51,316
<b>Can we meet today?</b>

92
00:06:51,447 --> 00:06:53,616
<b>I really need your help
with my script.</b>

93
00:06:53,616 --> 00:06:55,087
<b>The read-through is coming up.</b>

94
00:06:56,757 --> 00:06:57,856
<b>All right.</b>

95
00:06:57,856 --> 00:07:01,157
<b>But on weekdays,
I can only meet after the news.</b>

96
00:07:01,356 --> 00:07:04,356
<b>Is that okay with you?
It'll be pretty late.</b>

97
00:07:04,626 --> 00:07:06,527
<b>Don't worry, I'm a night owl.</b>

98
00:07:07,197 --> 00:07:09,666
<b>Then shall we meet
after the news tonight?</b>

99
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:11,066
<b>I'll come to you.</b>

100
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:12,707
<b>Okay, let's do that.</b>

101
00:07:13,267 --> 00:07:15,606
<b>Drive safe. See you later.</b>

102
00:07:18,907 --> 00:07:20,277
<b>I don't have time for this.</b>

103
00:07:24,517 --> 00:07:26,147
<b>Sandwiches are here...</b>

104
00:07:30,986 --> 00:07:33,056
<b>What are you doing?
You're going somewhere?</b>

105
00:07:33,257 --> 00:07:35,726
<b>I'm meeting Anchor Lee
for some practice later.</b>

106
00:07:35,856 --> 00:07:38,126
<b>- When?
- After his news.</b>

107
00:07:38,126 --> 00:07:39,926
<b>It's only 10 a.m.</b>

108
00:07:39,926 --> 00:07:42,597
<b>You have 14 hours, and you're
already picking out an outfit?</b>

109
00:07:42,597 --> 00:07:44,467
<b>I want to get a head start.</b>

110
00:07:44,637 --> 00:07:46,436
<b>You're going to make a mess
for the next 14 hours, aren't you?</b>

111
00:07:48,606 --> 00:07:49,676
<b>The thing is...</b>

112
00:07:51,007 --> 00:07:52,037
<b>Come here.</b>

113
00:07:52,037 --> 00:07:53,847
<b>What? What is it now?</b>

114
00:07:57,447 --> 00:07:59,416
<b>It's happening for real.</b>

115
00:07:59,816 --> 00:08:00,816
<b>What do you mean?</b>

116
00:08:00,816 --> 00:08:03,157
<b>Anchor Lee and I are dating
for real now.</b>

117
00:08:04,486 --> 00:08:05,486
<b>You are?</b>

118
00:08:05,816 --> 00:08:07,186
<b>It's true.</b>

119
00:08:07,186 --> 00:08:10,157
<b>Sure. Just don't go overboard
and get dumped later.</b>

120
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:11,957
<b>I'm sure of it. Believe me.</b>

121
00:08:11,957 --> 00:08:13,327
<b>It's happening for real, I swear.</b>

122
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:17,236
<b>What are you doing with your lips?</b>

123
00:08:18,837 --> 00:08:20,907
<b>What? What happened between you two?</b>

124
00:08:22,566 --> 00:08:23,707
<b>You guys kissed?</b>

125
00:08:31,546 --> 00:08:32,717
<b>That hurts!</b>

126
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:37,716
<b>That's what happened.</b>

127
00:08:52,137 --> 00:08:53,936
<b>Are you in the lobby yet?</b>

128
00:08:54,537 --> 00:08:57,537
<b>The cafe in the lobby has
amazing honey black tea.</b>

129
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:00,306
<b>I highly recommend it.
Get a cup on your way.</b>

130
00:09:00,777 --> 00:09:02,676
<b>Have a nice day. See you later.</b>

131
00:09:03,617 --> 00:09:05,977
<b>I almost forgot.
If you run into Mr. Kim,</b>

132
00:09:05,977 --> 00:09:08,647
<b>please thank him for visiting me
in the hospital the other day.</b>

133
00:09:08,647 --> 00:09:10,357
<b>(Please thank him for visiting me
in the hospital the other day.)</b>

134
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:17,426
<b>Gosh, this is unbelievable.</b>

135
00:09:17,857 --> 00:09:20,166
<b>After all this wait,</b>

136
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:22,426
<b>you finally won his heart.</b>

137
00:09:22,997 --> 00:09:24,997
<b>It'd be more accurate to say...</b>

138
00:09:24,997 --> 00:09:27,607
<b>that Anchor Lee finally realized
his feelings.</b>

139
00:09:28,407 --> 00:09:30,277
<b>So? Are you happy?</b>

140
00:09:31,407 --> 00:09:32,607
<b>Yes, I really am.</b>

141
00:09:34,977 --> 00:09:37,916
<b>Right, weren't you and Mr. Jo
going to work out together?</b>

142
00:09:38,017 --> 00:09:39,716
<b>When are you starting?
Your shoulder is fine now.</b>

143
00:09:39,716 --> 00:09:41,387
<b>We're starting today.</b>

144
00:09:43,086 --> 00:09:44,387
<b>Be honest.</b>

145
00:09:44,956 --> 00:09:46,627
<b>Is something going on
between you two?</b>

146
00:09:47,056 --> 00:09:49,056
<b>What are you talking about?</b>

147
00:09:49,127 --> 00:09:52,497
<b>He got dumped because
he's too weak, so I'm helping him.</b>

148
00:09:53,027 --> 00:09:54,027
<b>Really?</b>

149
00:09:54,267 --> 00:09:57,166
<b>I think you two would make
a cute couple. Too bad.</b>

150
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:59,436
<b>Don't be ridiculous.</b>

151
00:10:01,436 --> 00:10:03,137
<b>Do you really think...</b>

152
00:10:04,306 --> 00:10:05,336
<b>we'd make a cute couple?</b>

153
00:10:06,306 --> 00:10:07,346
<b>He and I?</b>

154
00:10:07,676 --> 00:10:09,546
<b>Yes, I do.</b>

155
00:10:09,747 --> 00:10:10,777
<b>I see.</b>

156
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:13,416
<b>Well...</b>

157
00:10:14,117 --> 00:10:16,387
<b>Why? What makes you think so?</b>

158
00:10:18,857 --> 00:10:22,157
<b>You two have the ideal
height difference and all.</b>

159
00:10:23,096 --> 00:10:24,696
<b>What? Why are you asking?</b>

160
00:10:25,296 --> 00:10:26,997
<b>- I was just curious.
- Are you interested in him?</b>

161
00:10:26,997 --> 00:10:28,426
<b>Don't be ridiculous.</b>

162
00:10:28,426 --> 00:10:30,196
<b>- Why are you stuttering?
- It's not like that.</b>

163
00:10:30,196 --> 00:10:31,196
<b>Your voice is shaking.</b>

164
00:10:31,196 --> 00:10:32,637
<b>I said, no!</b>

165
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:36,066
<b>- Good morning.
- Good morning.</b>

166
00:10:38,877 --> 00:10:39,946
<b>Good morning, Anchor Lee.</b>

167
00:10:39,946 --> 00:10:41,107
<b>Good morning.</b>

168
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:45,977
<b>You look like you're in a good mood.
I'm devastated.</b>

169
00:10:48,517 --> 00:10:50,757
<b>What's wrong? Did something happen?</b>

170
00:10:50,757 --> 00:10:54,387
<b>Because he switched you out
the other day,</b>

171
00:10:54,627 --> 00:10:56,926
<b>he, you, and the director
will be disciplined.</b>

172
00:10:57,326 --> 00:10:59,997
<b>Not only me but you two as well?</b>

173
00:10:59,997 --> 00:11:01,127
<b>Unfortunately, yes.</b>

174
00:11:01,767 --> 00:11:05,566
<b>The news still has to air,
so you and I will be fine.</b>

175
00:11:05,596 --> 00:11:08,436
<b>But Director Choi will be suspended
until the disciplinary committee...</b>

176
00:11:08,436 --> 00:11:09,737
<b>makes a decision.</b>

177
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:12,507
<b>She's been told to stay
out of his office from today.</b>

178
00:11:13,446 --> 00:11:15,607
<b>What if she ends up getting fired?</b>

179
00:11:15,777 --> 00:11:17,377
<b>But why the director?</b>

180
00:11:17,716 --> 00:11:19,446
<b>I'm the one who is responsible for
what happened.</b>

181
00:11:19,446 --> 00:11:20,586
<b>It doesn't make sense.</b>

182
00:11:20,586 --> 00:11:22,316
<b>What do you mean,
it doesn't make sense?</b>

183
00:11:22,316 --> 00:11:25,586
<b>We switched the anchor out without
reporting it to the higher-ups.</b>

184
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:28,887
<b>Also, this isn't only about
what happened that day.</b>

185
00:11:28,887 --> 00:11:31,426
<b>Think of all the things
you've revealed...</b>

186
00:11:31,426 --> 00:11:35,426
<b>on the news so far,
ignoring the higher-ups.</b>

187
00:11:35,426 --> 00:11:37,737
<b>You've gotten on their wrong side.</b>

188
00:11:38,596 --> 00:11:40,637
<b>This is just an excuse
to bring you down.</b>

189
00:11:42,066 --> 00:11:43,477
<b>I'm sorry, Mr. Kim.</b>

190
00:11:44,176 --> 00:11:45,537
<b>Where is Director Choi now?</b>

191
00:11:53,387 --> 00:11:54,517
<b>Come in.</b>

192
00:11:56,387 --> 00:11:57,456
<b>Director Choi.</b>

193
00:12:03,796 --> 00:12:05,956
<b>Judging by your face,
I guess you heard the news.</b>

194
00:12:06,867 --> 00:12:09,637
<b>It's no big deal.
Don't worry and go back to work.</b>

195
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:11,666
<b>I apologize.</b>

196
00:12:13,537 --> 00:12:14,966
<b>For what?</b>

197
00:12:15,267 --> 00:12:18,507
<b>For trying to save someone close
to you who got kidnapped?</b>

198
00:12:18,607 --> 00:12:19,806
<b>Or is it because you left...</b>

199
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:24,176
<b>after only asking for my permission
instead of following protocol...</b>

200
00:12:25,277 --> 00:12:26,647
<b>and asking everyone in management?</b>

201
00:12:30,257 --> 00:12:34,086
<b>It was only a natural thing to do.
So why would you apologize?</b>

202
00:12:35,157 --> 00:12:38,397
<b>I caused you and
the team manager trouble.</b>

203
00:12:38,397 --> 00:12:41,426
<b>We switched the main anchor out
without any prior notice.</b>

204
00:12:41,426 --> 00:12:43,336
<b>We should take responsibility
for that.</b>

205
00:12:43,436 --> 00:12:47,206
<b>But that's it.
Don't read anything more into it.</b>

206
00:12:47,966 --> 00:12:51,576
<b>I'll try to explain it
to the president in person.</b>

207
00:12:51,576 --> 00:12:54,377
<b>Gosh, you talk too much.</b>

208
00:12:54,706 --> 00:12:56,877
<b>Don't you trust me?</b>

209
00:12:57,176 --> 00:13:00,086
<b>What are you talking about?
You know how much I look up to you.</b>

210
00:13:00,086 --> 00:13:03,186
<b>Then just let it go
when I tell you everything's cool.</b>

211
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:07,086
<b>Also, consider yourself lucky
to have an amazing boss like me,</b>

212
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:08,157
<b>okay?</b>

213
00:13:08,527 --> 00:13:11,127
<b>Besides, the disciplinary
committee's decision...</b>

214
00:13:11,127 --> 00:13:13,066
<b>will come in 3 or 4 days
at the latest.</b>

215
00:13:13,296 --> 00:13:16,596
<b>I think I'm going to take
this chance and take some time off.</b>

216
00:13:16,596 --> 00:13:18,897
<b>So leave me alone and get out.</b>

217
00:13:25,877 --> 00:13:27,306
<b>I'm sorry, Director Choi.</b>

218
00:13:28,107 --> 00:13:29,346
<b>All right.</b>

219
00:13:32,816 --> 00:13:34,346
<b>I love you, Director Choi.</b>

220
00:13:35,747 --> 00:13:36,816
<b>Thanks.</b>

221
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:48,666
<b>Gosh, I've never had a break before.</b>

222
00:13:49,426 --> 00:13:52,196
<b>I mean,
I rarely get to take a break.</b>

223
00:13:52,537 --> 00:13:54,936
<b>Why am I reading the newspaper? Why?</b>

224
00:13:54,936 --> 00:13:56,507
<b>Come on. Seriously.</b>

225
00:13:56,507 --> 00:13:58,137
<b>Goodness.</b>

226
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:02,946
<b>Ha Jin, are you ready to go?</b>

227
00:14:10,186 --> 00:14:11,916
<b>Don't tell me
that's what you're wearing.</b>

228
00:14:12,086 --> 00:14:13,186
<b>Is it too much?</b>

229
00:14:13,326 --> 00:14:16,326
<b>Yes, it is way too much.
It's like you're going...</b>

230
00:14:16,326 --> 00:14:17,657
<b>to an awards ceremony.</b>

231
00:14:18,326 --> 00:14:20,696
<b>I wanted to dress up
since it's our first date.</b>

232
00:14:20,696 --> 00:14:22,627
<b>Date? It's not a date.</b>

233
00:14:22,627 --> 00:14:24,267
<b>Isn't he helping you
with your lines?</b>

234
00:14:24,267 --> 00:14:25,497
<b>That's the same thing.</b>

235
00:14:25,596 --> 00:14:27,737
<b>I'll be professional while spending
time with him like a mature lady.</b>

236
00:14:27,737 --> 00:14:29,166
<b>I'll get the best of both worlds.</b>

237
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:31,436
<b>I doubt that Anchor Lee
will agree with you.</b>

238
00:14:31,836 --> 00:14:33,546
<b>- I should change, right?
- Of course.</b>

239
00:14:33,546 --> 00:14:35,007
<b>You look like a mix of apples
and strawberries.</b>

240
00:14:35,277 --> 00:14:37,916
<b>- I'll go change.
- Okay. Hurry.</b>

241
00:14:38,216 --> 00:14:39,446
<b>Be careful.</b>

242
00:14:39,446 --> 00:14:41,887
<b>Don't hurt yourself
on your first date with him.</b>

243
00:14:41,887 --> 00:14:42,946
<b>Okay!</b>

244
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:45,517
<b>I want to go work out.
Make it quick.</b>

245
00:14:45,517 --> 00:14:47,326
<b>No, be careful first.</b>

246
00:14:50,926 --> 00:14:52,096
<b>Where is she?</b>

247
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:55,166
<b>Hey, Chul Woong.</b>

248
00:14:55,566 --> 00:14:57,137
<b>Hey, have you seen Hee Sang?</b>

249
00:14:57,696 --> 00:15:00,237
<b>I saw her just now on the rooftop
when I went up to smoke.</b>

250
00:15:03,507 --> 00:15:05,507
<b>Where on earth is she?</b>

251
00:15:05,806 --> 00:15:07,206
<b>She was right here.</b>

252
00:15:07,676 --> 00:15:08,706
<b>There she is.</b>

253
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:13,387
<b>What? Is she crying?</b>

254
00:15:13,387 --> 00:15:15,316
<b>Go and try to comfort her.</b>

255
00:15:21,956 --> 00:15:23,056
<b>Sweetheart.</b>

256
00:15:24,027 --> 00:15:26,056
<b>Why are you crying out here?</b>

257
00:15:26,257 --> 00:15:27,426
<b>My gosh.</b>

258
00:15:30,367 --> 00:15:33,407
<b>Why do your shoulders look so small
from the back?</b>

259
00:15:35,137 --> 00:15:38,806
<b>You've been so strong for me,
so I have been taking the back seat.</b>

260
00:15:39,907 --> 00:15:41,647
<b>Now, I'll take the burdens...</b>

261
00:15:43,546 --> 00:15:44,846
<b>you've been shouldering.</b>

262
00:15:46,747 --> 00:15:50,287
<b>Goodness,
it must have been tough on you.</b>

263
00:15:50,657 --> 00:15:52,157
<b>Oh, poor you.</b>

264
00:15:55,227 --> 00:15:56,596
<b>Darn it.</b>

265
00:15:57,497 --> 00:15:59,966
<b>If the higher-ups give you a hard
time because of this incident,</b>

266
00:15:59,966 --> 00:16:01,566
<b>you should just resign.</b>

267
00:16:01,566 --> 00:16:04,137
<b>I'll be able to support you.</b>

268
00:16:07,206 --> 00:16:09,367
<b>You've been working so hard for us,</b>

269
00:16:11,037 --> 00:16:13,377
<b>so I'll take up your burdens now.</b>

270
00:16:15,607 --> 00:16:18,377
<b>Don't let this ruin your mood.</b>

271
00:16:19,316 --> 00:16:20,446
<b>Stop crying.</b>

272
00:16:21,517 --> 00:16:22,846
<b>Sweetheart.</b>

273
00:16:22,846 --> 00:16:23,857
<b>My gosh.</b>

274
00:16:25,216 --> 00:16:27,787
<b>When did you get here? You should've
told me if you were here.</b>

275
00:16:28,586 --> 00:16:31,027
<b>I did. I've been talking to you
all this time.</b>

276
00:16:31,127 --> 00:16:32,257
<b>Really?</b>

277
00:16:32,556 --> 00:16:35,166
<b>I probably didn't hear you
because of the earbuds.</b>

278
00:16:36,127 --> 00:16:39,037
<b>My goodness. This is so funny.</b>

279
00:16:39,737 --> 00:16:41,537
<b>I've been laughing so hard. Look.</b>

280
00:16:41,537 --> 00:16:43,336
<b>I'm literally crying.</b>

281
00:16:45,277 --> 00:16:47,046
<b>Were you watching this?</b>

282
00:16:47,147 --> 00:16:48,877
<b>While shaking your shoulders?</b>

283
00:16:49,477 --> 00:16:52,247
<b>I haven't seen this for a while,
so this is hilarious.</b>

284
00:16:53,517 --> 00:16:55,517
<b>- It's so funny.
- My gosh, Chul Woong.</b>

285
00:16:55,617 --> 00:16:56,787
<b>Look at you.</b>

286
00:16:59,056 --> 00:17:00,956
<b>By the way,
did you come up here to find me?</b>

287
00:17:00,956 --> 00:17:02,586
<b>Whatever!</b>

288
00:17:02,826 --> 00:17:04,096
<b>How could you be watching
a variety show now?</b>

289
00:17:04,096 --> 00:17:05,926
<b>You startled me.</b>

290
00:17:06,096 --> 00:17:08,267
<b>What else could I do?
I have nothing to do.</b>

291
00:17:08,267 --> 00:17:10,697
<b>And time is moving so slowly.
I need to entertain myself.</b>

292
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:11,866
<b>Fine, go ahead.</b>

293
00:17:11,866 --> 00:17:13,537
<b>You should catch up
with all the shows...</b>

294
00:17:13,537 --> 00:17:15,207
<b>you missed so far
now that you're suspended.</b>

295
00:17:15,207 --> 00:17:17,106
<b>Good for you. This all worked out.</b>

296
00:17:19,636 --> 00:17:20,846
<b>Shut it.</b>

297
00:17:23,747 --> 00:17:26,477
<b>My goodness, my husband
sure makes me feel safe.</b>

298
00:17:29,987 --> 00:17:31,116
<b>Darn it.</b>

299
00:17:34,126 --> 00:17:36,126
<b>Try again. This time,
pronounce them more clearly.</b>

300
00:17:39,626 --> 00:17:40,997
<b>Now, say your line.</b>

301
00:17:41,396 --> 00:17:42,727
<b>Korean conglomerates...</b>

302
00:17:42,727 --> 00:17:44,767
<b>No, I told you before.</b>

303
00:17:45,066 --> 00:17:46,967
<b>I want you to enunciate
one at a time.</b>

304
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:48,437
<b>Okay. Enunciate.</b>

305
00:17:49,836 --> 00:17:54,477
<b>Korean conglomerates.</b>

306
00:17:54,477 --> 00:17:57,017
<b>- Now, say them together.
- Korean conglomerates.</b>

307
00:17:57,247 --> 00:18:00,146
<b>That's good.
Let's move onto the next line.</b>

308
00:18:00,146 --> 00:18:02,247
<b>The first half
of their recruiting program.</b>

309
00:18:02,687 --> 00:18:04,187
<b>Pronounce the vowels 10 times again.</b>

310
00:18:05,517 --> 00:18:06,616
<b>10 times?</b>

311
00:18:06,787 --> 00:18:07,787
<b>Start.</b>

312
00:18:13,527 --> 00:18:14,727
<b>Enunciate.</b>

313
00:18:17,066 --> 00:18:18,467
<b>Slowly.</b>

314
00:18:24,606 --> 00:18:25,677
<b>I did it. 10 times.</b>

315
00:18:26,177 --> 00:18:27,177
<b>You're done?</b>

316
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:32,947
<b>Can we just use it
without permission?</b>

317
00:18:33,787 --> 00:18:35,586
<b>I already got
the coach's permission.</b>

318
00:18:35,586 --> 00:18:37,086
<b>We just have to clean up afterward.</b>

319
00:18:37,086 --> 00:18:38,856
<b>Here. Go put this on.</b>

320
00:18:39,687 --> 00:18:40,687
<b>Okay.</b>

321
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:44,156
<b>By the way, what are we doing here?</b>

322
00:18:46,967 --> 00:18:48,167
<b>Jujitsu.</b>

323
00:18:48,497 --> 00:18:50,096
<b>I've heard of it a lot.</b>

324
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:52,396
<b>But this isn't right, you know.</b>

325
00:18:52,636 --> 00:18:55,267
<b>- What do you mean?
- I get that I'm a first-timer.</b>

326
00:18:55,537 --> 00:18:57,937
<b>You know, there are
weight classes in fights.</b>

327
00:18:58,277 --> 00:19:00,777
<b>Jujitsu isn't a form of fighting.
It's martial arts.</b>

328
00:19:00,777 --> 00:19:02,306
<b>And this allows us to overcome
physical traits.</b>

329
00:19:02,306 --> 00:19:04,116
<b>But still, this won't work.</b>

330
00:19:04,116 --> 00:19:06,787
<b>I can't do this when I know
you won't be my match at all.</b>

331
00:19:06,787 --> 00:19:09,386
<b>Where are you? You know?
I can't see you.</b>

332
00:19:13,257 --> 00:19:15,856
<b>I told you this sport allows us
to overcome our physical traits.</b>

333
00:19:16,727 --> 00:19:18,457
<b>You ought to listen to people
to the end.</b>

334
00:19:18,596 --> 00:19:19,957
<b>Okay.</b>

335
00:19:19,957 --> 00:19:20,967
<b>Okay?</b>

336
00:19:20,967 --> 00:19:22,066
<b>Okay.</b>

337
00:19:22,296 --> 00:19:26,467
<b>Okay. Since it's your first day,
we'll stick to the basic moves.</b>

338
00:19:26,467 --> 00:19:27,836
<b>The basic moves?</b>

339
00:19:29,207 --> 00:19:31,207
<b>My back. My gosh.</b>

340
00:19:31,207 --> 00:19:32,777
<b>Hold on a second.</b>

341
00:19:32,777 --> 00:19:34,146
<b>I didn't start yet.</b>

342
00:19:34,146 --> 00:19:35,346
<b>But it already hurts.</b>

343
00:19:35,346 --> 00:19:36,747
<b>Hold on! Wait!</b>

344
00:19:36,747 --> 00:19:38,447
<b>Tap out. I'm tapping.</b>

345
00:19:38,447 --> 00:19:39,576
<b>Tap out.</b>

346
00:19:40,017 --> 00:19:41,046
<b>By cutting down...</b>

347
00:19:41,046 --> 00:19:42,687
<b>on their recruiting programs,
which were held twice a year,</b>

348
00:19:42,687 --> 00:19:44,356
<b>they increased the number of hires
by accepting resumes all year round.</b>

349
00:19:44,356 --> 00:19:46,616
<b>And this has led to confusion
for the job-seekers.</b>

350
00:19:47,656 --> 00:19:50,457
<b>You did well,
but your voice keeps going up.</b>

351
00:19:50,727 --> 00:19:54,396
<b>Try to lower your voice. It's lower
than the voice you have in mind.</b>

352
00:19:54,396 --> 00:19:56,027
<b>That way, your voice
will sound stable.</b>

353
00:19:56,396 --> 00:19:57,396
<b>Try again.</b>

354
00:19:57,697 --> 00:19:59,896
<b>- Again?
- One more time.</b>

355
00:20:01,007 --> 00:20:03,636
<b>You've been saying that
more than 50 times.</b>

356
00:20:05,136 --> 00:20:07,376
<b>This is boring.</b>

357
00:20:07,977 --> 00:20:09,177
<b>What are you doing?</b>

358
00:20:09,447 --> 00:20:10,447
<b>I knew it.</b>

359
00:20:11,046 --> 00:20:12,146
<b>There's a saying that
we shouldn't learn...</b>

360
00:20:12,146 --> 00:20:13,987
<b>to drive or to be an anchor
from the significant others.</b>

361
00:20:14,017 --> 00:20:15,747
<b>All the sayings were true.</b>

362
00:20:15,747 --> 00:20:17,757
<b>I've never heard of such a saying.</b>

363
00:20:19,017 --> 00:20:21,586
<b>Had I known how this would turn out,
I would've asked someone else.</b>

364
00:20:21,856 --> 00:20:25,096
<b>You sound like a scary, strict
teacher, not my boyfriend.</b>

365
00:20:25,096 --> 00:20:27,767
<b>Today, I'm not your boyfriend.
I'm your teacher.</b>

366
00:20:29,167 --> 00:20:32,197
<b>If I knew I would be reading lines,
I shouldn't have dressed up.</b>

367
00:20:32,366 --> 00:20:33,937
<b>I got excited for nothing.</b>

368
00:20:39,237 --> 00:20:41,277
<b>You give me no choice.
We need to dial it up a notch.</b>

369
00:20:42,477 --> 00:20:43,477
<b>Where are you going?</b>

370
00:20:43,977 --> 00:20:46,217
<b>Get your script and follow me.</b>

371
00:20:48,017 --> 00:20:49,017
<b>My gosh.</b>

372
00:20:51,116 --> 00:20:52,987
<b>We were already
practicing so hard here.</b>

373
00:21:08,566 --> 00:21:10,177
<b>Why are we in the studio?</b>

374
00:21:10,937 --> 00:21:12,306
<b>Sit down in the anchor's seat.</b>

375
00:21:13,136 --> 00:21:14,146
<b>Me?</b>

376
00:21:15,046 --> 00:21:16,677
<b>Practice as if it's real.</b>

377
00:21:17,247 --> 00:21:18,247
<b>Hurry.</b>

378
00:21:34,066 --> 00:21:36,767
<b>You look much better in that seat
than I expected.</b>

379
00:21:37,037 --> 00:21:38,037
<b>Really?</b>

380
00:21:41,836 --> 00:21:42,866
<b>All right.</b>

381
00:21:43,306 --> 00:21:44,576
<b>Square your shoulders.</b>

382
00:21:44,876 --> 00:21:46,677
<b>Keep your back straight.</b>

383
00:21:50,576 --> 00:21:53,417
<b>My outfit feels uncomfortable.
I can't get the right posture.</b>

384
00:21:53,417 --> 00:21:55,917
<b>What's the correct posture?
Help me one more time.</b>

385
00:22:00,287 --> 00:22:01,687
<b>Listen carefully.</b>

386
00:22:02,586 --> 00:22:03,896
<b>Square your shoulders.</b>

387
00:22:04,227 --> 00:22:06,156
<b>Keep your back straight.</b>

388
00:22:07,396 --> 00:22:08,396
<b>Okay?</b>

389
00:22:08,826 --> 00:22:09,826
<b>Okay.</b>

390
00:22:11,096 --> 00:22:13,737
<b>Think about what we practiced.</b>

391
00:22:13,737 --> 00:22:14,866
<b>And give it a try.</b>

392
00:22:15,336 --> 00:22:17,237
<b>Try to remember
your breathing points.</b>

393
00:22:17,237 --> 00:22:20,477
<b>Now that I'm in a new environment,
I can focus better. It's nice.</b>

394
00:22:20,477 --> 00:22:22,677
<b>Since I'm focused,
let me practice other scenes.</b>

395
00:22:22,677 --> 00:22:24,017
<b>Help me.</b>

396
00:22:24,376 --> 00:22:26,477
<b>Other scenes? Which one?</b>

397
00:22:26,477 --> 00:22:27,947
<b>Scene 35.</b>

398
00:22:27,947 --> 00:22:29,947
<b>You're not leading the news
in that scene.</b>

399
00:22:30,457 --> 00:22:32,457
<b>This is a very important scene.</b>

400
00:22:32,457 --> 00:22:34,126
<b>You need to help me.</b>

401
00:22:34,126 --> 00:22:36,556
<b>You just have to read lines for me.</b>

402
00:22:36,997 --> 00:22:39,126
<b>Let's start from there. Hurry.</b>

403
00:22:43,527 --> 00:22:44,796
<b>Okay.</b>

404
00:22:46,336 --> 00:22:48,566
<b>"It was as if
I've been bewitched today."</b>

405
00:22:48,566 --> 00:22:51,677
<b>"I have been following traces
of you all day today."</b>

406
00:22:51,677 --> 00:22:55,846
<b>"It felt like some force was
stopping us from seeing each other."</b>

407
00:22:55,846 --> 00:22:58,247
<b>What was that? Are you a robot?</b>

408
00:22:58,417 --> 00:23:00,017
<b>You didn't put
any emotions into that.</b>

409
00:23:01,187 --> 00:23:03,517
<b>I thought you just needed me
to read the lines.</b>

410
00:23:03,517 --> 00:23:06,187
<b>You need to read with your emotions
for me to get into my character.</b>

411
00:23:06,556 --> 00:23:08,386
<b>Try to sound more sorrowful.
Try it again.</b>

412
00:23:12,396 --> 00:23:14,796
<b>"It was as if..."</b>

413
00:23:15,767 --> 00:23:17,697
<b>"It was as if
I've been bewitched today."</b>

414
00:23:17,697 --> 00:23:20,306
<b>"I have been following traces
of you all day today."</b>

415
00:23:21,967 --> 00:23:23,636
<b>Relax and try again.</b>

416
00:23:31,376 --> 00:23:33,247
<b>"It was as if
I've been bewitched today."</b>

417
00:23:33,247 --> 00:23:36,187
<b>"I have been following traces
of you all day today."</b>

418
00:23:44,396 --> 00:23:46,427
<b>All right. I'm sorry about that.</b>

419
00:23:46,757 --> 00:23:48,267
<b>Let's call it a day.</b>

420
00:23:48,896 --> 00:23:51,167
<b>I'm so glad
I didn't become an anchor,</b>

421
00:23:51,167 --> 00:23:52,967
<b>and I'm also very glad
you didn't get into acting.</b>

422
00:23:52,967 --> 00:23:54,336
<b>You're an awful actor.</b>

423
00:23:55,007 --> 00:23:56,066
<b>Agreed.</b>

424
00:23:57,636 --> 00:24:00,576
<b>What do you think will happen to
this drama? Will it be a big hit?</b>

425
00:24:00,777 --> 00:24:04,846
<b>I'm not sure. I don't know
a lot about dramas,</b>

426
00:24:05,217 --> 00:24:06,477
<b>but it's a little...</b>

427
00:24:06,477 --> 00:24:07,586
<b>It's a little what?</b>

428
00:24:07,646 --> 00:24:10,556
<b>It's a little far-fetched.</b>

429
00:24:10,987 --> 00:24:12,717
<b>What's far-fetched?</b>

430
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:14,156
<b>There are a lot of things,</b>

431
00:24:14,826 --> 00:24:17,156
<b>but especially the scene
where the man and the woman reunite.</b>

432
00:24:18,296 --> 00:24:21,167
<b>They run into each other three times
on the same day in the same place,</b>

433
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:25,136
<b>then they miss each other by a hair.</b>

434
00:24:25,967 --> 00:24:29,566
<b>Then they get into
a ridiculous accident on a street.</b>

435
00:24:29,806 --> 00:24:32,207
<b>Don't you think there are
way too many coincidences?</b>

436
00:24:32,207 --> 00:24:33,906
<b>That's why they're meant to be.</b>

437
00:24:34,906 --> 00:24:37,146
<b>They're destined to meet each other
and fall in love.</b>

438
00:24:38,546 --> 00:24:41,717
<b>And I'm sure more dramatic things
happen in our reality.</b>

439
00:24:42,046 --> 00:24:45,217
<b>Think of us. We didn't know
we'd end up like this.</b>

440
00:24:48,257 --> 00:24:49,257
<b>You're right.</b>

441
00:24:51,596 --> 00:24:54,126
<b>It's pretty late. Let's go.
You said you have work tomorrow.</b>

442
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:56,697
<b>That's true.</b>

443
00:24:57,467 --> 00:24:58,836
<b>But this is pretty disappointing.</b>

444
00:24:59,467 --> 00:25:02,066
<b>I didn't think we'd spend
our first date working.</b>

445
00:25:04,437 --> 00:25:06,677
<b>I didn't think
this was our first date.</b>

446
00:25:06,836 --> 00:25:07,947
<b>Then?</b>

447
00:25:09,277 --> 00:25:12,146
<b>I can't count
meeting you this briefly as a date.</b>

448
00:25:13,747 --> 00:25:15,447
<b>We need to have
a really good first date.</b>

449
00:25:16,316 --> 00:25:18,257
<b>Let's go on an official date
this weekend.</b>

450
00:25:20,217 --> 00:25:21,257
<b>Sounds great.</b>

451
00:25:22,987 --> 00:25:26,326
<b>Oh, right.
You have to grant me a wish.</b>

452
00:25:26,626 --> 00:25:28,796
<b>You said you're sorry
while we read the script.</b>

453
00:25:29,866 --> 00:25:31,997
<b>What? I don't remember that.</b>

454
00:25:32,796 --> 00:25:33,967
<b>You can't pull that on me.</b>

455
00:25:37,677 --> 00:25:40,007
<b>Fine. What's your wish?</b>

456
00:25:42,507 --> 00:25:43,947
<b>You'll find out soon enough.</b>

457
00:25:45,576 --> 00:25:47,546
<b>You're suddenly making me anxious.</b>

458
00:26:02,096 --> 00:26:03,167
<b>Doesn't it hurt?</b>

459
00:26:03,296 --> 00:26:04,497
<b>What are you doing?</b>

460
00:26:05,267 --> 00:26:07,207
<b>I'm doing as I'm told.</b>

461
00:26:08,937 --> 00:26:09,967
<b>Goodness.</b>

462
00:26:29,126 --> 00:26:31,927
<b>This is how you pull off the move.
Got it?</b>

463
00:26:38,836 --> 00:26:40,037
<b>Are you all right?</b>

464
00:26:50,646 --> 00:26:51,876
<b>Are you hurt?</b>

465
00:26:52,677 --> 00:26:54,517
<b>I think I hurt my head.</b>

466
00:26:54,717 --> 00:26:56,046
<b>Your head? When?</b>

467
00:27:04,997 --> 00:27:06,027
<b>Hey, Ha Jin.</b>

468
00:27:07,056 --> 00:27:08,927
<b>You're already leaving
on Anchor Lee's car?</b>

469
00:27:09,967 --> 00:27:11,066
<b>Okay.</b>

470
00:27:13,237 --> 00:27:14,866
<b>This is great.
I was craving a drink.</b>

471
00:27:15,037 --> 00:27:17,876
<b>Excuse me! One gizzard
and a bottle of soju, please.</b>

472
00:27:17,876 --> 00:27:18,876
<b>Sure.</b>

473
00:27:19,876 --> 00:27:22,146
<b>Do you want some soda?</b>

474
00:27:22,376 --> 00:27:25,116
<b>What are you talking about?
I'm a good drinker.</b>

475
00:27:25,917 --> 00:27:29,287
<b>Excuse me! Can we have
a soju glass and a regular glass?</b>

476
00:27:29,287 --> 00:27:30,316
<b>Sure.</b>

477
00:27:36,027 --> 00:27:37,086
<b>Have a drink.</b>

478
00:27:46,896 --> 00:27:48,806
<b>- Cheers.
- Cheers.</b>

479
00:27:56,106 --> 00:27:59,546
<b>That's sweet. A drink you have
after your workout is the sweetest.</b>

480
00:27:59,546 --> 00:28:00,947
<b>It's far from sweet.</b>

481
00:28:00,947 --> 00:28:03,316
<b>You haven't worked out enough, then.</b>

482
00:28:03,316 --> 00:28:05,086
<b>I went easy on you today
since it was your first day.</b>

483
00:28:05,086 --> 00:28:07,487
<b>You can expect more from now on.
We'll work out for real.</b>

484
00:28:08,086 --> 00:28:09,527
<b>You went easy on me today?</b>

485
00:28:09,527 --> 00:28:10,997
<b>Don't say that.</b>

486
00:28:10,997 --> 00:28:13,457
<b>You have to do your best
to get your revenge on your ex.</b>

487
00:28:16,866 --> 00:28:19,336
<b>Why are you rushing? Take your time.</b>

488
00:28:19,336 --> 00:28:21,707
<b>I can totally handle my drinks.</b>

489
00:28:23,737 --> 00:28:25,537
<b>Don't worry about me.</b>

490
00:28:26,977 --> 00:28:28,007
<b>Sure.</b>

491
00:28:33,517 --> 00:28:34,846
<b>I don't think so.</b>

492
00:28:35,187 --> 00:28:39,156
<b>Ha Kyung, don't you
want to become an athlete?</b>

493
00:28:39,517 --> 00:28:43,156
<b>I was an athlete in high school.
I played judo.</b>

494
00:28:43,257 --> 00:28:45,596
<b>I knew it!</b>

495
00:28:46,126 --> 00:28:47,497
<b>Why did you quit?</b>

496
00:28:47,997 --> 00:28:50,167
<b>At first, it was
because of an injury,</b>

497
00:28:50,467 --> 00:28:52,697
<b>but now, it's because of my sister.</b>

498
00:28:53,167 --> 00:28:55,007
<b>I thought I should be by her side.</b>

499
00:28:56,836 --> 00:29:00,277
<b>Then did you give up on your dream
because of Ha Jin?</b>

500
00:29:01,247 --> 00:29:03,346
<b>You two are very loving sisters.</b>

501
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:06,947
<b>But you two do look that loving.</b>

502
00:29:07,316 --> 00:29:10,116
<b>It's also my dream
to live happily with my family.</b>

503
00:29:11,816 --> 00:29:14,027
<b>We don't live with our parents,</b>

504
00:29:14,257 --> 00:29:17,656
<b>but it's still fun to live
hand in hand with my sister.</b>

505
00:29:18,126 --> 00:29:21,267
<b>Sometimes she doesn't listen to me
and gets in trouble,</b>

506
00:29:21,566 --> 00:29:25,136
<b>then I'd get angry and upset,</b>

507
00:29:25,737 --> 00:29:29,106
<b>but we still have a laugh
and make great memories.</b>

508
00:29:30,066 --> 00:29:31,836
<b>Every day is...</b>

509
00:29:34,346 --> 00:29:37,616
<b>What is this? Mr. Jo. Mr. Jo?</b>

510
00:29:38,146 --> 00:29:40,717
<b>I was just telling a serious story.</b>

511
00:29:41,417 --> 00:29:43,247
<b>Hey, Jo Il Kwon! Hey!</b>

512
00:29:43,747 --> 00:29:45,217
<b>Are you doing this to avoid paying?</b>

513
00:29:47,187 --> 00:29:50,556
<b>Hey! Get up. Hey. Hey!</b>

514
00:29:52,596 --> 00:29:54,066
<b>This guy is really out.</b>

515
00:29:59,167 --> 00:30:02,636
<b>"I can handle my drinks"?
My foot. You're such a weak drinker.</b>

516
00:30:05,737 --> 00:30:09,947
<b>This is weird.
It doesn't feel like I'm walking.</b>

517
00:30:09,977 --> 00:30:11,376
<b>Be quiet. It's already tough enough.</b>

518
00:30:17,656 --> 00:30:18,987
<b>Something smells.</b>

519
00:30:19,687 --> 00:30:20,787
<b>What's this smell?</b>

520
00:30:20,787 --> 00:30:22,156
<b>Shut up, you idiot!</b>

521
00:30:24,156 --> 00:30:25,326
<b>I don't feel good.</b>

522
00:30:25,697 --> 00:30:27,596
<b>I'm never drinking with you again.</b>

523
00:30:38,037 --> 00:30:39,237
<b>Man, that was tough.</b>

524
00:30:42,146 --> 00:30:43,277
<b>That was tough.</b>

525
00:30:47,217 --> 00:30:49,846
<b>You're so tiny and cute.</b>

526
00:30:57,787 --> 00:30:59,627
<b>Thanks for making time for me.</b>

527
00:31:00,297 --> 00:31:01,327
<b>Don't mention it.</b>

528
00:31:01,856 --> 00:31:02,967
<b>How's the result?</b>

529
00:31:02,967 --> 00:31:04,826
<b>No one would find any difference...</b>

530
00:31:04,826 --> 00:31:06,836
<b>even if we switched this
with the previous result.</b>

531
00:31:07,666 --> 00:31:09,767
<b>There are no new anomalies.</b>

532
00:31:09,767 --> 00:31:11,306
<b>Everything looks clean.</b>

533
00:31:11,306 --> 00:31:14,837
<b>Just think of this
as your regular checkup.</b>

534
00:31:14,837 --> 00:31:17,677
<b>I mean, some people
put aside time to do this.</b>

535
00:31:18,377 --> 00:31:20,916
<b>- All right.
- Do you have some time today?</b>

536
00:31:21,217 --> 00:31:22,947
<b>Yes, I can spare some time.</b>

537
00:31:23,747 --> 00:31:26,116
<b>Then let's have a chat for once.</b>

538
00:31:33,957 --> 00:31:37,266
<b>When did we first meet?</b>

539
00:31:39,527 --> 00:31:42,637
<b>October 17, 1995.</b>

540
00:31:43,266 --> 00:31:44,866
<b>It was a rainy Tuesday.</b>

541
00:31:45,266 --> 00:31:47,006
<b>When you were young,</b>

542
00:31:47,006 --> 00:31:49,506
<b>you were the most scared of...</b>

543
00:31:49,946 --> 00:31:52,376
<b>getting locked up in your closet.</b>

544
00:31:52,376 --> 00:31:54,076
<b>Are you still scared of that?</b>

545
00:31:55,476 --> 00:31:59,586
<b>Dad, I'm sorry.</b>

546
00:31:59,586 --> 00:32:03,486
<b>Please open this. Dad.</b>

547
00:32:03,986 --> 00:32:05,057
<b>Lee Jeong Hoon!</b>

548
00:32:05,227 --> 00:32:06,596
<b>Why won't you listen to me?</b>

549
00:32:06,757 --> 00:32:09,826
<b>Dad, I'm sorry.</b>

550
00:32:10,897 --> 00:32:12,926
<b>Please let me out.</b>

551
00:32:12,926 --> 00:32:13,936
<b>Be quiet!</b>

552
00:32:16,036 --> 00:32:17,266
<b>Dad!</b>

553
00:32:17,867 --> 00:32:21,137
<b>Dad! Dad!</b>

554
00:32:21,137 --> 00:32:22,137
<b>Yes.</b>

555
00:32:22,777 --> 00:32:24,576
<b>I know it's embarrassing, but I am.</b>

556
00:32:28,316 --> 00:32:30,516
<b>What about regarding Seo Yeon?</b>

557
00:32:31,647 --> 00:32:37,126
<b>Are your memories and feelings
about her the same?</b>

558
00:32:51,467 --> 00:32:54,807
<b>The images
are still very vivid to me.</b>

559
00:32:55,337 --> 00:32:56,947
<b>I see.</b>

560
00:32:57,546 --> 00:32:58,947
<b>To be honest,</b>

561
00:32:59,947 --> 00:33:02,816
<b>I was meaning to ask you this
for some time now.</b>

562
00:33:03,417 --> 00:33:06,856
<b>But I felt hesitant to ask
about your private life.</b>

563
00:33:07,487 --> 00:33:09,316
<b>That's okay.</b>

564
00:33:10,027 --> 00:33:13,226
<b>Is it true
that you and Yeo Ha Jin...</b>

565
00:33:13,927 --> 00:33:16,297
<b>are in a serious relationship?</b>

566
00:33:18,927 --> 00:33:21,536
<b>Yes, it's true.</b>

567
00:33:22,337 --> 00:33:25,237
<b>But you'll never be able
to forget Seo Yeon.</b>

568
00:33:25,906 --> 00:33:30,307
<b>How could you start
a new relationship in that state?</b>

569
00:33:30,506 --> 00:33:31,876
<b>Is it actually possible?</b>

570
00:33:34,147 --> 00:33:37,346
<b>I'm just surprised, that's all.</b>

571
00:33:39,487 --> 00:33:40,617
<b>I'm going to try to work it out.</b>

572
00:33:42,517 --> 00:33:44,686
<b>She's someone dear to me.</b>

573
00:33:46,656 --> 00:33:50,427
<b>I don't want to live
the rest of my life in regret.</b>

574
00:33:52,267 --> 00:33:53,267
<b>Is that so?</b>

575
00:33:54,237 --> 00:33:55,237
<b>All right.</b>

576
00:33:55,666 --> 00:33:59,207
<b>You look happy, so I'm relieved.</b>

577
00:34:01,006 --> 00:34:02,036
<b>I'm glad.</b>

578
00:34:03,006 --> 00:34:04,006
<b>Thank you.</b>

579
00:34:08,747 --> 00:34:10,017
<b>What do you think?</b>

580
00:34:10,017 --> 00:34:15,316
<b>("The Man Who Cannot Forget")</b>

581
00:34:15,316 --> 00:34:16,987
<b>I like this one the best.</b>

582
00:34:17,386 --> 00:34:20,596
<b>Okay, we'll use this.</b>

583
00:34:20,596 --> 00:34:21,596
<b>All right.</b>

584
00:34:22,196 --> 00:34:24,827
<b>How long will it take
to finalize your manuscript?</b>

585
00:34:24,827 --> 00:34:27,936
<b>Well, I think I'll need
a few more weeks.</b>

586
00:34:27,936 --> 00:34:29,036
<b>Oh, right.</b>

587
00:34:30,036 --> 00:34:32,307
<b>You wrote about a patient.</b>

588
00:34:32,307 --> 00:34:35,177
<b>The renowned news anchor
who suffers from hyperthymesia.</b>

589
00:34:35,307 --> 00:34:37,677
<b>I can understand
that you can't reveal his name,</b>

590
00:34:37,677 --> 00:34:40,717
<b>but it would be nice
to offer more details about him.</b>

591
00:34:40,777 --> 00:34:42,747
<b>I think
it's already detailed enough.</b>

592
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:46,856
<b>There are two factors that'll grab
your readers' attention.</b>

593
00:34:47,017 --> 00:34:48,916
<b>One, the fact
that he's a real-life individual.</b>

594
00:34:49,217 --> 00:34:52,386
<b>Two, the fact
that due to his illness,</b>

595
00:34:52,386 --> 00:34:55,756
<b>he's still living in pain
from the memories of his first love.</b>

596
00:34:56,226 --> 00:34:57,867
<b>And for eight years, at that.</b>

597
00:34:58,166 --> 00:35:00,596
<b>When I had first read
your manuscript,</b>

598
00:35:00,596 --> 00:35:02,596
<b>an individual came to my mind.</b>

599
00:35:02,737 --> 00:35:03,837
<b>Anchor Lee Jeong Hoon.</b>

600
00:35:04,106 --> 00:35:07,936
<b>But we all know
that he's dating Yeo Ha Jin.</b>

601
00:35:08,777 --> 00:35:13,007
<b>In that case, I can't think
of anyone else.</b>

602
00:35:13,846 --> 00:35:16,077
<b>I'm afraid your readers
will find it odd as well.</b>

603
00:35:24,187 --> 00:35:26,027
<b>You must be busy.
You should head back in.</b>

604
00:35:26,356 --> 00:35:27,827
<b>Good work today.</b>

605
00:35:27,827 --> 00:35:29,056
<b>- I'll call you.
- Sure.</b>

606
00:35:35,796 --> 00:35:37,337
<b>You can't do that.</b>

607
00:35:38,467 --> 00:35:41,536
<b>How could you date someone new?</b>

608
00:35:41,877 --> 00:35:43,176
<b>That's not right.</b>

609
00:35:45,346 --> 00:35:47,277
<b>You aren't capable of doing that.</b>

610
00:35:50,447 --> 00:35:53,356
<b>But you'll never be able
to forget Seo Yeon.</b>

611
00:35:54,017 --> 00:35:57,827
<b>How could you start
a new relationship in that state?</b>

612
00:35:57,827 --> 00:35:59,257
<b>Is it actually possible?</b>

613
00:36:04,627 --> 00:36:05,767
<b>Hey, Tae Eun.</b>

614
00:36:08,067 --> 00:36:09,267
<b>What do you think?</b>

615
00:36:09,267 --> 00:36:12,337
<b>It suits you. Not only will you be
the nation's first love...</b>

616
00:36:12,337 --> 00:36:14,137
<b>but also the nation's news anchor.</b>

617
00:36:14,207 --> 00:36:15,806
<b>- Really?
- Yes.</b>

618
00:36:15,806 --> 00:36:17,377
<b>Why don't we take a photo?</b>

619
00:36:17,377 --> 00:36:18,806
<b>Sure, that'd be lovely.</b>

620
00:36:18,806 --> 00:36:21,717
<b>Let's take a photo to commemorate
your first lead role.</b>

621
00:36:22,176 --> 00:36:24,387
<b>Try this on. Let's create a theme.</b>

622
00:36:24,387 --> 00:36:26,187
<b>Why would I wear your clothes?
Forget it.</b>

623
00:36:26,187 --> 00:36:28,286
<b>Come on, I think
it'll look good on you. Go on.</b>

624
00:36:28,517 --> 00:36:31,587
<b>Ms. Park, try this on.</b>

625
00:36:31,687 --> 00:36:33,757
<b>Oh, please. It won't even fit.</b>

626
00:36:33,757 --> 00:36:34,856
<b>Come on.</b>

627
00:36:35,056 --> 00:36:37,967
<b>Should I give it a try?
I do like the color.</b>

628
00:36:37,967 --> 00:36:39,827
<b>It looks good on you.</b>

629
00:36:39,827 --> 00:36:42,536
<b>You look wonderful. Put yours on.</b>

630
00:36:42,536 --> 00:36:44,767
<b>It's okay.
I'll take a photo of you two.</b>

631
00:36:44,767 --> 00:36:46,437
<b>Let's take it together.</b>

632
00:36:46,437 --> 00:36:47,937
<b>Hurry up and pose.</b>

633
00:36:48,106 --> 00:36:49,806
<b>It's going to be one-take.</b>

634
00:36:50,546 --> 00:36:51,606
<b>Okay.</b>

635
00:36:52,846 --> 00:36:54,046
<b>That's good.</b>

636
00:36:54,476 --> 00:36:56,116
<b>You look great.</b>

637
00:36:58,947 --> 00:36:59,986
<b>Done.</b>

638
00:36:59,986 --> 00:37:01,317
<b>- It came out nicely.
- Let me see.</b>

639
00:37:01,317 --> 00:37:02,317
<b>Look.</b>

640
00:37:04,426 --> 00:37:06,056
<b>Look at how pretty we look.</b>

641
00:37:06,056 --> 00:37:07,327
<b>You're right.</b>

642
00:37:07,796 --> 00:37:09,226
<b>Ms. Park, you got a call.</b>

643
00:37:09,356 --> 00:37:11,327
<b>Oh, dear. I completely forgot.</b>

644
00:37:11,327 --> 00:37:13,596
<b>I have a meeting to attend.</b>

645
00:37:13,596 --> 00:37:14,866
<b>Ma'am, the jacket.</b>

646
00:37:14,866 --> 00:37:16,067
<b>Right.</b>

647
00:37:17,267 --> 00:37:19,306
<b>- Bye, then.
- Goodbye.</b>

648
00:37:20,606 --> 00:37:21,976
<b>Try that one on.</b>

649
00:37:22,337 --> 00:37:24,106
<b>- This yellow one?
- Yes.</b>

650
00:37:24,746 --> 00:37:25,947
<b>Did you leave...</b>

651
00:37:30,346 --> 00:37:31,717
<b>Get out this instant!</b>

652
00:37:32,317 --> 00:37:33,356
<b>Chul.</b>

653
00:37:37,327 --> 00:37:38,486
<b>I'm truly sorry.</b>

654
00:37:40,426 --> 00:37:41,697
<b>I really am.</b>

655
00:37:41,697 --> 00:37:44,666
<b>How dare you come here?
Do you have no shame?</b>

656
00:37:44,866 --> 00:37:46,937
<b>I know that I can't be forgiven.</b>

657
00:37:48,166 --> 00:37:51,236
<b>But I couldn't deal with the guilt,
so I decided to come here.</b>

658
00:37:52,166 --> 00:37:53,637
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

659
00:37:53,837 --> 00:37:55,207
<b>This won't work.</b>

660
00:37:55,676 --> 00:37:57,746
<b>I know you just want us
to lessen your punishment.</b>

661
00:37:57,746 --> 00:37:59,377
<b>That's not true.</b>

662
00:37:59,377 --> 00:38:02,517
<b>I'm just here to sincerely apologize
for what I've done.</b>

663
00:38:03,277 --> 00:38:04,416
<b>I'm truly sorry.</b>

664
00:38:05,046 --> 00:38:07,116
<b>I couldn't handle the debt.</b>

665
00:38:07,486 --> 00:38:09,887
<b>- The debt?
- My father suddenly passed away,</b>

666
00:38:10,257 --> 00:38:12,986
<b>and his debt kept increasing
no matter how much I tried.</b>

667
00:38:19,327 --> 00:38:20,666
<b>About Chul...</b>

668
00:38:21,067 --> 00:38:23,837
<b>Don't you dare mention lessening
his punishment. That's absurd.</b>

669
00:38:24,007 --> 00:38:26,036
<b>But I feel bad for him.</b>

670
00:38:26,036 --> 00:38:27,806
<b>You know he's a goodhearted kid.</b>

671
00:38:28,937 --> 00:38:31,846
<b>What kind of a goodhearted person
deceives and steals from others?</b>

672
00:38:32,507 --> 00:38:34,616
<b>He seems to be repenting a lot.</b>

673
00:38:35,676 --> 00:38:37,947
<b>How will his family manage
if he's put behind bars?</b>

674
00:38:37,947 --> 00:38:40,687
<b>I'm not buying it.
Don't you ever mention him again.</b>

675
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:52,267
<b>I guess my father called you over.</b>

676
00:38:53,127 --> 00:38:54,166
<b>Yes.</b>

677
00:38:54,967 --> 00:38:58,437
<b>Next time he calls, say no.
You don't have to listen to him.</b>

678
00:38:59,007 --> 00:39:00,337
<b>But I have to listen to you?</b>

679
00:39:01,877 --> 00:39:04,277
<b>No, you don't have
to listen to me either.</b>

680
00:39:04,507 --> 00:39:07,046
<b>When you were young, hypnotherapy,</b>

681
00:39:07,046 --> 00:39:10,217
<b>medication, and counseling may have
helped you, but not anymore.</b>

682
00:39:10,517 --> 00:39:14,587
<b>Your determination
is what put you here.</b>

683
00:39:15,416 --> 00:39:18,527
<b>You need neither my father
nor my help anymore.</b>

684
00:39:18,786 --> 00:39:20,426
<b>So don't listen to us.</b>

685
00:39:21,226 --> 00:39:23,296
<b>There's nothing difficult
about receiving a checkup.</b>

686
00:39:24,596 --> 00:39:26,937
<b>And I'll be forever grateful to him.</b>

687
00:39:27,467 --> 00:39:28,837
<b>That'll never change.</b>

688
00:39:32,337 --> 00:39:34,907
<b>So was the checkup
all that you received?</b>

689
00:39:34,907 --> 00:39:36,337
<b>Did he have any other questions?</b>

690
00:39:37,646 --> 00:39:39,307
<b>He asked about Ha Jin.</b>

691
00:39:41,177 --> 00:39:43,016
<b>He asked if we were serious.</b>

692
00:39:45,287 --> 00:39:47,217
<b>He had asked me
several times before.</b>

693
00:39:48,087 --> 00:39:51,457
<b>I think he's been watching the news.
You don't have to explain it to him.</b>

694
00:39:53,187 --> 00:39:55,596
<b>We are in a serious relationship.</b>

695
00:39:57,896 --> 00:40:00,136
<b>What do you mean?</b>

696
00:40:00,366 --> 00:40:01,537
<b>It's exactly what I said.</b>

697
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:05,266
<b>Don't you know her condition?</b>

698
00:40:05,407 --> 00:40:07,876
<b>Her memories might come back...</b>

699
00:40:07,876 --> 00:40:10,106
<b>if you remain by her side.</b>

700
00:40:10,447 --> 00:40:12,646
<b>I know. I know that.</b>

701
00:40:14,016 --> 00:40:16,276
<b>But I don't want to shun her
because of that.</b>

702
00:40:17,187 --> 00:40:18,646
<b>Even if her memories come back
and she struggles,</b>

703
00:40:18,646 --> 00:40:20,157
<b>I'm going to be there for her.</b>

704
00:40:24,157 --> 00:40:26,327
<b>I've given this a lot of thought.</b>

705
00:40:29,957 --> 00:40:33,266
<b>Among all the decisions
you've made to this day,</b>

706
00:40:33,896 --> 00:40:36,096
<b>I had never gone against any.</b>

707
00:40:36,866 --> 00:40:39,807
<b>Because you were
a cautious and wise individual.</b>

708
00:40:40,407 --> 00:40:43,577
<b>But not this time.</b>

709
00:40:44,407 --> 00:40:46,177
<b>You don't seem like
the Jeong Hoon I know.</b>

710
00:40:47,376 --> 00:40:49,516
<b>That's because I did change.</b>

711
00:40:51,787 --> 00:40:53,856
<b>I'm not going
to hide in fear anymore.</b>

712
00:41:00,957 --> 00:41:04,766
<b>Doctor, Ms. Oh Mi Young
is waiting for you.</b>

713
00:41:06,327 --> 00:41:08,596
<b>I'll let you go back to work.
I'll call you.</b>

714
00:41:19,006 --> 00:41:23,146
<b>Oh, hi. How's the hangover?</b>

715
00:41:24,717 --> 00:41:27,986
<b>It's fine,
but I don't remember much.</b>

716
00:41:28,587 --> 00:41:30,427
<b>How did I go home?</b>

717
00:41:30,587 --> 00:41:33,256
<b>I carried you home, of course.</b>

718
00:41:33,626 --> 00:41:34,756
<b>Seriously?</b>

719
00:41:35,256 --> 00:41:38,596
<b>How could you have carried me
with that tiny body of yours?</b>

720
00:41:39,967 --> 00:41:43,537
<b>Don't you ever boast
about drinking well, got it?</b>

721
00:41:44,337 --> 00:41:45,407
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

722
00:41:45,967 --> 00:41:48,307
<b>I didn't make any mistakes, did I?</b>

723
00:41:49,707 --> 00:41:51,577
<b>No... No, you didn't.</b>

724
00:41:51,577 --> 00:41:53,646
<b>Really? I'm glad.</b>

725
00:41:54,447 --> 00:41:56,516
<b>Will you be working out today?</b>

726
00:41:57,146 --> 00:41:58,787
<b>Yes, I will.</b>

727
00:41:58,817 --> 00:42:01,187
<b>Then I'll see you
around the same time as yesterday.</b>

728
00:42:01,486 --> 00:42:02,516
<b>All right.</b>

729
00:42:12,866 --> 00:42:14,136
<b>You're so tiny...</b>

730
00:42:14,467 --> 00:42:15,537
<b>and cute.</b>

731
00:42:35,557 --> 00:42:36,787
<b>Why do I keep thinking about her?</b>

732
00:42:38,157 --> 00:42:40,957
<b>I must have had too many drinks.
Goodness.</b>

733
00:42:41,126 --> 00:42:43,256
<b>My entire body aches.</b>

734
00:42:43,866 --> 00:42:45,797
<b>I should ask her
to go easy on me today.</b>

735
00:42:46,496 --> 00:42:48,636
<b>I'm sorry for calling you
all of a sudden like this.</b>

736
00:42:49,236 --> 00:42:53,006
<b>No, it's all right. Actually,
I wanted to get some fresh air.</b>

737
00:42:54,537 --> 00:42:56,876
<b>But I hope everything is okay.</b>

738
00:42:57,846 --> 00:43:00,106
<b>I was just a bit worried.</b>

739
00:43:00,677 --> 00:43:03,376
<b>You recently went through
something traumatic.</b>

740
00:43:03,646 --> 00:43:06,447
<b>I was worried if it took
a psychological toll on you.</b>

741
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:08,856
<b>And I was wondering
if you needed my help.</b>

742
00:43:09,717 --> 00:43:11,427
<b>I'm okay now.</b>

743
00:43:11,427 --> 00:43:13,157
<b>It's all in the past.</b>

744
00:43:13,856 --> 00:43:15,026
<b>I'm glad to hear that.</b>

745
00:43:15,356 --> 00:43:18,467
<b>Right. If you need help later,
feel free to call me.</b>

746
00:43:19,126 --> 00:43:20,667
<b>Thank you, doctor.</b>

747
00:43:25,037 --> 00:43:29,006
<b>The other day,
we talked about your dream.</b>

748
00:43:29,006 --> 00:43:30,646
<b>You said you had a weird dream.</b>

749
00:43:30,846 --> 00:43:33,177
<b>Did you have a similar dream
like that ever since then?</b>

750
00:43:35,646 --> 00:43:38,287
<b>I did have similar dreams
after the first one.</b>

751
00:43:40,116 --> 00:43:42,157
<b>But I'm really fine these days.</b>

752
00:43:42,557 --> 00:43:45,327
<b>Thanks to Anchor Lee,
I'm really happy.</b>

753
00:43:45,657 --> 00:43:48,126
<b>- I see.
- If you aren't too busy,</b>

754
00:43:48,126 --> 00:43:49,197
<b>we should meet up together.</b>

755
00:43:49,197 --> 00:43:51,297
<b>We can get
something delicious and talk.</b>

756
00:43:51,827 --> 00:43:52,827
<b>Sure.</b>

757
00:44:05,876 --> 00:44:08,116
<b>(First Date, 7:40 a.m.)</b>

758
00:44:14,116 --> 00:44:15,787
<b>Who is it this early in the morning?</b>

759
00:44:17,226 --> 00:44:18,557
<b>It's for me!</b>

760
00:44:18,557 --> 00:44:20,856
<b>It's for me. Don't touch it!</b>

761
00:44:23,096 --> 00:44:26,167
<b>My goodness. What on earth is it?</b>

762
00:44:27,366 --> 00:44:28,837
<b>What did you buy this time?</b>

763
00:44:28,837 --> 00:44:30,167
<b>Some stuff.</b>

764
00:44:30,467 --> 00:44:33,236
<b>I thought you were going
on a date with Anchor Lee today.</b>

765
00:44:33,467 --> 00:44:35,106
<b>You said it was
your official first date.</b>

766
00:44:35,876 --> 00:44:37,146
<b>Yes, that's right.</b>

767
00:44:37,146 --> 00:44:38,776
<b>Can you help me move them?</b>

768
00:44:48,087 --> 00:44:49,516
<b>I decided on my wish.</b>

769
00:44:49,516 --> 00:44:52,386
<b>Today, you have to do
everything I ask you to do.</b>

770
00:44:54,927 --> 00:44:56,197
<b>She's making me anxious.</b>

771
00:44:58,827 --> 00:45:01,496
<b>I'm in front of your house.
Open the door for me.</b>

772
00:45:09,136 --> 00:45:10,677
<b>What's going on?</b>

773
00:45:10,677 --> 00:45:13,047
<b>We were supposed to meet
two hours later.</b>

774
00:45:13,047 --> 00:45:15,246
<b>I need water.
Could you give me a cup of water?</b>

775
00:45:15,246 --> 00:45:17,016
<b>Water? Okay.</b>

776
00:45:24,457 --> 00:45:25,457
<b>Here.</b>

777
00:45:27,457 --> 00:45:29,096
<b>What's all this?</b>

778
00:45:29,856 --> 00:45:31,327
<b>Open them now.</b>

779
00:45:38,266 --> 00:45:39,266
<b>Presents.</b>

780
00:45:39,467 --> 00:45:41,077
<b>They are all yours.</b>

781
00:45:43,606 --> 00:45:45,246
<b>What are...</b>

782
00:45:57,957 --> 00:45:59,827
<b>Don't you think
you'd look great in these?</b>

783
00:45:59,827 --> 00:46:01,557
<b>It's perfect on you. Right?</b>

784
00:46:02,026 --> 00:46:03,356
<b>I'm not sure.</b>

785
00:46:04,197 --> 00:46:05,327
<b>I don't know.</b>

786
00:46:05,327 --> 00:46:07,337
<b>That was made for you.</b>

787
00:46:07,337 --> 00:46:10,967
<b>Put that one. And what else
will look good with that?</b>

788
00:46:12,207 --> 00:46:13,667
<b>And try them with this.</b>

789
00:46:14,876 --> 00:46:16,207
<b>Put them on now?</b>

790
00:46:16,207 --> 00:46:18,606
<b>Yes, it's my wish.</b>

791
00:46:18,907 --> 00:46:22,077
<b>Wait. Have you been hating
my outfits all this time?</b>

792
00:46:22,077 --> 00:46:24,447
<b>You did talk about my tie
when you were on my show.</b>

793
00:46:24,447 --> 00:46:25,986
<b>Are you giving me
a wardrobe makeover?</b>

794
00:46:25,986 --> 00:46:27,616
<b>It's not that.</b>

795
00:46:27,817 --> 00:46:29,687
<b>It's our first date.</b>

796
00:46:29,856 --> 00:46:31,726
<b>There's this place
I really want to go,</b>

797
00:46:31,726 --> 00:46:33,896
<b>but I don't want people
to recognize us.</b>

798
00:46:33,896 --> 00:46:36,226
<b>If you go out dressed like that,
people will spot us in five minutes.</b>

799
00:46:36,226 --> 00:46:37,827
<b>It'll be so easy to recognize you.</b>

800
00:46:37,827 --> 00:46:39,766
<b>Think of this as a type of disguise.</b>

801
00:46:39,766 --> 00:46:41,937
<b>I don't think that will work on me.</b>

802
00:46:41,937 --> 00:46:43,067
<b>Trust me on this.</b>

803
00:46:43,067 --> 00:46:45,537
<b>People won't recognize you at all.
I assure you.</b>

804
00:46:45,537 --> 00:46:48,736
<b>Besides, you're supposed to do
whatever I ask of you today.</b>

805
00:46:51,006 --> 00:46:52,346
<b>Hurry and get changed.</b>

806
00:46:53,917 --> 00:46:55,646
<b>I did have a bad feeling about it.</b>

807
00:47:04,386 --> 00:47:06,126
<b>I really don't think
this is working.</b>

808
00:47:06,957 --> 00:47:08,327
<b>Let's try the next outfit.</b>

809
00:47:16,797 --> 00:47:18,506
<b>Is it supposed to look like this?</b>

810
00:47:26,547 --> 00:47:28,917
<b>What do you say? Do you like it?</b>

811
00:47:30,947 --> 00:47:31,947
<b>The last one.</b>

812
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:34,687
<b>- Another one?
- It's the last one.</b>

813
00:47:49,766 --> 00:47:51,006
<b>See?</b>

814
00:47:51,006 --> 00:47:53,707
<b>I bet you also think
this color stands out too much.</b>

815
00:47:53,707 --> 00:47:56,876
<b>No, I'm looking at you
because it looks great on you.</b>

816
00:47:57,106 --> 00:47:59,276
<b>From now on,
wear an outfit like this.</b>

817
00:47:59,276 --> 00:48:01,516
<b>It lightens up your looks
and makes you look more dashing.</b>

818
00:48:02,016 --> 00:48:04,217
<b>I really think you're teasing me.</b>

819
00:48:04,417 --> 00:48:06,016
<b>No, I'm not.</b>

820
00:48:06,117 --> 00:48:07,117
<b>By the way,</b>

821
00:48:07,786 --> 00:48:11,026
<b>what is this place
you wanted to go on a date?</b>

822
00:48:11,026 --> 00:48:14,226
<b>Oh, that.
You'll know once we get there.</b>

823
00:48:14,726 --> 00:48:17,296
<b>I daresay
you never thought of this place.</b>

824
00:48:17,967 --> 00:48:20,326
<b>All of a sudden, you're scaring me.</b>

825
00:48:20,897 --> 00:48:23,236
<b>Was going on dates supposed
to be full of thrill like this?</b>

826
00:48:23,236 --> 00:48:24,967
<b>I'm really excited.</b>

827
00:48:37,147 --> 00:48:39,687
<b>Is this the place
you wanted to come on a date?</b>

828
00:48:39,687 --> 00:48:40,687
<b>Yes.</b>

829
00:48:41,717 --> 00:48:43,586
<b>I don't see anything special here.</b>

830
00:48:44,026 --> 00:48:46,526
<b>Isn't the cherry blossom path
just so gorgeous?</b>

831
00:48:46,526 --> 00:48:47,826
<b>Whenever I passed by here in a car,</b>

832
00:48:47,826 --> 00:48:50,256
<b>I saw couples holding hands here.</b>

833
00:48:50,256 --> 00:48:52,066
<b>I was really jealous of them.</b>

834
00:48:55,397 --> 00:48:56,397
<b>What is it?</b>

835
00:48:57,137 --> 00:48:59,236
<b>Were you disappointed
because it's too plain?</b>

836
00:48:59,766 --> 00:49:00,836
<b>No.</b>

837
00:49:02,006 --> 00:49:03,576
<b>I would not have thought
of this place.</b>

838
00:49:04,006 --> 00:49:05,076
<b>I like it.</b>

839
00:49:06,847 --> 00:49:08,246
<b>Let's get off now.</b>

840
00:49:09,217 --> 00:49:10,947
<b>Right. Hold on.</b>

841
00:49:11,947 --> 00:49:13,316
<b>Just in case.</b>

842
00:49:20,026 --> 00:49:21,397
<b>There.</b>

843
00:49:23,056 --> 00:49:24,066
<b>Let's go.</b>

844
00:49:54,296 --> 00:49:55,857
<b>The weather is great today.</b>

845
00:49:55,857 --> 00:49:56,857
<b>Right?</b>

846
00:49:58,326 --> 00:49:59,796
<b>Hey, it's them.</b>

847
00:49:59,796 --> 00:50:02,467
<b>- My goodness.
- Gosh.</b>

848
00:50:03,566 --> 00:50:05,867
<b>Isn't that Yeo Ha Jin?
Isn't that Anchor Lee Jeong Hoon?</b>

849
00:50:05,867 --> 00:50:07,437
<b>I don't believe this. No way!</b>

850
00:50:08,036 --> 00:50:09,336
<b>My goodness!</b>

851
00:50:10,236 --> 00:50:12,177
<b>- You guys look great together!
- You look great together!</b>

852
00:50:12,806 --> 00:50:13,806
<b>Let's go.</b>

853
00:50:14,276 --> 00:50:16,316
<b>That was quicker than I expected.</b>

854
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:17,887
<b>Right.</b>

855
00:50:19,687 --> 00:50:22,857
<b>We should give up on this path.
Let's go back to the car.</b>

856
00:50:26,026 --> 00:50:27,927
<b>You said you really wanted
to walk this path.</b>

857
00:50:29,496 --> 00:50:31,427
<b>But people can recognize us.</b>

858
00:50:31,427 --> 00:50:32,766
<b>Let them, then.</b>

859
00:50:33,996 --> 00:50:35,667
<b>There's no reason why we must hide.</b>

860
00:50:42,177 --> 00:50:43,177
<b>Let's go.</b>

861
00:51:23,316 --> 00:51:25,117
<b>This is beautiful.</b>

862
00:51:25,717 --> 00:51:27,986
<b>This is how it feels
to see it up close.</b>

863
00:51:28,857 --> 00:51:30,717
<b>What do you say?
Isn't this worth it?</b>

864
00:51:31,556 --> 00:51:32,586
<b>It's nice.</b>

865
00:51:33,627 --> 00:51:35,996
<b>I only saw cherry blossoms
on the news every year.</b>

866
00:51:37,397 --> 00:51:39,697
<b>Let's come back and see
the cherry blossoms every spring.</b>

867
00:51:40,967 --> 00:51:41,967
<b>Yes.</b>

868
00:51:50,476 --> 00:51:51,877
<b>What are you thinking?</b>

869
00:51:53,207 --> 00:51:54,617
<b>That it's unfair.</b>

870
00:51:54,877 --> 00:51:56,377
<b>What's unfair?</b>

871
00:51:57,316 --> 00:51:58,647
<b>Come to think of it,</b>

872
00:51:59,246 --> 00:52:02,187
<b>I granted you
more than just one wish today.</b>

873
00:52:02,516 --> 00:52:04,486
<b>I had to try on
so many different outfits.</b>

874
00:52:05,586 --> 00:52:07,026
<b>Do you really think
it's that unfair?</b>

875
00:52:07,756 --> 00:52:09,857
<b>But sorry, it's too late.</b>

876
00:52:10,026 --> 00:52:11,427
<b>You can't take it back.</b>

877
00:52:11,996 --> 00:52:13,127
<b>Instead,</b>

878
00:52:14,127 --> 00:52:15,637
<b>grant me a wish too.</b>

879
00:52:17,167 --> 00:52:18,407
<b>That's so cheap.</b>

880
00:52:19,137 --> 00:52:20,637
<b>Fine, what is it?</b>

881
00:52:23,506 --> 00:52:25,306
<b>No matter what happens,</b>

882
00:52:26,677 --> 00:52:28,746
<b>don't ever say goodbye.</b>

883
00:52:31,447 --> 00:52:32,647
<b>That's my wish.</b>

884
00:52:37,627 --> 00:52:40,326
<b>I'll probably do it anyway
even if you didn't wish for that.</b>

885
00:52:43,296 --> 00:52:45,066
<b>Okay, then. I'll do that.</b>

886
00:52:50,296 --> 00:52:51,607
<b>You promised.</b>

887
00:52:53,566 --> 00:52:54,976
<b>Okay. I promise.</b>

888
00:53:52,467 --> 00:53:53,467
<b>Go inside.</b>

889
00:53:53,726 --> 00:53:56,167
<b>Okay. Call me when you get home.</b>

890
00:53:56,296 --> 00:53:58,836
<b>Okay. You should go in.</b>

891
00:54:02,177 --> 00:54:04,137
<b>Anchor Lee, give me your phone.</b>

892

<b>My phone?</b>

893
00:54:06,207 --> 00:54:08,377
<b>- Why do you want my phone?
- It'll take only a second.</b>

894
00:54:21,226 --> 00:54:23,857
<b>You can't change that
without my permission, okay?</b>

895
00:54:24,197 --> 00:54:27,026
<b>Okay. Go in and get some rest.</b>

896
00:54:27,967 --> 00:54:29,836
<b>Okay, I'm really going in.</b>

897
00:55:16,976 --> 00:55:18,117

919
00:56:41,266 --> 00:56:43,066
<b>Can we just talk on the phone?</b>

920
00:56:43,066 --> 00:56:45,066
<b>It's a bit awkward
to be on a video call.</b>

921
00:56:45,207 --> 00:56:48,576
<b>No. Then stay still.
I'll just find a way to look at you.</b>

922
00:56:51,707 --> 00:56:54,306
<b>Right, did you see how
I changed my name on your phone?</b>

923
00:56:54,947 --> 00:56:57,016
<b>You can't change that
without my permission.</b>

924
00:56:57,647 --> 00:57:00,546
<b>I'm the only one
who sees this phone anyway.</b>

925
00:57:00,617 --> 00:57:01,986
<b>Is it that important?</b>

926
00:57:01,986 --> 00:57:03,187
<b>Of course, it is.</b>

927
00:57:03,187 --> 00:57:05,826
<b>Of all people,
you'll be seeing my name like that.</b>

928
00:57:05,826 --> 00:57:07,756
<b>"Yeo Ha Jin"? That's so cold.</b>

929
00:57:07,756 --> 00:57:09,127
<b>You might end up
losing the love you had.</b>

930
00:57:09,397 --> 00:57:11,226
<b>How did you store my name?</b>

931
00:57:12,467 --> 00:57:13,597
<b>"Anchor Lee".</b>

932
00:57:14,536 --> 00:57:16,266
<b>It doesn't sound
that different from mine.</b>

933
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:17,637
<b>It's completely different.</b>

934
00:57:17,967 --> 00:57:20,036
<b>I put hearts surrounding your name,</b>

935
00:57:20,036 --> 00:57:21,276
<b>and two each.</b>

936
00:57:22,637 --> 00:57:24,437
<b>I like calling you Anchor Lee.</b>

937
00:57:25,246 --> 00:57:28,847
<b>In dramas, I've seen people called
as a general manager or a director,</b>

938
00:57:28,847 --> 00:57:30,847
<b>but never an anchor.</b>

939
00:57:31,486 --> 00:57:33,286
<b>Okay, do whatever you want.</b>

940
00:57:34,586 --> 00:57:35,657
<b>Get some rest, then.</b>

941
00:57:35,786 --> 00:57:36,957
<b>Are you hanging up already?</b>

942
00:57:37,816 --> 00:57:39,657
<b>Oh, it's not like that.</b>

943
00:57:39,657 --> 00:57:40,887
<b>Do you not want to talk to me?</b>

944
00:57:40,887 --> 00:57:43,957
<b>Yeo Ha Jin! Look at your room.</b>

945
00:57:44,097 --> 00:57:46,667
<b>It's like a pigsty.
Is this a pigsty?</b>

946
00:57:46,667 --> 00:57:49,397
<b>Ha Kyung, later. Do that later.</b>

947
00:57:49,397 --> 00:57:51,506
<b>- It's nothing.
- Look at your outfit.</b>

948
00:57:51,506 --> 00:57:53,506
<b>- I'll call you again.
- Anchor Lee, look at this.</b>

949
00:57:53,506 --> 00:57:54,707
<b>Look at this.</b>

950
00:57:54,937 --> 00:57:57,707
<b>Hey. I'll call you again. Sorry.</b>

951
00:57:57,836 --> 00:57:59,576
<b>Hello, viewers.</b>

952
00:57:59,576 --> 00:58:01,516
<b>This is "Yeo Ha Jin's Dirty Room".</b>

953
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:05,617
<b>Make sure you keep your promise.</b>

954
00:58:06,447 --> 00:58:07,546
<b>Goodnight.</b>

955
00:58:10,286 --> 00:58:11,486
<b>- Hey.
- What?</b>

956
00:58:11,486 --> 00:58:13,056
<b>You need to knock.
Show some manners.</b>

957
00:58:13,056 --> 00:58:15,597
<b>"Manners"? I was going out
to eat something delicious,</b>

958
00:58:15,597 --> 00:58:17,556
<b>so I thought I'd ask you to come,
but forget it.</b>

959
00:58:18,167 --> 00:58:19,766
<b>Where are you going?
I'll go with you.</b>

960
00:58:19,766 --> 00:58:21,667
<b>If you come out in 10 minutes
after cleaning up your room.</b>

961
00:58:21,697 --> 00:58:22,967
<b>I'll clean it up after we eat.</b>

962
00:58:22,967 --> 00:58:23,996
<b>No.</b>

963
00:58:25,336 --> 00:58:26,437
<b>You have 10 minutes!</b>

964
00:58:35,117 --> 00:58:36,417
<b>(Tae Eun)</b>

965
00:58:36,417 --> 00:58:39,286
<b>Can we meet for a second?
I have to talk to you.</b>

966
00:58:39,546 --> 00:58:40,847
<b>It's about Ha Jin.</b>

967
00:58:53,427 --> 00:58:54,427
<b>Wait.</b>

968
00:59:04,746 --> 00:59:06,207
<b>This is yours.</b>

969
00:59:06,746 --> 00:59:09,476
<b>These are mine. Don't touch mine.</b>

970
00:59:09,776 --> 00:59:13,117
<b>Only if it wasn't past 10 p.m.,
I'd have a bite of each one.</b>

971
00:59:15,016 --> 00:59:16,387
<b>That looks good.</b>

972
00:59:16,417 --> 00:59:17,417
<b>This is good.</b>

973
00:59:18,157 --> 00:59:19,226
<b>I'm so jealous.</b>

974
00:59:20,457 --> 00:59:24,127
<b>I'm hungry.
I'm hungry. I'm so hungry.</b>

975
00:59:25,266 --> 00:59:26,397
<b>I'm hungry.</b>

976
00:59:26,566 --> 00:59:28,336
<b>- You can have a bite.
- Okay.</b>

977
00:59:28,336 --> 00:59:31,236
<b>Hey, wait!
That's not a bite. Hands off.</b>

978
00:59:31,236 --> 00:59:33,536
<b>- You can't take it back.
- This is too big of a bite.</b>

979
00:59:33,536 --> 00:59:35,607
<b>- My bite is that big.
- Hey. Hey.</b>

980
00:59:35,607 --> 00:59:38,147
<b>Hey, wait.
I'm not doing this for myself.</b>

981
00:59:38,147 --> 00:59:40,347
<b>Wait, think about this
one more time.</b>

982
00:59:40,847 --> 00:59:43,746
<b>Wait. That's coffee. Wait.</b>

983
00:59:43,917 --> 00:59:46,516
<b>Wait here. I'll bring the coffee.
Don't eat this.</b>

984
00:59:46,786 --> 00:59:47,986
<b>I have my eyes on you.</b>

985
00:59:47,986 --> 00:59:50,316
<b>- I'll keep watching you as I go.
- Trust me.</b>

986
00:59:52,187 --> 00:59:54,586
<b>- Don't eat that.
- I won't.</b>

987
01:00:05,967 --> 01:00:07,937
<b>- Ha Na. Over here.
- Yes?</b>

988
01:00:08,976 --> 01:00:11,347
<b>Ha Na, you look so pretty.</b>

989
01:00:11,907 --> 01:00:13,847
<b>- Don't say that.
- My gosh.</b>

990
01:00:13,877 --> 01:00:16,347
<b>No way, you look much prettier now.</b>

991
01:00:48,046 --> 01:00:50,847
<b>Ha Jin. Ha Jin, what's wrong?
Are you feeling sick?</b>

992
01:00:51,177 --> 01:00:53,447
<b>Do you have a headache?
How does it hurt?</b>

993
01:00:54,647 --> 01:00:57,117
<b>This isn't good.
Let's go to the hospital.</b>

994
01:01:00,857 --> 01:01:02,726
<b>What is it? Why did you
want to see me this late?</b>

995
01:01:02,996 --> 01:01:04,157
<b>You're here.</b>

996
01:01:05,167 --> 01:01:06,367
<b>What is it?</b>

997
01:01:07,296 --> 01:01:09,066
<b>There's something
I couldn't tell you.</b>

998
01:01:11,937 --> 01:01:13,236
<b>Ha Kyung.</b>

999
01:01:15,276 --> 01:01:16,736
<b>Do you know who Yeong is?</b>

1000
01:01:21,046 --> 01:01:22,046
<b>What?</b>

1001
01:01:23,016 --> 01:01:24,546
<b>You know that name, don't you?</b>

1002
01:01:27,016 --> 01:01:28,387
<b>Who's Yeong?</b>

1003
01:01:31,387 --> 01:01:33,056
<b>I'm sure you know.</b>

1004
01:01:34,026 --> 01:01:35,826
<b>Tell me now. Please?</b>

1005
01:01:38,627 --> 01:01:41,437
<b>The reason why
Ha Jin was so tormented...</b>

1006
01:01:43,897 --> 01:01:45,367
<b>that she wanted to
take her own life.</b>

1007
01:01:47,806 --> 01:01:49,137
<b>Yeong...</b>

1008
01:01:54,107 --> 01:01:56,917
<b>Yeong died because of me.</b>

1009
01:02:00,187 --> 01:02:02,117
<b>She died because of me.</b>

1010
01:02:38,687 --> 01:02:40,927
<b>(Find Me in Your Memory)</b>

1011
01:02:41,256 --> 01:02:43,627
<b>I want Ha Na to be happy again.</b>

1012
01:02:43,627 --> 01:02:45,496
<b>I want to tell Ha Jin that...</b>

1013
01:02:45,496 --> 01:02:46,667
<b>it was an accident.</b>

1014
01:02:46,667 --> 01:02:48,867
<b>She was murdered by her stalker.</b>

1015
01:02:48,867 --> 01:02:50,467
<b>Her name is Seo Yeon?</b>

1016
01:02:50,467 --> 01:02:53,137
<b>He's a guy who has
another person in his heart.</b>

1017
01:02:53,137 --> 01:02:54,467
<b>Can you really take him?</b>

1018
01:02:54,467 --> 01:02:58,347
<b>The time I spend with you is
very special.</b>

1019
01:02:58,347 --> 01:03:00,046
<b>I hope that's the case with you too.</b>

1020
01:03:00,046 --> 01:03:01,717
<b>Is something going on
with Anchor Lee?</b>

1021
01:03:01,717 --> 01:03:05,016
<b>Do you want to
talk about Anchor Lee Jeong Hoon?</b>

1022
01:03:05,016 --> 01:03:08,516
<b>So you want to hear the truth?</b>

1023
01:03:08,516 --> 01:03:11,586
<b>I made Ha Na unhappy.</b>
