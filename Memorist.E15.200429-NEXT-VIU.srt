1
00:00:13,096 --> 00:00:20,836
(All characters, organizations, places, and events are fictional.)

2
00:00:25,906 --> 00:00:28,616
(2 years ago)

3
00:00:35,415 --> 00:00:36,716
How is Dong Baek doing?

4
00:00:37,156 --> 00:00:38,326
Is he adjusting well?

5
00:00:38,326 --> 00:00:40,756
Yes, he's been quiet lately.

6
00:00:40,756 --> 00:00:43,025
It hasn't been that long since he got kicked out of Metro.

7
00:00:44,065 --> 00:00:46,226
Is that so?

8
00:00:48,135 --> 00:00:49,266
Then how about from now on?

9
00:00:50,135 --> 00:00:52,705
- Pardon? - How do you think he'll behave?

10
00:00:53,006 --> 00:00:55,976
Well, he's known to be very unusual.

11
00:00:55,976 --> 00:00:58,375
- And he does whatever he wants... - He's hard to control, right?

12
00:01:00,105 --> 00:01:02,875
But he's kind at heart, so with a little bit of help...

13
00:01:02,875 --> 00:01:03,985
And what?

14
00:01:08,555 --> 00:01:10,355
The support of the police...

15
00:01:10,355 --> 00:01:11,786
will act as a stepping stone...

16
00:01:11,786 --> 00:01:13,525
to help him succeed even more.

17
00:01:26,036 --> 00:01:27,736
- Captain Koo. - Yes, sir?

18
00:01:28,676 --> 00:01:29,836
How about this?

19
00:01:31,976 --> 00:01:34,616
Let's not become someone who supports him.

20
00:01:35,146 --> 00:01:36,515
Let's be the person who receives his help.

21
00:01:37,385 --> 00:01:38,946
- Okay? - But sir...

22
00:01:38,946 --> 00:01:40,586
That will be good...

23
00:01:40,586 --> 00:01:42,316
for both the police force and Dong Baek himself.

25
00:01:43,086 --> 00:01:44,786
Do you understand?

26
00:01:45,756 --> 00:01:47,825
Yes, I understand what you mean.

27
00:01:47,825 --> 00:01:49,295
If that's the case,

28
00:01:52,165 --> 00:01:54,536
make him write a resignation letter.

29
00:01:58,336 --> 00:02:00,366
Let's have him get dismissed...

30
00:02:00,706 --> 00:02:03,536
and only use him when we need his power.

31
00:02:04,146 --> 00:02:05,805
He can help solve violent crimes...

32
00:02:05,805 --> 00:02:07,816
Detective Dong won't accept that.

33
00:02:09,376 --> 00:02:13,045
From what I heard, he's always been very fond of you.

34
00:02:14,556 --> 00:02:17,485
I'm also not sure if that's the right thing...

35
00:02:17,485 --> 00:02:18,485
Captain Koo.

36
00:02:22,026 --> 00:02:24,665
There's no right or wrong when it comes to the organization.

37
00:02:25,865 --> 00:02:27,496
It's just a matter of making a choice.

38
00:02:33,406 --> 00:02:34,406
Let's drink.

39
00:02:44,786 --> 00:02:47,615
Gosh, come on. This isn't fair.

40
00:02:47,615 --> 00:02:50,056
Old Man, I brought some guests.

41
00:02:50,216 --> 00:02:52,925
- My gosh. - Shut it.

42
00:02:59,566 --> 00:03:00,566
Gosh, that stings.

43
00:03:03,436 --> 00:03:05,265
Is it fun to play detective?

44
00:03:05,806 --> 00:03:07,876
I'm having a blast.

45
00:03:07,906 --> 00:03:10,976
Do you know that people with power are scared because of you?

46
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:13,346
Why? Is someone scared about getting caught?

47
00:03:13,346 --> 00:03:16,216
Those guys lived comfortably all their lives.

48
00:03:16,216 --> 00:03:17,946
But they might lose everything because of you.

49
00:03:17,946 --> 00:03:19,316
So of course, they're nervous.

50
00:03:19,415 --> 00:03:22,056
Are you telling me to quit my job so the bad guys...

51
00:03:22,056 --> 00:03:23,915
- can live in peace? - No, it's not that.

52
00:03:23,915 --> 00:03:26,256
There are lots of other fun things to do.

53
00:03:26,385 --> 00:03:27,526
If you become a celebrity,

54
00:03:27,526 --> 00:03:29,496
you can get all the attention you want.

55
00:03:29,496 --> 00:03:31,226
You can't kick me out.

56
00:03:31,226 --> 00:03:33,226
I'm not trying to kick you out.

57
00:03:33,226 --> 00:03:36,865
I'm not going to quit until you retire.

58
00:03:37,806 --> 00:03:39,635
Because of you,

59
00:03:39,635 --> 00:03:42,276
I even gave up trying to fix my hair loss.

60
00:03:42,276 --> 00:03:44,906
I might die early because of stress.

61
00:03:46,276 --> 00:03:48,276
That hurts. Can you take this off for me?

62
00:03:48,276 --> 00:03:49,276
Come here.

63
00:03:54,186 --> 00:03:56,216
Why are you trying to caress me?

64
00:03:57,286 --> 00:03:59,085
Caress, my foot.

65
00:03:59,325 --> 00:04:00,526
Do it gently. It hurts.

66
00:04:00,526 --> 00:04:01,526
Gosh, it's cold.

67
00:04:06,325 --> 00:04:09,135
Don't try to fight against those who hate you...

68
00:04:09,735 --> 00:04:11,235
and just find what makes you happy.

69
00:04:11,906 --> 00:04:13,235
You can hate me if you want.

70
00:04:37,426 --> 00:04:38,426
No.

71
00:04:42,236 --> 00:04:43,236
Detective Dong.

72
00:04:44,506 --> 00:04:45,506
Catch them!

73
00:04:47,835 --> 00:04:48,835
Sir!

74
00:04:49,106 --> 00:04:50,975
- Sir! - Darn it.

75
00:04:51,046 --> 00:04:53,205
- No... - Run.

76
00:04:54,145 --> 00:04:55,145
Sir!

77
00:04:55,575 --> 00:04:56,575
- Sir! - Oh, gosh.

78
00:04:56,575 --> 00:04:58,345
- Sir, are you okay? - Wake up.

79
00:05:00,085 --> 00:05:01,916
What are you doing? Call 911!

80
00:05:02,756 --> 00:05:05,426
- Are you okay? - Please hurry up!

81
00:05:05,626 --> 00:05:08,556
- Is this 911? - I'm okay.

82
00:05:08,556 --> 00:05:10,095
- It doesn't hurt at all. - Someone got hurt.

83
00:05:10,095 --> 00:05:11,166
Please hurry.

84
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:14,566
His condition? Just get here as fast as you can.

85
00:05:15,535 --> 00:05:17,095
Sir!

86
00:05:26,475 --> 00:05:32,515
(Operating Room)

87
00:05:36,885 --> 00:05:40,486
(Restricted Area, Operating Room)

88
00:05:55,405 --> 00:05:57,176
(Officer Oh Se Hoon)

89
00:05:57,176 --> 00:06:00,145
The receiver cannot be reached. You will be directed to voicemail.

90
00:06:00,145 --> 00:06:01,145
You will be charged after...

91
00:06:41,515 --> 00:06:43,556
(The innocent shall be crucified in place of the sinner.)

92
00:06:50,426 --> 00:06:51,566
(Restricted Area, Operating Room)

93
00:06:51,566 --> 00:06:52,866
He'll be okay.

94
00:06:52,866 --> 00:06:54,436
Dad!

95
00:07:03,835 --> 00:07:06,645
Mom, what are we going to do?

96
00:07:16,486 --> 00:07:18,756
Where is Uncle Baek?

97
00:07:21,626 --> 00:07:22,626
He'll be here.

98
00:07:23,426 --> 00:07:24,996
But right now, he's busy.

99
00:07:28,196 --> 00:07:30,566
What are we going to do?

100
00:07:41,316 --> 00:07:42,316
Se Hoon.

101
00:07:46,616 --> 00:07:48,316
We got paged, so we need to go.

102
00:07:48,316 --> 00:07:49,316
Okay.

103
00:07:49,655 --> 00:07:51,285
Call me once the surgery ends.

104
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:07,066
The doctor doesn't know yet.

105
00:08:09,676 --> 00:08:11,306
We'll need to wait and see.

106
00:08:14,546 --> 00:08:17,946
We're all cops here. Show some respect.

107
00:08:19,515 --> 00:08:21,215
Is this really necessary?

108
00:08:21,215 --> 00:08:22,686
His life is at risk.

109
00:08:22,686 --> 00:08:23,686
That's enough.

110
00:08:45,075 --> 00:08:46,875
Gosh, that darn old man.

111
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:49,245
He's so slow. I can't believe he couldn't dodge that.

112
00:08:49,245 --> 00:08:51,886
It's like he's trying to make me feel guilty.

113
00:08:52,745 --> 00:08:54,955
This is all because of Dong Baek.

114
00:08:54,955 --> 00:08:58,056
It's not because of him. I'm the one who volunteered.

115
00:08:58,056 --> 00:08:59,556
Why would you volunteer?

116
00:08:59,556 --> 00:09:01,156
You're about to retire soon.

117
00:09:01,156 --> 00:09:03,825
Do you expect me to sit back and watch a kid fight by himself?

118
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:06,696
He's not a normal kid.

119
00:09:06,926 --> 00:09:08,436
Yes, he's not normal.

120
00:09:08,436 --> 00:09:10,595
He's a real pain in the neck.

121
00:09:10,595 --> 00:09:12,335
- My gosh. - But you see,

122
00:09:12,335 --> 00:09:14,166
he's no different from our kids.

123
00:09:15,105 --> 00:09:16,406
He laughs when he's in a good mood,

124
00:09:16,406 --> 00:09:17,875
and he cries when he's sad.

125
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:19,505
Then he shouts when he gets angry.

126
00:09:19,975 --> 00:09:23,115
He may be different, but that's only a small part.

127
00:09:23,115 --> 00:09:25,715
He's a normal human being just like us.

128
00:09:26,485 --> 00:09:28,556
Plus, he can't do anything without me.

129
00:09:28,556 --> 00:09:30,386
My goodness, you're unbelievable.

130
00:09:30,386 --> 00:09:31,686
I'm serious.

131
00:09:31,686 --> 00:09:33,026
- My gosh. - Baek.

132
00:09:33,526 --> 00:09:34,755
What? Why?

133
00:09:35,056 --> 00:09:36,796
Come on. Let's go inside.

134
00:09:37,355 --> 00:09:39,526
- Sir. - Hey, it's Dong Baek.

135
00:09:39,526 --> 00:09:42,436
We came to watch your interview.

136
00:09:42,436 --> 00:09:43,666
Gosh, we don't need to watch that.

137
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:44,835
There it is.

138
00:09:44,835 --> 00:09:48,505
What kind of person is Detective Dong?

139
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:51,075
He's an amazing young man.

140
00:09:51,646 --> 00:09:53,406
Oh, I see.

141
00:09:53,406 --> 00:09:56,176
How exactly is he amazing?

142
00:09:56,176 --> 00:10:01,686
Well, you can say that we're like father and son.

143
00:10:01,686 --> 00:10:05,255
We care for each other like any other family...

144
00:10:05,526 --> 00:10:08,825
The medicine I took is making me drowsy.

145
00:10:09,355 --> 00:10:10,526
Goodness.

146
00:10:11,896 --> 00:10:14,296
Father. Father?

147
00:10:14,835 --> 00:10:16,796
What was up with that interview?

148
00:10:17,536 --> 00:10:20,705
- Father, get up and talk to me. - Just let me rest.

149
00:10:20,806 --> 00:10:21,906
Dad?

150
00:10:23,235 --> 00:10:24,705
Give me back the remote control.

151
00:10:24,705 --> 00:10:26,306
Dad, come on.

152
00:10:38,386 --> 00:10:42,156
(Memorist: Ep 15, Flesh and Blood)

153
00:10:42,656 --> 00:10:44,495
- Dad! - Honey!

154
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:47,426
- Honey, open your eyes. - Dad...

155
00:10:47,566 --> 00:10:50,036
Honey, please open your eyes.

156
00:10:50,136 --> 00:10:52,666
- Coming through. - Wake up, will you?

157
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:55,176
Open your eyes.

158
00:10:55,276 --> 00:10:57,075
Honey!

159
00:10:57,335 --> 00:10:59,205
He passed out the moment he got here.

160
00:10:59,975 --> 00:11:02,176
Isn't Detective Dong overexerting himself?

161
00:11:11,556 --> 00:11:12,755
He's awake.

162
00:11:14,796 --> 00:11:17,156
Sure, I'll get back to you.

163
00:11:21,266 --> 00:11:22,536
Are you all right?

164
00:11:22,536 --> 00:11:24,266
You should rest a little more.

165
00:11:24,605 --> 00:11:26,735
What about the old man?

166
00:11:27,705 --> 00:11:29,605
The surgery went well but...

167
00:11:30,776 --> 00:11:32,176
I can take it, so tell me.

168
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:34,615
He hasn't gained consciousness.

169
00:11:36,115 --> 00:11:37,715
I'm sure he'll soon wake up though.

170
00:11:45,056 --> 00:11:46,786
You can't. The hospital is crawling with prosecutors...

171
00:11:46,786 --> 00:11:48,495
and officers from the Intelligence bureau.

172
00:11:48,825 --> 00:11:49,955
And Ms. Eun Soo Kyung?

173
00:11:50,095 --> 00:11:52,725
They're looking for her. I just talked to Superintendent Han.

174
00:11:54,566 --> 00:11:55,666
Detective.

175
00:11:55,995 --> 00:11:58,335
Don't worry. I'm not going anywhere.

176
00:12:00,705 --> 00:12:03,575
I'll be in the next room.

177
00:12:04,036 --> 00:12:05,176
Give me some time alone.

178
00:12:05,906 --> 00:12:07,276
Let me go there instead then.

179
00:12:07,605 --> 00:12:10,416
No, you should get some rest.

180
00:12:11,146 --> 00:12:12,745
It might be your last for a while.

181
00:12:25,896 --> 00:12:27,026
Thank you.

182
00:12:50,455 --> 00:12:51,625
Prosecutor Woo Seok Do?

183
00:12:53,955 --> 00:12:56,355
I was hoping to introduce myself in a formal setting,

184
00:12:56,755 --> 00:12:58,026
but I guess things are too urgent for that.

185
00:12:58,896 --> 00:13:01,365
Could we perhaps have a few words?

186
00:13:03,266 --> 00:13:04,396
Go ahead.

187
00:13:08,505 --> 00:13:10,176
I know you have grave interest in Detective Dong,

188
00:13:11,806 --> 00:13:14,345
but I'd appreciate you turning it down a notch.

189
00:13:14,575 --> 00:13:16,816
The prosecution being interested in a criminal...

190
00:13:17,345 --> 00:13:18,886
isn't the NIS's concern.

191
00:13:18,886 --> 00:13:20,686
Detective Dong isn't a criminal.

192
00:13:21,386 --> 00:13:22,516
We'll see about that.

193
00:13:23,686 --> 00:13:25,156
I also know of a criminal.

194
00:13:26,056 --> 00:13:28,625
There's this guy who got a victim killed...

195
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:30,196
by trying to cover up a chief prosecutor's scandal.

196
00:13:33,325 --> 00:13:35,636
I'm just saying since you're interested in criminals.

197
00:13:53,386 --> 00:13:55,316
It's a pleasure to meet you, Deputy Chief Lee.

198
00:13:55,686 --> 00:13:57,656
I'm Chief Kim of the NIS.

199
00:13:57,955 --> 00:13:59,686
Ms. Son, what brings you by?

200
00:14:01,156 --> 00:14:02,625
I didn't take you for a coward,

201
00:14:02,896 --> 00:14:04,095
but here you are lying about your identity.

202
00:14:04,526 --> 00:14:05,766
Is this about Dong Baek?

203
00:14:07,526 --> 00:14:09,166
I knew you'd figure it out.

204
00:14:09,965 --> 00:14:12,536
I'm afraid there's nothing I can help you with though.

205
00:14:14,066 --> 00:14:15,176
Shall we?

206
00:14:17,475 --> 00:14:19,306
This won't go your way.

207
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:23,046
It won't.

208
00:14:23,989 --> 00:14:26,119
(Chairwoman Hwang Pil Seon)

209
00:14:36,029 --> 00:14:38,200
I'm Prosecutor Woo Seok Do of the Central Prosecutors' Office.

210
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:55,289
I was told by the prosecutor general to help you in any way I can.

211
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:06,029
The culprit has been identified, so he'll be put down soon.

212
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:09,430
- And the brat? - The same goes for Dong Baek.

213
00:15:09,899 --> 00:15:13,399
But first, there's something we need to sort out.

214
00:15:13,869 --> 00:15:16,210
It requires a promise from the prosecutors' office.

215
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:19,080
- A promise? - A non-indictment.

216
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:25,080
Dong Baek's death will turn the world upside down.

217
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:27,050
The press will have a field day...

218
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:29,690
and the prosecution will use this chance...

219
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,820
to point its swords.

220
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,460
So you need me to guarantee...

221
00:15:35,029 --> 00:15:36,389
a non-indictment?

222
00:15:39,129 --> 00:15:42,029
This isn't something I can decide on my own.

223
00:15:42,169 --> 00:15:44,570
I already cleared it with your boss.

224
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,269
Then why do you need my word too?

225
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:49,909
Incompetent.

226
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,539
- Sorry? - Your boss is incompetent.

227
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:57,950
He shouldn't have let this get so far, but look at this mess.

228
00:15:58,149 --> 00:16:00,749
It's like we're criminals discussing our next crime.

229
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:03,919
- I apologize, ma'am. - Save it.

230
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:07,959
So what'll it be?

231
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:12,860
Do you really want the prosecution to spend its resources...

232
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,459
cleaning up after others?

233
00:16:20,469 --> 00:16:22,369
No, ma'am. That ends right here.

234
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,110
I'll handle the situation myself...

235
00:16:24,409 --> 00:16:27,639
so that you never have to be concerned anymore.

236
00:16:31,149 --> 00:16:32,419
That's the spirit.

237
00:16:33,479 --> 00:16:34,820
I hope you'll keep it that way.

238
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:39,689
You remind me of...

239
00:16:40,659 --> 00:16:43,560
how your boss was six years ago.

240
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:48,729
Once you lose your drive,

241
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,500
your power and authority disappear with it.

242
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,250
Former Assemblyman Bang Joon Seok, who was assaulted by Detective Dong,

243
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:05,979
went back to helping the police...

244
00:17:05,979 --> 00:17:09,350
find his wife despite recommendations from his doctors.

245
00:17:09,449 --> 00:17:11,820
If Detective Dong truly is an accomplice,

246
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,320
then I plead to him.

247
00:17:14,619 --> 00:17:16,360
Please let my wife go.

248
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:18,090
The police have declared Detective Dong's assault...

249
00:17:18,090 --> 00:17:19,760
as an act of terror...

250
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,369
and announced that they'd arrest him immediately.

251
00:17:22,369 --> 00:17:26,399
Detective Dong's assault on Mr. Bang added to the suspicion...

252
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:30,540
of him being the Eraser's accomplice.

253
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:33,310
The serial killer known as the Eraser...

254
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:35,610
made a threat against Detective Dong,

255
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:39,020
but many suspect that it was a trick...

256
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:41,149
to mask the relationship between them.

257
00:17:41,149 --> 00:17:42,990
Fear is now increasing among the public...

258
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,020
Let me attend to your bruise.

259
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:10,479
What's your relationship with him?

260
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:13,850
Sorry?

261
00:18:15,189 --> 00:18:16,520
You and Moon Yong Gang.

262
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:21,959
I don't think I follow, sir.

263
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,899
Did you think I wouldn't know?

264
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:29,969
- There's nothing going on. - Then why...

265
00:18:30,669 --> 00:18:31,939
did you visit him at the hospital?

266
00:18:34,969 --> 00:18:36,110
Well...

267
00:18:38,709 --> 00:18:39,840
Have you been scheming with him?

268
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:43,209
Did he offer you money...

269
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,080
for helping to kill me?

270
00:18:48,719 --> 00:18:49,850
Look at me.

271
00:18:53,219 --> 00:18:54,419
Look at me, darn it.

272
00:18:57,330 --> 00:18:58,600
If you're not working together,

273
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,100
are you two intimate?

274
00:19:03,229 --> 00:19:04,399
We are not.

275
00:19:04,869 --> 00:19:06,840
There's really nothing between us.

276
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,050
I knew from the get-go.

277
00:19:16,979 --> 00:19:18,649
At first, you looked like...

278
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:22,219
you wanted something from me.

279
00:19:25,719 --> 00:19:29,429
Gosh. But you got together with a lowlife like him.

280
00:19:31,959 --> 00:19:33,760
You're so cheap.

281
00:19:37,399 --> 00:19:38,899
I'll go now.

282
00:19:41,939 --> 00:19:43,409
What a shame.

283
00:19:44,139 --> 00:19:46,139
I would've put you in the pool...

284
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:49,879
of potential second wives once my wife died.

285
00:20:03,959 --> 00:20:05,100
Keep an eye on her.

286
00:20:06,459 --> 00:20:07,459
Yes, sir.

287
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,500
What are you doing?

288
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:50,869
I was just...

289
00:20:50,869 --> 00:20:51,879
Just what?

290
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:54,780
Just... Well... Thinking?

291
00:20:56,479 --> 00:20:57,649
Should I take a guess?

292
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:09,189
What are you doing?

293
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:12,060
You were thinking about me.

294
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,360
Am I wrong?

295
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,100
Yes.

296
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:17,570
Darn it.

297
00:21:20,869 --> 00:21:21,869
I'm jealous.

298
00:21:22,639 --> 00:21:25,879
I wish I could read people's memories like you.

299
00:21:27,379 --> 00:21:28,510
It's not good at all.

300
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,550
Why not? I think it would be awesome.

301
00:21:32,879 --> 00:21:33,879
It isn't.

302
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:37,320
People's memories...

303
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:40,090
aren't as nice as you think.

304
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:44,229
There are so many things I wish I never knew.

305
00:21:49,869 --> 00:21:52,070
I'm sure there are some that you're happy about knowing.

306
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:56,540
I'm not sure. Were there any?

307
00:21:58,580 --> 00:21:59,580
Here.

308
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,649
Take it out if you need.

309
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,379
All of my memories.

310
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:06,449
I've been...

311
00:22:06,979 --> 00:22:09,189
thinking especially more about you recently.

312
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:13,590
Made you smile.

313
00:22:15,159 --> 00:22:19,229
See? Your ability made at least two people happy.

314
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:25,540
Baek.

315
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,939
Your ability...

316
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:31,939
may be able to make a great number of people happy.

317
00:22:33,979 --> 00:22:35,209
Then eventually...

318
00:22:36,379 --> 00:22:38,679
the world may change and become a better place.

319
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:41,679
Can it...

320
00:22:43,889 --> 00:22:47,419
Can it really change?

321
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,209
I'd like to make a statement.

322
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,949
Please don't kill me.

323
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,090
Please?

324
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:19,159
I've already...

325
00:23:19,719 --> 00:23:22,860
saved many people.

326
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,699
I know you're a good person.

327
00:23:26,929 --> 00:23:28,699
So please...

328
00:23:29,129 --> 00:23:30,570
There's no rule...

329
00:23:31,129 --> 00:23:33,669
that says a good person can't become bad.

330
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:38,209
Rather, I've been too good a person.

331
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:41,110
So the pain that I've suffered...

332
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:45,010
feels even more unfair.

333
00:23:46,449 --> 00:23:47,649
Things like that...

334
00:23:48,419 --> 00:23:50,250
shouldn't happen...

335
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:55,090
to me...

336
00:23:56,659 --> 00:23:58,290
and to my baby.

337
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:02,169
Don't you agree?

338
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,669
20 years ago,

339
00:24:08,669 --> 00:24:11,740
I went abroad to rescue people after an earthquake.

340
00:24:11,979 --> 00:24:13,780
I suddenly had to rush home.

341
00:24:14,479 --> 00:24:17,979
They said my daughter had died.

342
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:26,159
But it wasn't a natural death.

343
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:29,830
I had seen many deaths...

344
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:32,030
during my years as a firefighter.

345
00:24:32,629 --> 00:24:36,270
Even when my wife died,

346
00:24:37,469 --> 00:24:39,939
I wasn't as afraid as I was that day.

347
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,310
They said...

348
00:24:45,139 --> 00:24:47,209
she had committed suicide.

349
00:24:48,709 --> 00:24:49,780
However,

350
00:24:50,879 --> 00:24:52,280
that wasn't true.

351
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:57,149
I wish...

352
00:24:58,550 --> 00:25:01,290
I never found out.

353
00:25:05,399 --> 00:25:06,459
Yoo Ah Young?

354
00:25:10,969 --> 00:25:11,969
So Philip?

355
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:15,439
Darn it. What are you doing here?

356
00:25:15,439 --> 00:25:17,570
I'm taking pictures.

357
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:19,639
What about you?

358
00:25:19,639 --> 00:25:21,979
My friend owns this land.

359
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:24,149
All of this...

360
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,449
is his.

361
00:25:28,379 --> 00:25:29,619
Bang Joon Seok.

362
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,520
Don't you know him?

363
00:25:32,419 --> 00:25:35,490
That's right. We go to different schools now.

364
00:25:36,389 --> 00:25:38,929
Darn it. What's wrong with me?

365
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:40,530
Were you...

366
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,100
drinking?

367
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,469
Something much better.

368
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:54,540
See you later.

369
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:04,449
Darn it.

370
00:26:04,689 --> 00:26:07,889
You should pay an access fee for entering someone else's land.

371
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:11,830
What?

372
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:14,060
Want a drink?

373
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,800
It'll take you to paradise.

374
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:38,020
Those jerks trampled on Ah Young.

375
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:42,189
But that wasn't where their sins ended.

376
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,860
Hey. Look at this.

377
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:47,600
Here are some more.

378
00:26:48,429 --> 00:26:49,830
Come on.

379
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:50,899
What is it?

380
00:26:51,629 --> 00:26:54,500
Come on, don't do it.

381
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,270
I asked, what is it?

382
00:27:06,479 --> 00:27:07,550
Moon Yong Dae?

383
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:09,419
Darn it.

384
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:17,030
Where's Ah Young?

385
00:27:29,469 --> 00:27:31,340
Why you...

386
00:27:34,379 --> 00:27:36,979
Get him!

387
00:28:05,209 --> 00:28:08,209
I can't stand your eyes. They annoy me.

388
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:20,159
He burned Yong Dae.

389
00:28:20,659 --> 00:28:23,689
And while he was still alive,

390
00:28:24,229 --> 00:28:27,199
he threw him off a cliff.

391
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:30,199
That day,

392
00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:34,070
two children were killed...

393
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:37,639
by your husband, Bang Joon Seok!

394
00:28:39,810 --> 00:28:44,610
My child's friend died that very day,

395
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:48,449
but my child...

396
00:29:13,639 --> 00:29:14,740
Hey.

397
00:29:17,909 --> 00:29:19,850
Detective Lee, what brings you here?

398
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:28,419
You really need to come to your senses...

399
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:31,689
if you don't want to rot in prison.

400
00:29:39,169 --> 00:29:41,040
My daughter lived.

401
00:29:41,669 --> 00:29:43,409
Both her body and mind...

402
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:46,139
were completely destroyed.

403
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:49,310
But she didn't die.

404
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:54,280
(Gynecologist, Jeong Hyeong Sik)

405
00:29:58,350 --> 00:30:00,659
I don't see any signs of resistance.

406
00:30:09,669 --> 00:30:12,439
Ah Young, I believe you.

407
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:16,439
But some people could take this the wrong way.

408
00:30:16,869 --> 00:30:18,979
Imagine how sad your dad will be if he finds out.

409
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:20,740
Don't you agree?

410
00:30:21,879 --> 00:30:24,850
You know Moon Yong Dae, right?

411
00:30:26,979 --> 00:30:29,219
I'm not supposed to tell you this.

412
00:30:32,619 --> 00:30:33,689
But he died.

413
00:30:37,659 --> 00:30:38,760
He committed suicide.

414
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:43,669
Remember that place where you had fun with those guys?

415
00:30:44,469 --> 00:30:45,699
He died nearby.

416
00:30:49,369 --> 00:30:51,540
I wonder if he saw something there.

417
00:31:22,639 --> 00:31:24,740
She survived that day.

418
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:27,840
But she died inside...

419
00:31:28,179 --> 00:31:29,649
every single day.

420
00:31:34,379 --> 00:31:36,149
I also have a child.

421
00:31:37,619 --> 00:31:40,919
If you let me live, I'll do anything you ask.

422
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:43,659
But you see,

423
00:31:45,189 --> 00:31:47,199
after having gone through something like that,

424
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:50,399
I finally realized something.

425
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,899
I realized that there's no reason...

426
00:31:57,209 --> 00:31:58,939
behind our misfortunes.

427
00:32:42,219 --> 00:32:43,750
I heard about what happened to Captain Koo...

428
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:46,820
and the guy who did it.

429
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:48,889
Chun Ki Soo...

430
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,590
tried to hit me.

431
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:58,570
Deputy Chief Lee gave permission to shoot.

432
00:32:59,169 --> 00:33:02,770
He gave permission to shoot and kill.

433
00:33:07,379 --> 00:33:09,579
- Detective Dong. - What?

434
00:33:10,479 --> 00:33:12,519
Why do you think I'm telling you this?

435
00:33:14,979 --> 00:33:16,149
It's not just the Eraser...

436
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:19,559
that we're fighting against.

437
00:33:20,289 --> 00:33:23,729
You have way too many enemies.

438
00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:27,829
- I know. I'm used to it. - Don't be.

439
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,300
You need to stay alert.

440
00:33:29,629 --> 00:33:30,899
And there's no need to blame yourself.

441
00:33:31,829 --> 00:33:34,740
If I could have things my way, I'd keep you off this case.

442
00:33:36,669 --> 00:33:38,840
But you know I won't listen.

443
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:42,180
Yes, I know. That's why I'm telling you this.

444
00:33:42,379 --> 00:33:44,149
I'm telling you so you'll watch out.

445
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:45,919
Are you being considerate?

446
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:48,919
No, I'm giving you advice based on the information...

447
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,919
I've gathered about you.

448
00:33:53,459 --> 00:33:55,519
So you're giving me advice out of consideration? That's nice.

449
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:57,030
I'll keep it in mind.

450
00:33:57,390 --> 00:33:58,530
Thanks a lot.

451
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,800
- Where is Yoo Soon Nam? - We're trying to trace him.

452
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:04,729
All we know for now is that he left the city.

453
00:34:07,769 --> 00:34:08,999
(Situation Room)

454
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:13,280
(Situation Room)

455
00:34:16,309 --> 00:34:17,410
Hello?

456
00:34:22,919 --> 00:34:24,090
Let me go with you.

457
00:34:24,189 --> 00:34:26,660
No, I need you to stay and do something for me.

458
00:34:28,490 --> 00:34:29,590
Please do me a favor.

459
00:34:31,059 --> 00:34:33,499
I think I know where Yoo Soon Nam is. Let's go.

460
00:34:51,579 --> 00:34:52,879
Tell me the specific location.

461
00:34:52,979 --> 00:34:55,950
Yoo Soon Nam's father-in-law owns a warehouse near the river.

462
00:34:55,950 --> 00:34:57,419
And that's where his car went.

463
00:34:57,419 --> 00:34:58,990
We sent you the address via text.

464
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:01,360
The SWAT team will be there in 20 minutes.

465
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,459
Okay, thank you.

466
00:35:15,039 --> 00:35:16,240
What's the scoop?

467
00:35:17,269 --> 00:35:19,410
Detective Dong's testimony regarding the truth...

468
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:21,610
behind the Eraser's murders.

469
00:35:24,349 --> 00:35:27,950
- "Testimony"? - What if Detective Dong was framed?

470
00:35:28,419 --> 00:35:30,849
- What? - And what if the murders...

471
00:35:31,419 --> 00:35:33,490
were caused by a certain conglomerate family?

472
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:35,160
We need to watch it first.

473
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:36,459
Where is the video?

474
00:35:37,789 --> 00:35:40,660
I'm worried you might get rid of it so you could destroy Detective Dong.

475
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:43,399
- Are you kidding me? - Answer my question first.

476
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:45,329
Will you release the video...

477
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:48,140
exactly as it is?

478
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:49,709
Have you lost your mind?

479
00:35:53,939 --> 00:35:56,479
- Ji Eun. - Yes?

480
00:35:56,709 --> 00:35:58,709
What do you think is most important to a reporter?

481
00:36:01,479 --> 00:36:02,620
The truth.

482
00:36:03,189 --> 00:36:04,490
The truth is what matters.

483
00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:06,289
And we're all reporters.

484
00:36:07,289 --> 00:36:11,530
That's why we need to tell people that Detective Dong was framed.

485
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:14,499
The truth...

486
00:36:16,099 --> 00:36:19,640
doesn't come from outside. It starts from here.

487
00:36:20,599 --> 00:36:23,870
We're the ones who create the truth.

488
00:36:24,410 --> 00:36:27,410
And the truth we need to create right now...

489
00:36:28,809 --> 00:36:32,550
is to make sure that mutant disappears from this world.

490
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,419
Okay?

491
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:40,019
Ji Eun, you're still a rookie, and you don't know much.

492
00:36:40,559 --> 00:36:41,720
We'll give you one more chance.

493
00:36:41,789 --> 00:36:45,660
So stop being so stubborn and bring us the video clip.

494
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:49,099
- I can't do that. - My gosh!

495
00:36:50,169 --> 00:36:53,999
You could go to jail for using your position to gather information...

496
00:36:54,099 --> 00:36:57,110
- and keeping it to yourself. - You must be mistaken.

497
00:36:57,939 --> 00:37:00,010
I'm the one who just offered to give you one last chance.

498
00:37:02,039 --> 00:37:03,149
I'll be off now.

499
00:37:03,950 --> 00:37:05,410
Ji Eun!

500
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,780
Ji Eun, wait.

501
00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:10,050
Hey! Your life will be over...

502
00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:12,490
once we sue you for compensation and have you end up in jail!

503
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:13,820
Ji Eun!

504
00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:16,990
Darn it.

505
00:37:37,010 --> 00:37:38,649
The SWAT team is approaching the place,

506
00:37:38,649 --> 00:37:40,280
but we don't see a hostage anywhere.

507
00:37:56,669 --> 00:37:59,439
You may shoot and kill if an emergency breaks out.

508
00:37:59,899 --> 00:38:00,970
Yes, sir.

509
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:03,910
You have permission to shoot and kill.

510
00:38:57,559 --> 00:39:00,129
He's never been this obvious about his whereabouts.

511
00:39:04,729 --> 00:39:05,829
This isn't the place.

512
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:09,570
(SWAT)

513
00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:14,840
There's no one at the location.

514
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:34,700
What on earth?

515
00:39:35,899 --> 00:39:37,769
- Let's go. - Where?

516
00:39:37,769 --> 00:39:39,399
There's one more place I suspect.

517
00:39:39,399 --> 00:39:41,899
I looked into it and the professor was right.

518
00:39:41,899 --> 00:39:45,269
It's nearby where Yoo Ah Young killed herself 20 years ago...

519
00:39:45,269 --> 00:39:46,680
by carbon monoxide poisoning.

520
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:49,340
Got it. Text me the address.

521
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:50,349
Sure.

522
00:39:51,050 --> 00:39:52,780
Should I call for backup too?

523
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:56,349
Just Metro. Leave the others in the dark.

524
00:39:56,349 --> 00:39:57,450
Got it.

525
00:39:58,019 --> 00:39:59,149
How did you know?

526
00:39:59,149 --> 00:40:01,059
It's the same for most serial killers.

527
00:40:01,059 --> 00:40:03,959
Murder is a ritual to the Eraser as well.

528
00:40:03,959 --> 00:40:06,329
I knew there was a reason he came all the way here...

529
00:40:06,329 --> 00:40:07,959
even though it'd leave a trace.

530
00:40:32,689 --> 00:40:33,890
Right.

531
00:40:34,689 --> 00:40:36,260
Uncle Dong Baek...

532
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,229
You see...

533
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:42,430
I know. He's busy, right?

534
00:40:43,099 --> 00:40:44,099
Yes.

535
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:48,999
Mom said...

536
00:40:48,999 --> 00:40:51,169
that he's 10 times busier...

537
00:40:51,169 --> 00:40:53,780
because my dad got hurt.

538
00:40:55,309 --> 00:40:56,849
Yes, that's right.

539
00:40:57,749 --> 00:41:01,720
Just so you know, my dad can't do anything...

540
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:03,789
without you and Uncle Dong Baek by his side.

541
00:41:06,289 --> 00:41:08,519
Yes, that's right too.

542
00:41:11,229 --> 00:41:13,360
(Ms. Kang Ji Eun)

543
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,200
Just a second.

544
00:41:19,570 --> 00:41:22,340
Detective Oh, I need your help.

545
00:41:22,870 --> 00:41:24,610
It's for Detective Dong.

546
00:41:26,910 --> 00:41:27,910
Of course.

547
00:41:40,019 --> 00:41:41,419
(57H1019)

548
00:42:26,229 --> 00:42:27,240
Where's Eun Soo Kyung?

549
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:32,570
Darn him.

550
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:37,349
- She's still alive. - Let her go.

551
00:42:37,349 --> 00:42:39,309
Take her from me if you can.

552
00:42:39,309 --> 00:42:40,379
Yoo Soon Nam.

553
00:42:41,379 --> 00:42:43,820
What do you achieve by hurting Eun Soo Kyung anyway?

554
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:50,260
Detective Dong Baek...

555
00:42:50,990 --> 00:42:52,590
and Superintendent Han Sun Mi.

556
00:42:52,789 --> 00:42:54,430
What do you achieve...

557
00:42:54,899 --> 00:42:57,300
by saving her life then?

558
00:42:58,229 --> 00:43:01,039
A sense of relief for saving an innocent life?

559
00:43:01,539 --> 00:43:04,539
A sense of justify that's more like a mirage?

560
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:07,439
What are you trying to say?

561
00:43:07,439 --> 00:43:11,309
There was a time when those were important to me too.

562
00:43:11,479 --> 00:43:14,720
But you see, those emotions...

563
00:43:14,979 --> 00:43:18,950
only mean anything for us humans.

564
00:43:19,450 --> 00:43:20,890
Just cut the crap.

565
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:23,329
People forget too easily.

566
00:43:23,329 --> 00:43:25,490
A police officer who arrested a perp?

567
00:43:26,129 --> 00:43:28,629
A firefighter who saved a life?

568
00:43:29,059 --> 00:43:33,470
How long do you think people remember that?

569
00:43:33,970 --> 00:43:36,070
I doubt it even lasts a day.

570
00:43:37,070 --> 00:43:39,570
So why would you put yourself in danger...

571
00:43:39,570 --> 00:43:41,340
for something that'll easily be forgotten?

572
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:44,180
Isn't it a waste?

573
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:45,780
No, I'd never think that.

574
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:48,749
Actually, you've already realized...

575
00:43:49,079 --> 00:43:53,590
that your sense of justice can't change the ways of this world.

576
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:56,729
The more you try to help,

577
00:43:56,729 --> 00:44:00,200
the more the world will turn against you.

578
00:44:01,059 --> 00:44:02,430
Remove Detective Dong!

579
00:44:02,430 --> 00:44:05,229
HQ just disassembled our team.

580
00:44:05,329 --> 00:44:07,570
This is not acceptable!

581
00:44:08,370 --> 00:44:10,140
This is to humiliate you...

582
00:44:10,470 --> 00:44:13,780
in front of the camera for the whole world to see.

583
00:44:15,410 --> 00:44:16,610
Dong Baek.

584
00:44:17,410 --> 00:44:18,680
Han Sun Mi.

585
00:44:20,479 --> 00:44:23,249
In order to create a better world,

586
00:44:24,019 --> 00:44:28,360
a true leader must emerge.

587
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:31,990
Her husband, the former assemblyman.

588
00:44:32,559 --> 00:44:36,399
His crude mother who thinks money can buy everything.

589
00:44:36,729 --> 00:44:40,499
And the parasitic prosecution, police, and media outlets!

590
00:44:40,769 --> 00:44:42,999
Not those countless scumbags.

591
00:44:45,769 --> 00:44:47,979
Not those animals behind masks,

592
00:44:49,110 --> 00:44:50,709
but a true leader.

593
00:44:51,510 --> 00:44:53,320
A worshiped idol...

594
00:44:54,220 --> 00:44:57,490
and the fear that'll be brought upon...

595
00:44:57,689 --> 00:45:02,620
anyone who goes against that said hero.

596
00:45:03,289 --> 00:45:07,129
The fear generated by that hero...

597
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:10,430
is what will give birth to true justice.

598
00:45:13,499 --> 00:45:15,439
Eun Soo Kyung...

599
00:45:16,470 --> 00:45:20,309
is actually dying an honorable death.

600
00:45:20,309 --> 00:45:21,309
You scumbag...

601
00:45:26,149 --> 00:45:27,720
What are you thinking?

602
00:45:29,579 --> 00:45:31,849
Why is he using her to bargain with us?

603
00:45:34,990 --> 00:45:36,590
That's not the only odd thing.

604
00:45:37,329 --> 00:45:39,160
All this time, he avenged Moon Yong Dae...

605
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:41,030
and Yoo Ah Young in the way they were wronged.

606
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:42,729
No!

607
00:45:42,729 --> 00:45:45,629
Murder is a ritual to him. One that he's obsessed about.

608
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:49,640
He wouldn't suddenly change his way of killing.

609
00:45:50,769 --> 00:45:52,510
Eun Soo Kyung isn't in there.

610
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:55,709
Then where could she be?

611
00:45:56,809 --> 00:45:58,010
Should we make our move?

612
00:45:58,950 --> 00:46:00,979
But what if he really is the Eraser?

613
00:46:04,149 --> 00:46:06,289
Sure thing. Go ahead and kill Ms. Eun.

614
00:46:06,959 --> 00:46:08,620
I'll follow your ways.

615
00:46:09,620 --> 00:46:11,490
- Do you mean it? - Yes.

616
00:46:12,729 --> 00:46:14,899
On one condition though.

617
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:17,599
Before you kill her,

618
00:46:17,899 --> 00:46:19,999
I'd like to do a memory scan.

619
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:24,470
Bang Joon Seok and Hwang Pil Seon have messed with me too...

620
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:26,840
and I need information in order to deal with them.

621
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:29,840
You can do whatever you want afterward.

622
00:46:30,979 --> 00:46:33,280
So what do you say? Do we have a deal?

623
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:38,249
Did you really think I'd fall for your trick?

624
00:46:38,419 --> 00:46:39,590
Come on.

625
00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:41,320
If you truly are the Eraser,

626
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:44,059
you'll incapacitate us no matter what we do.

627
00:46:44,559 --> 00:46:45,559
Aren't I right?

628
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:49,559
So open the suitcase. It doesn't seem too hard to me.

629
00:46:55,499 --> 00:46:56,939
You're not the Eraser.

630
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:02,539
Take another step...

631
00:47:03,079 --> 00:47:05,309
and I'll push her over.

632
00:47:05,309 --> 00:47:07,620
It's fine. She's not in there anyway.

633
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:24,899
Eun Soo Kyung is in the building!

634
00:48:30,399 --> 00:48:32,669
Tell me. Who's the Eraser?

635
00:48:32,669 --> 00:48:33,669
It's me.

636
00:48:34,070 --> 00:48:35,439
Tell me the truth.

637
00:48:35,499 --> 00:48:38,140
It's me. I'm the Eraser!

638
00:48:38,140 --> 00:48:40,910
- Yoo Soon Nam! - All that I said to you...

639
00:48:41,010 --> 00:48:43,180
was what I heard from him.

640
00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:45,649
I wasn't here today.

641
00:48:45,649 --> 00:48:47,620
It was him...

642
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:50,050
who was here.

643
00:48:50,590 --> 00:48:52,349
You just won't give up.

644
00:48:52,349 --> 00:48:53,890
Remember...

645
00:48:54,220 --> 00:48:57,390
what you heard today.

646
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:02,360
The world cannot improve using your methods.

647
00:49:02,629 --> 00:49:05,570
And if the world doesn't improve,

648
00:49:05,769 --> 00:49:09,240
you will be nothing but an outsider...

649
00:49:09,999 --> 00:49:12,709
who is persecuted forever!

650
00:50:19,010 --> 00:50:20,840
- Chun Ki Soo, drop your gun! - Drop it!

651
00:50:27,649 --> 00:50:28,749
Drop your gun.

652
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:52,809
No!

653
00:50:56,979 --> 00:50:58,050
Hey.

654
00:50:59,050 --> 00:51:01,579
Baek! Baek! Are you okay?

655
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:05,919
Darn it. He was shot. Hurry. Call an ambulance.

656
00:51:05,919 --> 00:51:08,019
We need a medic. There's a gunshot victim on the roof.

657
00:51:34,379 --> 00:51:36,280
Baek! Wake up!

658
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:38,390
- Press on the wound! - Yes, on the roof.

659
00:51:38,390 --> 00:51:39,689
Wake up!

660
00:51:40,220 --> 00:51:42,459
Press on it!

661
00:51:50,783 --> 00:51:51,843
Yes.

662
00:51:51,843 --> 00:51:54,712
The Eraser died. Dong Baek was shot and is being transported.

663
00:51:56,082 --> 00:51:58,752
- How is he? - It won't be easy.

664
00:52:00,323 --> 00:52:02,093
- Confirm. - But...

665
00:52:03,692 --> 00:52:05,393
the NIS suddenly showed up.

666
00:52:18,942 --> 00:52:20,073
What should we do?

667
00:52:21,013 --> 00:52:23,073
- Follow them discreetly. - Yes, sir.

668
00:52:28,852 --> 00:52:29,982
Where?

669
00:52:30,683 --> 00:52:33,082
- Right now? - Take it down right away, please.

670
00:52:33,252 --> 00:52:36,152
Please. We need it down by this evening.

671
00:52:36,453 --> 00:52:37,663
Oh no.

672
00:52:38,022 --> 00:52:39,422
That's...

673
00:52:43,902 --> 00:52:47,203
In this video, Detective Dong Baek tells us the truth...

674
00:52:47,502 --> 00:52:49,272
- regarding the Eraser. - Hello, Madam Chairman.

675
00:52:49,933 --> 00:52:51,743
I'd like to make a statement.

676
00:52:52,873 --> 00:52:57,243
Based on the memories that I saw while hunting the Eraser,

677
00:52:58,643 --> 00:53:01,982
it's a story that began long ago.

678
00:53:03,252 --> 00:53:04,382
20 years ago.

679
00:53:05,382 --> 00:53:09,053
The scumbag who trampled on and killed innocent young people,

680
00:53:09,223 --> 00:53:12,863
and the mom who caused the deaths of their surviving families...

681
00:53:13,493 --> 00:53:16,433
in order to hide her child's sins.

682
00:53:18,533 --> 00:53:19,663
They are...

683
00:53:21,073 --> 00:53:24,073
the real cause that brought about Eun Soo Kyung's suffering.

684
00:53:25,243 --> 00:53:27,172
Former assemblyman Bang Joon Seok...

685
00:53:29,343 --> 00:53:30,812
and Chairwoman Hwang Pil Seon.

686
00:53:33,082 --> 00:53:34,113
And...

687
00:53:35,553 --> 00:53:37,252
Deputy Chief Chun Ki Soo,

688
00:53:37,252 --> 00:53:38,922
who followed their orders and covered up the crimes,

689
00:53:40,623 --> 00:53:41,752
(Detective Dong Baek's Statement Regarding the Eraser Case)

690
00:53:41,752 --> 00:53:42,893
and Lee Shin Woong,

691
00:53:44,192 --> 00:53:45,663
the deputy chief of the National Police Agency.

692
00:53:47,363 --> 00:53:50,803
They bribed many people in order to cover up the murder...

693
00:53:51,062 --> 00:53:54,573
and rape committed by Bang Joon Seok and his friends.

694
00:53:55,672 --> 00:53:58,902
They fabricated false testimonies and disguised a murder as a suicide.

695
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:02,013
Moreover, they said unspeakable things to the rape victim,

696
00:54:02,113 --> 00:54:04,312
who was just a student at the time,

697
00:54:04,812 --> 00:54:06,812
and killed the girl...

698
00:54:07,352 --> 00:54:08,712
over and over.

699
00:54:10,382 --> 00:54:13,593
Chun Ki Soo, who covered up the murder on their orders,

700
00:54:15,192 --> 00:54:16,252
and Lee Shin Woong,

701
00:54:18,093 --> 00:54:19,562
the deputy chief of the National Police Agency.

702
00:54:20,593 --> 00:54:22,593
Take down what you posted online right this instant.

703
00:54:23,263 --> 00:54:25,263
No, I will not.

704
00:54:25,502 --> 00:54:28,433
Ji Eun. Do you think you'll get away with this?

705
00:54:29,703 --> 00:54:30,902
I have no choice.

706
00:54:31,772 --> 00:54:35,373
The most important thing for a journalist is the truth.

707
00:54:35,373 --> 00:54:36,513
Hey, Ji Eun!

708
00:54:40,113 --> 00:54:41,212
Nice.

709
00:54:42,652 --> 00:54:44,022
You're super cool.

710
00:54:45,283 --> 00:54:47,393
I'm cool and unemployed.

711
00:54:48,522 --> 00:54:49,922
I should do that too.

712
00:54:50,462 --> 00:54:51,623
To Baek...

713
00:54:54,292 --> 00:54:56,632
and to Captain Koo. I should talk to them like that too.

714
00:54:57,303 --> 00:54:58,632
Call me when you get fired.

715
00:55:00,102 --> 00:55:01,203
Okay.

716
00:55:02,002 --> 00:55:04,573
(Dong Baek's Statement)

717
00:55:04,743 --> 00:55:06,303
Do you think Baek will be okay?

718
00:55:06,843 --> 00:55:09,973
Well, he looks completely not okay, but still.

719
00:55:10,513 --> 00:55:11,712
He'll be okay.

720
00:55:12,283 --> 00:55:15,783
He has a lot of people rooting for him.

721
00:55:18,082 --> 00:55:21,922
Still, Had I known he went to the scene, I would've gone too.

722
00:55:24,192 --> 00:55:26,462
He needs someone there to hold him back.

723
00:55:27,462 --> 00:55:30,062
You're worried he'll get hurt, aren't you?

724
00:55:31,363 --> 00:55:34,232
No. In case he beats someone up.

725
00:55:36,832 --> 00:55:38,272
He doesn't get hurt easily.

726
00:55:38,602 --> 00:55:42,212
Even if he does, he gets right up and yanks out the IV needle and...

727
00:55:42,973 --> 00:55:44,113
And...

728
00:55:44,913 --> 00:55:48,382
Superintendent Han went with him, so I'm sure he's fine.

729
00:55:49,053 --> 00:55:50,152
I guess so, right?

730
00:56:15,513 --> 00:56:16,613
What are you doing?

731
00:56:16,982 --> 00:56:19,082
Take that video down right now!

732
00:56:19,413 --> 00:56:21,752
It's on servers in other countries too.

733
00:56:22,053 --> 00:56:23,413
We'll find a way.

734
00:56:28,453 --> 00:56:30,152
Darn it.

735
00:56:37,763 --> 00:56:38,933
Darn it.

736
00:56:43,843 --> 00:56:44,942
Mr. Cho.

737
00:56:58,422 --> 00:56:59,783
What do you think you're doing?

738
00:57:03,422 --> 00:57:06,022
I warned you 20 years ago.

739
00:57:06,792 --> 00:57:08,192
That if you don't get your act together,

740
00:57:09,132 --> 00:57:11,002
you'll rot in jail for the rest of your life.

741
00:57:11,703 --> 00:57:13,232
Do you think you'll get away with this?

742
00:57:13,232 --> 00:57:14,232
Stop.

743
00:57:16,102 --> 00:57:17,373
We need to fix it first.

744
00:57:17,643 --> 00:57:18,803
It's impossible...

745
00:57:19,942 --> 00:57:23,113
to make it like none of it happened.

746
00:57:25,613 --> 00:57:27,252
Nothing is impossible for me.

747
00:57:28,712 --> 00:57:30,053
Not in this country.

748
00:57:31,723 --> 00:57:35,652
Just do as you've always done. Just follow my orders!

749
00:57:37,062 --> 00:57:38,893
- I make the decisions. - No.

750
00:57:39,962 --> 00:57:43,033
I'll take care of it using my methods.

751
00:57:44,203 --> 00:57:45,303
This is...

752
00:57:46,163 --> 00:57:48,303
no longer just your family's problem.

753
00:57:49,772 --> 00:57:51,073
It's my problem as well.

754
00:57:57,482 --> 00:58:00,613
You're going to cut ties with me...

755
00:58:00,613 --> 00:58:02,953
now that the situation isn't in your favor?

756
00:58:04,553 --> 00:58:08,792
Do you think you're the only person who works for me in this country?

757
00:58:08,792 --> 00:58:10,053
Did you forget...

758
00:58:14,832 --> 00:58:16,533
who helped you get this far?

759
00:58:37,382 --> 00:58:41,292
Detective Dong, who fell unconscious after he got shot 15 days ago,

760
00:58:41,292 --> 00:58:44,393
is known to be in a very critical situation.

761
00:58:44,393 --> 00:58:46,323
According to his doctors,

762
00:58:46,323 --> 00:58:49,533
Detective Dong still hasn't regained his consciousness.

763
00:58:49,533 --> 00:58:52,732
And the foreign doctors who came to treat him...

764
00:58:52,732 --> 00:58:57,172
are also very pessimistic about his recovery.

765
00:59:16,252 --> 00:59:18,593
Are you going to keep staring at me like that?

766
00:59:22,692 --> 00:59:23,832
Are you okay?

767
00:59:29,203 --> 00:59:30,203
Of course.

768
00:59:35,743 --> 00:59:36,812
Did you think...

769
00:59:37,613 --> 00:59:39,812
I wouldn't be okay?

770
00:59:40,982 --> 00:59:43,413
But according to the news...

771
00:59:44,082 --> 00:59:45,223
Did they say I'm going to die?

772
00:59:50,123 --> 00:59:51,692
You moved the public.

773
00:59:52,263 --> 00:59:54,292
It looks like there's going to be a special prosecution...

774
00:59:54,292 --> 00:59:55,663
for Hwang Pil Seon and Bang Joon Seok.

775
00:59:56,632 --> 00:59:58,102
But of course, it won't be easy.

776
00:59:59,663 --> 01:00:01,502
Everything will turn out great.

777
01:00:02,303 --> 01:00:04,272
Your testimony played a big role.

778
01:00:10,073 --> 01:00:11,082
What's the matter?

779
01:00:13,312 --> 01:00:16,812
Something suddenly came to mind.

780
01:00:18,623 --> 01:00:19,623
What?

781
01:00:19,882 --> 01:00:23,022
I started to wonder if things would've come this far...

782
01:00:23,352 --> 01:00:25,763
if I didn't end up getting hurt.

783
01:00:29,093 --> 01:00:31,933
I tried so hard to make this happen.

784
01:00:32,462 --> 01:00:33,832
But it's proceeding a lot faster...

785
01:00:34,272 --> 01:00:37,172
now that people think I'm about to die.

786
01:00:38,843 --> 01:00:39,843
Do you really think...

787
01:00:40,243 --> 01:00:42,542
The more you try to help,

788
01:00:42,812 --> 01:00:45,442
the more the world will turn against you.

789
01:00:45,442 --> 01:00:49,013
You will be nothing but an outsider...

790
01:00:49,582 --> 01:00:51,982
who is persecuted forever!

791
01:00:52,553 --> 01:00:56,022
Do you really think I'll be loved once I disappear from this world?

792
01:01:00,632 --> 01:01:03,692
I couldn't stop thinking about what he said to me.

793
01:01:07,132 --> 01:01:09,132
You should get some rest.

794
01:01:10,102 --> 01:01:12,172
Stop worrying about that. It doesn't suit you.

795
01:01:12,373 --> 01:01:14,312
Just focus on recovering so you can return to work.

796
01:01:31,893 --> 01:01:32,893
Hey.

797
01:01:33,323 --> 01:01:34,332
Hey!

798
01:01:37,303 --> 01:01:38,303
What?

799
01:01:39,732 --> 01:01:41,232
Are you Detective Dong?

800
01:01:52,812 --> 01:01:54,453
(If you want to know the truth, let's meet where it all started.)

801
01:03:52,902 --> 01:03:54,232
Seo Hui Soo.

802
01:04:00,272 --> 01:04:03,772
I will start by telling you the truth.

803
01:04:05,442 --> 01:04:06,442
Dong Baek.

804
01:04:07,453 --> 01:04:08,613
My little brother.

805
01:04:50,323 --> 01:04:53,163
(Memorist)

806
01:04:53,663 --> 01:04:55,263
This document is about a person with supernatural powers.

807
01:04:55,263 --> 01:04:57,462
Someone other than Detective Dong.

808
01:04:57,462 --> 01:04:59,732
Trace Detective Dong's location. Hurry.

809
01:04:59,832 --> 01:05:02,703
Tell me everything you know.

810
01:05:03,533 --> 01:05:05,042
How can I believe you?

811
01:05:05,643 --> 01:05:06,873
That's when...

812
01:05:07,913 --> 01:05:09,272
I realized something.

813
01:05:09,272 --> 01:05:10,743
That's why you killed people...

814
01:05:11,482 --> 01:05:12,843
and started taking revenge?

815
01:05:13,513 --> 01:05:14,812
If you think I'm a monster,

816
01:05:14,812 --> 01:05:16,212
just kill me. Kill me!

817
01:05:16,212 --> 01:05:17,683
It's over now.

818
01:05:17,683 --> 01:05:20,082
Shut your mouth and watch. This is just the beginning.
