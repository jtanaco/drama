20

<b>You're showing interest

22

<b>You two seemed so close,

23
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:58,799
<b>Is there a story I'm not aware of?</b>

24
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:03,400
<b>I don't care about
your story with Director Myeong.</b>

25
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,340
<b>Should I start to show interest?</b>

26
00:02:07,739 --> 00:02:09,370
<b>Now I'm getting curious.</b>

27
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:20,379
<b>Let's go.</b>

28

<b>A crow landed on the puppet CEO.</b>

29
00:02:38,129 --> 00:02:39,169
<b>How amusing.</b>

30
00:02:42,009 --> 00:02:43,240
<b>Why did this break...</b>

31
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,479
<b>and make me toss food on the floor?</b>

32
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,879
<b>Is this all he eats?</b>

33
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:59,090
<b>(Chief Tak, ETA, three minutes.)</b>

34

36

<b>What does she want me to find?</b>

37
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:09,659
<b>There's absolutely nothing to...</b>

38
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,480
<b>"8:30 p.m. on the 15th".</b>

<b>"Red Purple"?</b>

40
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:34,350
<b>I looked into it.</b>

41
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:37,420
<b>And Red Purple is
a private wine bar.</b>

42
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:39,519
<b>All members need to make
a reservation beforehand.</b>

43
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:41,420
<b>And they protect
their guests' privacy at all costs.</b>

44
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:44,930
<b>That means he met someone in secret.</b>

45
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:49,230
<b>But why are you suddenly
so interested in Chief Tak?</b>

46
00:04:50,629 --> 00:04:53,000
<b>Because he might be Michael.</b>

47
00:04:54,069 --> 00:04:55,370
<b>Chief Tak?</b>

48
00:05:04,579 --> 00:05:06,850
<b>If Chief Tak
turns out to be Michael,</b>

49
00:05:07,149 --> 00:05:10,290
<b>he would've met someone
prior to the transaction.</b>

50
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:12,759
<b>Then do you think the transaction
took place at Red Purple?</b>

51
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:15,430
<b>Let's check the security footage.</b>

52
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:18,259
<b>The place opens at 7 p.m.</b>

53

<b>The blinds don't work properly

<b>The machines in my office

79

<b>And the rail for the bookshelf too.</b>

80

<b>Sometimes, it doesn't work.</b>

81

<b>Did the new secretary go home?</b>

82

<b>What a great life.</b>

<b>Kang Woo Won is the most

<b>No wonder he asked

96

00:44:51,510 --> 00:44:52,880
<b>so it's a bit of a nuisance.</b>

470
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:55,510
<b>What if we lose them?</b>

471
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:57,610
<b>They're heading to Pocheon,</b>

472
00:44:57,610 --> 00:44:59,079
<b>so the destination
must be an abandoned factory.</b>

473
00:44:59,420 --> 00:45:00,449
<b>Let's go.</b>

474
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:09,260
<b>What on earth?</b>

475
00:45:26,539 --> 00:45:28,210
<b>Mr. Dong, it's me!</b>

476
00:45:28,679 --> 00:45:29,849
<b>Please open the door.</b>

477
00:45:29,849 --> 00:45:31,010
<b>- Hey!
- Mr. Dong.</b>

478
00:45:31,610 --> 00:45:34,019
<b>Why that... Unbelievable.</b>

479
00:45:36,219 --> 00:45:39,059
<b>Where on earth were you?</b>

480
00:45:39,460 --> 00:45:40,460
<b>What was that?</b>

481
00:45:41,619 --> 00:45:43,289
<b>Keep following us, okay?</b>

482
00:45:43,289 --> 00:45:44,889
<b>We can't hear a word you're saying.</b>

483
00:45:44,889 --> 00:45:47,099
<b>Keep following the truck.</b>

484
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:48,599
<b>Got it?</b>

485
00:45:48,829 --> 00:45:50,530
<b>I didn't understand any of that.</b>

486
00:45:50,530 --> 00:45:52,769
<b>- Come on.
- What are you doing?</b>

487
00:45:54,739 --> 00:45:56,739
<b>- Hey, NIS guy.
- What are you doing?</b>

488
00:45:56,739 --> 00:45:57,909
<b>Keep your eyes on the road!</b>

489
00:45:58,480 --> 00:45:59,539
<b>It hurts.</b>

490
00:45:59,579 --> 00:46:00,610
<b>- Mu Hyeok!
- Pull me up.</b>

491
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:03,179
<b>Let go of me!</b>

492
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:06,579
<b>- Help me get in there.
- Let go of her.</b>

493
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:11,150
<b>Guys, watch the bus ahead!</b>

494
00:46:11,150 --> 00:46:12,860
<b>The bus, darn it!</b>

495
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:24,599
<b>My gosh.</b>

496
00:46:56,429 --> 00:46:58,800
<b>Should I break their legs?</b>

497
00:46:59,769 --> 00:47:01,300
<b>Did you see him flinch like a baby?</b>

498
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:28,969
<b>Pi Cheol Woong.</b>

499
00:47:31,269 --> 00:47:32,340
<b>Pi Cheol Woong?</b>

500
00:47:32,340 --> 00:47:34,800
<b>No, that's not me.</b>

501
00:47:35,070 --> 00:47:38,309
<b>I doubt you stole from us
without being prepared to die.</b>

502
00:47:38,369 --> 00:47:39,380
<b>Right?</b>

503
00:47:39,380 --> 00:47:41,539
<b>No, I'm not Pi Cheol Woong.</b>

504
00:47:42,010 --> 00:47:43,280
<b>Say something, darn it.</b>

505
00:47:50,190 --> 00:47:51,960
<b>No, that's worth
over 100,000 dollars,</b>

506
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:53,659
<b>you scumbag!</b>

507
00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:33,599
<b>I requested for backup,</b>

508
00:48:34,429 --> 00:48:35,900
<b>so be our eyes out here.</b>

509
00:48:40,570 --> 00:48:41,570
<b>Gosh.</b>

510
00:49:33,289 --> 00:49:34,460
<b>Let me make this clear.</b>

511
00:49:35,289 --> 00:49:38,590
<b>If Michael is here, he's all mine.</b>

512
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:43,099
<b>I understand
your desire for Michael,</b>

513
00:49:43,199 --> 00:49:45,599
<b>but let me remind you
that this is a mission.</b>

514
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:47,440
<b>I won't tolerate anyone going rogue.</b>

515
00:51:14,489 --> 00:51:15,829
<b>You're making my ears bleed.</b>

516
00:52:03,070 --> 00:52:05,039
<b>Guys!</b>

517
00:52:09,980 --> 00:52:12,519
<b>- Look.
- I see we have company.</b>

518
00:52:13,019 --> 00:52:14,420
<b>It's just the two of them.</b>

519
00:52:17,119 --> 00:52:20,320
<b>Guys!</b>

520
00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:22,590
<b>Ye Eun!</b>

521
00:52:23,230 --> 00:52:24,489
<b>Consider this...</b>

522
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:26,730
<b>your last day.</b>

523
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:12,570
<b>Let go of me.</b>

524
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:15,739
<b>Darn, that stings!</b>

525
00:54:35,090 --> 00:54:36,989
<b>Guys, we have a runner.</b>

526
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:05,960
<b>Are you all right?</b>

527
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:08,289
<b>How long have you been on the floor?</b>

528
00:55:08,289 --> 00:55:09,489
<b>Guys...</b>

529
00:55:30,610 --> 00:55:32,579
<b>I rarely pull my gun,</b>

530
00:55:34,019 --> 00:55:36,219
<b>but guys who hurt my team...</b>

531
00:55:37,050 --> 00:55:38,820
<b>definitely deserve the bullets.</b>

532
00:55:40,260 --> 00:55:41,289
<b>Sorry about that.</b>

533
00:55:42,090 --> 00:55:43,460
<b>Calling you a guy was sexist of me.</b>

534
00:56:48,289 --> 00:56:52,059
<b>(Stay tuned for the epilogue.)</b>

535

<b>(Epilogue)</b>

536
00:57:12,679 --> 00:57:14,150
<b>He said...</b>

537
00:57:14,150 --> 00:57:16,420
<b>that he'd only talk to you...</b>

538
00:57:16,420 --> 00:57:18,349
<b>about the details of this contract.</b>

539
00:57:28,699 --> 00:57:30,730
<b>Hello, Mr. Kang,</b>

540
00:57:30,829 --> 00:57:34,269
<b>I'm Lim Ye Eun
from Il Kwang Hitech.</b>

541
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:38,269
<b>I mean, Lim Jung Eun.</b>

542
00:57:40,110 --> 00:57:41,539
<b>Surprise!</b>

543
00:57:44,980 --> 00:57:46,650
<b>What a pain in the neck.</b>

544
00:57:47,550 --> 00:57:49,789
<b>Just the type that I hate.</b>

545
00:57:52,690 --> 00:57:54,219
<b>Wait, did that seem fake?</b>

546
00:57:55,159 --> 00:57:57,690
<b>I'm Lim Jung Eun
from the Advertising Department.</b>

547
00:57:57,989 --> 00:57:59,630
<b>I heard that you asked for me.</b>

548
00:57:59,630 --> 00:58:01,699
<b>That I did.
What are you going to do about it?</b>

549
00:58:01,699 --> 00:58:03,869
<b>I knew that
a top celebrity like you...</b>

550
00:58:04,170 --> 00:58:07,039
<b>wouldn't be petty enough...</b>

551
00:58:07,039 --> 00:58:09,840
<b>to back out of
an existing contract...</b>

552
00:58:09,940 --> 00:58:11,670
<b>over something so trivial.</b>

553
00:58:12,469 --> 00:58:15,010
<b>What? Something so trivial?</b>

554
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:16,650
<b>If I'm being honest,</b>

555
00:58:16,650 --> 00:58:18,949
<b>what happened wasn't on purpose.</b>

556
00:58:19,519 --> 00:58:21,550
<b>It only happened because...</b>

557
00:58:21,550 --> 00:58:23,820
<b>I was trying my best
to close this deal with you.</b>

558
00:58:24,449 --> 00:58:26,860
<b>Only someone
so small-minded and spiteful...</b>

559
00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:29,590
<b>would use it to leverage
a higher signing bonus.</b>

560
00:58:30,159 --> 00:58:31,659
<b>How could you be so mean?</b>

561
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:33,860
<b>What? Unbelievable.</b>

562
00:58:34,630 --> 00:58:36,570
<b>You're insane, aren't you?</b>

563
00:58:44,139 --> 00:58:47,840
<b>If only you had the guts
to actually say that to his face.</b>

564
00:58:48,679 --> 00:58:52,250
<b>Whatever I say
is nothing but an excuse anyway.</b>

565
00:58:52,579 --> 00:58:55,750
<b>I'd be that mean too
if I were in his shoes.</b>

566
00:58:56,349 --> 00:58:59,389
<b>If only I took the advice
and did a better job.</b>

567
00:58:59,659 --> 00:59:02,190
<b>I totally deserve
his hostility toward me.</b>

568
00:59:06,130 --> 00:59:07,599
<b>How can someone like me...</b>

569
00:59:08,860 --> 00:59:11,769
<b>negotiate a deal with
a top celebrity anyway?</b>

570
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:16,010
<b>I took on a task
that was above my paygrade.</b>

571
00:59:16,670 --> 00:59:18,940
<b>What now?</b>

572
00:59:19,139 --> 00:59:21,780
<b>She'll fire me
if I don't get him to sign the deal.</b>

573
01:00:17,869 --> 01:00:19,599
<b>(Good Casting)</b>

574
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:21,139
<b>Let the police handle it
and step aside.</b>

575
01:00:21,139 --> 01:00:23,039
<b>You'll be happy with
what you find in the trunk.</b>

576
01:00:23,039 --> 01:00:24,610
<b>Your wish is my command, sir.</b>

577
01:00:24,610 --> 01:00:26,409
<b>Do what you have to do.
I trust your judgment, Chief.</b>

578
01:00:26,409 --> 01:00:28,880
<b>Chief! Why did you pick me
for this mission?</b>

579
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:30,849
<b>- Where am I?
- He has amnesia?</b>

580
01:00:30,849 --> 01:00:32,820
<b>- Found him.
- Pi Cheol Woong has been located.</b>

581
01:00:32,820 --> 01:00:34,019
<b>In Taipei?</b>

582
01:00:34,019 --> 01:00:35,679
<b>It sure is a good day to fly.</b>

583
01:00:35,679 --> 01:00:36,920
<b>Don't you dare drag them.</b>

584
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:37,989
<b>I'll look for it.</b>

585
01:00:37,989 --> 01:00:40,090
<b>- Ma'am!
- Is it jammed?</b>

586
01:00:41,190 --> 01:00:42,360
<b>It's about Baek Chan Mi.</b>

587
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:43,590
<b>There's no record of her return.</b>

588
01:00:43,590 --> 01:00:45,730
<b>A fish that can't be seen
can still stick up the place.</b>

589
01:00:45,730 --> 01:00:47,530
<b>- He's on the plane.
- Why did you play dumb...</b>

590
01:00:47,530 --> 01:00:48,630
<b>when you knew who I was?</b>

591
01:00:48,630 --> 01:00:50,969
<b>It's you, isn't it? You're Michael.</b>
