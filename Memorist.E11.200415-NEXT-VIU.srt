This place reeks of it even at this very moment.

Do it now. Shoot! Hurry up and shoot!

00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,960
that you recognize a lowly managing prosecutor...

169
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,760
whom your underlings disrespect.

170
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,630
How could I not know the next Public Prosecutor General?

171
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:40,170
You were promoted to the Central Prosecutors' Office.

172
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:44,370
You survived Im Joong Yeon's scandal unscathed.

173
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:48,880
I forgot a warrant.

174
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:50,650
- Mr. Kim. - Yes, sir.

175
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:52,180
Go to the courthouse and get another warrant.

176
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:54,180
Include the deputy chief's office in the search.

177
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,650
What do you think you're doing?

178
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:59,120
- Should we talk in my office? - Why? Scared?

179
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,660
Why you little...

180
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:05,230
I understand you are passionate,

181
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:07,930
but you should show dignity.

182
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:11,470
We prosecutors don't care about dignity...

183
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:13,140
in front of suspects like them.

184
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:16,170
He isn't worth your time, sir.

185
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,010
- What? - Want to make a bet?

186
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:20,640
That you leave empty-handed...

187
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,710
Is that a joke?

188
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:25,920
I heard you were present last time...

189
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:29,090
when they came to arrest Detective Dong Baek.

190
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:32,420
- Move. - Hold on.

191
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:34,420
This isn't the time...

192
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,160
What about it?

193
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:40,160
You must know what the problem is.

194
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:41,760
I do not.

195
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:44,330
I won't make an issue of it if you leave quietly.

196
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:45,970
I can't do that.

197
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:48,040
Send them the documents they need later.

198
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:50,610
- Yes, sir. - You're quite the comedian.

199
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:52,110
You'll take responsibility...

200
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:56,480
for assaulting a suspect, is that it?

201
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,150
(Assaulting a suspect is punishable by up to 5 years in prison.)

202
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:00,350
And you have proof?

203
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:02,180
Shall we make a bet...

204
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:05,090
whether I'm bluffing without evidence,

205
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:08,790
or whether I have a high-resolution video?

206
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:10,660
There's no way you do,

207
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,760
but do you think they'd care even if you did?

208
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,640
True. The prosecutors solely have the authority...

209
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,270
to indict a suspect.

210
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:25,780
However, if that heinous video were aired on the news,

211
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:29,210
even if you evade indictment,

212
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:31,450
you'll lose your job for sure.

213
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:33,120
Prosecutors...

214
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:37,350
who get involved in scandals end up going into the private sector.

215
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:40,190
Are you challenging me?

216
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:42,830
Want to make a bet?

217
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:45,830
Whether you'll leave quietly,

218
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:50,000
or whether we'll duke it out, no-holds barred?

219
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,380
Pull out.

220
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:04,810
Excuse me?

221
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:08,780
- Remove the boxes. - Yes, sir.

222
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,560
You're just as I've heard.

223
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,760
I'll be seeing you again soon.

224
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,280
I'm sorry, sir.

225
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:36,180
Report to the Prosecutors' Office.

226
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:38,150
Resign before then.

227
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:41,480
I will, but please give me one week to investigate first.

228
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,250
- No, just three days... - Han Sun Mi.

229
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,960
- Yes, sir. - Do you know...

230
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,820
the top cause of the death of soldiers during a war?

231
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:53,400
Stupid leaders.

232
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,130
Just like you.

233
00:16:57,530 --> 00:17:00,140
The Metropolitan Investigation Unit was humiliated because of you.

234
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:01,970
No. The entire police department.

235
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:04,040
And yet, you still can't let go?

236
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:08,510
You're a lawyer even if you quit, but not the others.

237
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:13,280
It's my duty to make sure they can feed their families.

238
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:18,420
If you keep resisting and holding on regardless,

239
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:21,320
Young Soo will be fired too. Is that what you want?

240
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:22,660
No, sir.

241
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:24,490
If you understood,

242
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:26,500
act accordingly.

243
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,740
You're home late.

244
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,250
Did you read my door code too?

245
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:24,790
What else did you peek at from my memories?

246
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:27,490
What do you take me for?

247
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,860
The four keys have your prints all over them.

248
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:32,290
You're such a careless profiler.

249
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:36,130
Stop scowling, will you?

250
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,700
I came because I was worried that the Eraser would be after you.

251
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:42,440
Once I die, everyone will know who the Eraser is.

252
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:45,210
You know you don't need to worry, so leave.

253
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:47,140
I have nowhere to go.

254
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:50,380
Woo Seok Do put out an APB on me, so they're at my home and at hotels.

255
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:55,050
He killed my mother.

256
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:04,030
I remember it very clearly.

257
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:07,530
You cried like a little baby in front of your dying mother.

258
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:11,800
I don't care who dies. I'm going to see an end to this.

259
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:15,440
How will you see an end to it?

260
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:19,780
He has been killing only infamous villains like the Executioner.

261
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:22,140
- But? - There was one exception.

262
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:24,380
Shimbae.

263
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:27,420
The decisive clue is in the Shimbae incident.

264
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:30,250
The reason the Eraser had to kill seven people.

265
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:32,620
Once I find that reason,

266
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:36,360
we'll be able to uncover the Eraser's real identity,

267
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:39,130
and why he had to kill them even if it meant revealing his power.

268
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,370
I need your help.

269
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:48,700
I've been kicked out...

270
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:51,770
thanks to somebody losing the perp.

271
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:53,540
You're the one who lost him.

272
00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:55,510
I risked my life and chased him.

273
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:57,380
It's my fault for trusting you.

274
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:59,350
Such an attitude. Anyway.

275
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,720
What I need isn't your title,

276
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:04,050
but your brain.

277
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,690
Didn't you say your brain was the best in the world?

278
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:08,820
Of course, I'm as smart as Sherlock Holmes.

279
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:10,360
But you have your strengths too.

280
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:11,890
For example?

281
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:14,260
Knowledge of criminal law which I do not have.

282
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,900
And logical reasoning using an exceptional brain.

283
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:18,130
Do you admit I'm top-notch?

284
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:21,170
I'm saying you have strengths and weaknesses.

285
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:27,640
Jin Jae Gyu made a dying statement.

286
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:30,410
What?

287
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,780
The Eraser is hiding...

288
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:39,290
in Dong Baek's past.

289
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:42,260
What past?

290
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:45,730
The past?

291
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:47,900
Is that all?

292
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,270
All the leads led to dead ends.

293
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:57,410
Along with my childhood memories that I lost.

294
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:02,950
Anyway, what we need to dig into isn't my past,

295
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:04,380
but the Shimbae incident.

296
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,550
Do you really think that's the past where the Eraser is hiding?

297
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:12,090
If he meant your mom's death,

298
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:15,390
it would be meaningless since we all know about it.

299
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:17,890
- But... - But?

300
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:19,400
From what I saw...

301
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:21,400
Don't care about me! Just hurry up and shoot!

302
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:24,000
He wouldn't leave behind a meaningless dying message.

303
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:26,970
It looks like you're empathizing...

304
00:22:27,170 --> 00:22:28,400
with Jin Jae Gyu's death.

305
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,170
The pain you had to go through...

306
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:33,240
is part of my karma.

307
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,380
He might be...

308
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:39,850
referring to a memory that was never erased.

309
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:44,920
So you're saying the Eraser might exist...

310
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,120
in my memory?

311
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,560
Does that even make sense?

312
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:52,130
You either didn't notice because it was so common.

313
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:53,830
- Or... - Or what?

314
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:55,700
Or it was too shocking...

315
00:22:56,530 --> 00:22:59,030
that you failed to notice the surroundings.

316
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:03,170
That's where the Eraser is hiding.

317
00:23:04,410 --> 00:23:06,010
I failed to notice...

318
00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:10,480
because it was too shocking?

319
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:15,450
(8 years ago)

320
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,720
A shocking moment...

321
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:26,130
that made me forget about everything else.

322
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:33,800
The rooftop I went to when I was 19.

323
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:08,440
Can you do it somewhere else?

324
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:16,210
I heard taking off your shoes is a message...

325
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:18,650
asking people to notice your death.

326
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:20,980
Is that what it is?

327
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,050
No, that's not it.

328
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:26,760
Can you do it somewhere else? This is my spot.

329
00:24:57,150 --> 00:25:00,090
Ms. Han, Dong Baek has put you through a lot, hasn't he?

330
00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:03,990
You punk. Look how exhausted she is because of you.

331
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:07,130
He really has a way of tiring people out.

332
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:11,530
- You haven't eaten yet, have you? - Were you being tailed?

333
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,570
- No, of course not. - We're professionals.

334
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,870
Can you explain this situation?

335
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:22,510
You didn't ask her for permission?

336
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:25,310
I was just about to ask, but you suddenly showed up.

337
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:32,590
Ms. Han, we have new information.

338
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:36,530
Yes, we have important information.

339
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:38,460
I'm so starving.

340
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:41,000
So I forgot to tell you.

341
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,370
Excuse me.

342
00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:53,940
It's an emergency situation.

343
00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:01,050
We checked the people who died at Shimbae City.

344
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,290
Not everyone lived at Shimbae City,

345
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:05,220
and they were all going to different universities.

346
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:06,860
So it's weird that they all died on the same day and time.

347
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:08,020
And?

348
00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:09,830
But they all had something in common.

349
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:12,890
- What's that? - Private tutoring.

350
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,900
It turns out they received private tutoring in a small group...

351
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,370
ever since they were in kindergarten.

352
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:20,970
Our team already knew that.

353
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,070
- That's amazing. - I see.

354
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:29,010
The family of the deceased are all pretty rich and powerful.

355
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:32,010
But none of them were willing to answer our questions.

356
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,680
- Why not? - How would I know?

357
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:37,820
So what is it that you found out?

358
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:39,790
Baek, isn't it weird?

359
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:42,320
They were only 20 years old, and 7 of them died.

360
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,660
But not a single family complained about their deaths.

361
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:46,160
And?

362
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:50,300
But there was one guy that caught my eye among the seven kids.

363
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,300
(Personal Details of the Deceased)

364
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,140
- "So Philip"? - Yes.

365
00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:01,480
I remembered where I saw that name.

366
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:03,750
- Where? - Don't you remember?

367
00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:07,580
You asked me and Captain Koo to find information on the cold case.

368
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,950
- The SMPA archives? - Yes.

369
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,850
I saw his name on one of the official documents.

370
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:14,860
(Suffocated to death, So Philip and 6 more)

371
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:16,290
It's an unusual name.

372
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:17,930
"So Philip".

373
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:19,900
(Special Investigations Unit for Cold Cases)

374
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:21,060
But it doesn't make sense.

375
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,670
No one did an internal investigation regarding the Shimbae City case.

376
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:27,040
Then why did they ask for the internal investigation results?

377
00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:29,470
That means someone erased...

378
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:32,610
all the remaining traces of the investigation.

379
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:34,980
You need to be really brave...

380
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:37,210
to have the guts to erase police records.

381
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:39,920
I wonder what it was that the person was trying to hide.

382
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:42,120
"Chun Ki Soo"?

383
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,550
You're Kim So Mi?

384
00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:47,660
The girl from six years ago?

385
00:27:50,530 --> 00:27:51,930
What an interesting connection.

386
00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:56,130
The team leader back then was a guy I know named Chun Ki Soo.

387
00:27:56,130 --> 00:27:58,530
Old Man, you told me you know him, right?

388
00:27:58,770 --> 00:28:01,170
I called him earlier, but he told me he took the day off.

389
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:02,670
So I agreed to meet him tomorrow morning.

390
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:05,010
Do you think he got rid of the investigation records?

391
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:06,480
We'll find out.

392
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:09,850
Maybe he was onto something.

393
00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:12,810
Let's see how much of this he knows.

394
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:14,480
Good job.

395
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,280
Gosh, you're embarrassing me.

396
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,590
What about me?

397
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,760
What do you say? How about a joint investigation?

398
00:28:23,290 --> 00:28:24,760
You guys can stay just for tonight.

399
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:30,930
Without her, we can't call ourselves the Avengers.

400
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,050
Oh, no.

401
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:48,120
Stop. No.

402
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:53,990
Help me.

403
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:32,030
Why do you keep following me around?

404
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:37,300
I didn't follow you around.

405
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:38,970
You're so lame.

406
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:41,200
Don't... Don't do it.

407
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:43,870
What?

408
00:29:44,370 --> 00:29:46,110
Don't try to hurt yourself.

409
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,310
Hurt myself?

410
00:29:51,810 --> 00:29:52,910
What a joke.

411
00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:56,920
I'm not like you who tries to kill himself.

412
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:59,050
Stop following me and go home.

413
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:01,490
I know you also tried to jump a few times.

414
00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:06,600
What?

415
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:08,500
You tried to die.

416
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:11,330
Did you ever see me try?

417
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,770
I scanned your memory.

418
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:22,710
You don't look like it, but you're really a jerk.

419
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:25,510
Go hit on the girls who go to the same school.

420
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:27,880
I know you were abused.

421
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:33,260
What?

422
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:35,260
You were saved right before you died and got adopted.

423
00:30:36,090 --> 00:30:39,090
And you're still suppressed by that memory.

424
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:42,800
Who told you that?

425
00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:06,220
Baek.

426
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:08,960
Baek. Baek.

427
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:10,830
Wake up.

428
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:14,560
- What's wrong? - Mr. Chun got into an accident.

429
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,530
What accident?

430
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:17,730
I don't know. We'll have to see.

431
00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:20,270
Are you going somewhere?

432
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:24,870
- I'll go with you. - So is this a joint investigation?

433
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:31,050
Okay. Let's go, Avengers.

434
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:52,830
(Chun K Soo)

435
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,250
Sir.

436
00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:17,160
What happened?

437
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:19,660
I can't remember anything because of my concussion.

438
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,630
What?

439
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:23,200
No matter how hard I try,

440
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:25,470
I can't remember his face.

441
00:32:26,130 --> 00:32:29,200
He's fast asleep. Training must've drained his energy.

442
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:32,510
Sure, I'll be there shortly.

443
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:36,310
Our son is in the car, so of course I'm driving safely.

444
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:38,510
What do you take me for?

445
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:43,890
Do you remember the fried chicken he likes?

446
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,750
You could order that.

447
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:47,690
Sure. See you soon.

448
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:50,660
Her and her nagging.

449
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:11,510
Joon Young,

450
00:33:12,210 --> 00:33:13,380
are you all right?

451
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:17,220
Joon Young, stay with me.

452
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:20,490
No, don't. Stay with me.

453
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:23,220
Joon Young!

454
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:26,290
Stay with me.

455
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:28,900
Son, stay with me!

456
00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:32,600
Joon Young, stay with me.

457
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:33,870
Joon Young!

458
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,040
Joon Young, no.

459
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:38,140
Joon Young!

460
00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:42,810
Help us. My son's in the backseat!

461
00:33:42,810 --> 00:33:45,110
Joon Young!

462
00:33:45,610 --> 00:33:47,720
Please help my son.

463
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:50,320
Joon Young!

464
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:53,050
Joon Young... No, get my son first.

465
00:33:53,050 --> 00:33:55,490
No, my son. Joon Young!

466
00:33:57,630 --> 00:33:59,130
No...

467
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:03,230
What are you doing? Someone's still in the car.

468
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:05,670
Someone's in the back seat.

469
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:08,440
My son's inside. Get him out!

470
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:10,310
Joon Young!

471
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:12,070
Joon Young, no.

472
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:14,140
Joon Young!

473
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:18,710
I can't remember...

474
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:20,520
his face though.

475
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:28,820
Scan my memory so that you can catch him.

476
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,150
Do you have a headache?

477
00:34:57,690 --> 00:35:00,220
No, it's nothing. I'm fine.

478
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:18,740
Joon Young, no.

479
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:20,440
Joon Young!

480
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:58,580
The Eraser!

481
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:01,250
The Eraser?

482
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:08,220
The murder who kills scumbags?

483
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:11,430
Why...

484
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:15,100
Why would he kill my son then?

485
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:17,700
He was a sweet boy.

486
00:36:19,330 --> 00:36:21,370
He couldn't even kill an insect.

487
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:26,270
I'll rip him to pieces.

488
00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:28,410
I'll kill him myself.

489
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:30,610
Hand it over.

490
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:36,850
That thing in your pocket.

491
00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:38,450
His pocket?

492
00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:53,840
What is this?

493
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:56,840
- His jacket button. - What are you doing?

494
00:37:02,010 --> 00:37:03,210
He ripped it off and swallowed it.

495
00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:05,380
Just find me any lead...

496
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:07,820
and I'll kill him myself.

497
00:37:10,490 --> 00:37:11,620
I see a shape.

498
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:13,390
A shape?

499
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:15,990
It looks like a flame.

500
00:37:24,370 --> 00:37:25,730
I think I know what it is.

501
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,140
What is this?

502
00:37:36,910 --> 00:37:38,680
It must be a torch at the center of the petals.

503
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:40,780
I see it now.

504
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:44,120
Talk to me.

505
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,420
Did you cross-check?

506
00:37:49,790 --> 00:37:51,330
Okay, good job.

507
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:54,500
The logo belongs to the fire department.

508
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:55,930
The fire department?

509
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:04,140
The torch at the center of a rose of Sharon borne by a bird.

510
00:38:04,270 --> 00:38:05,670
It's the core of the fire department's logo.

511
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:07,380
How on earth do you know all this?

512
00:38:07,610 --> 00:38:09,140
It's all thanks to the crime data center.

513
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:10,580
Does such a thing exist in Korea?

514
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:11,810
One is being established.

515
00:38:12,810 --> 00:38:14,750
We're in luck to get that kind of help.

516
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:16,150
I'm the one who's been establishing it.

517
00:38:17,290 --> 00:38:20,020
This is why we can't help but admire you, Ms. Han.

518
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:23,590
This is what you call the beauty of being clever.

519
00:38:23,830 --> 00:38:24,930
Which alphabets are on it?

520
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:27,060
S and B.

521
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:30,160
There are a total of eight units in the fire department...

522
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:32,530
with the initials S and B including district stations.

523
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:34,700
There's no need to narrow it down though.

524
00:38:34,970 --> 00:38:36,800
- It's that place. - That plce?

525
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,640
Where he first appeared. That's where he's been hiding.

526
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,380
- What? - What?

527
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:44,810
Let's see what's in store for us there.

528
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:46,450
What about Chun Ki Soo's other memories?

529
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:49,350
Was it really him who covered up the incident 20 years ago?

530
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:52,320
Why did the Eraser torch his son though?

531
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,120
- I don't know. - You don't know?

532
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:59,860
Did you only manage to see last night's events then?

533
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,260
Is something wrong with your head these days?

534
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:03,930
Should I contact the medical team?

535
00:39:03,930 --> 00:39:05,030
Mind your own business.

536
00:39:05,870 --> 00:39:07,270
But what if you pass out again?

537
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:09,740
Let him exhaust himself if that's what he wants.

538
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:12,840
Just know that everyone can die at any time.

539
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:16,610
Shouldn't we ask Mr. Chun about the case files again?

540
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:17,810
Have you become a psychopath?

541
00:39:17,810 --> 00:39:19,980
How can we question a man who just lost his only son?

542
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:21,480
But this case is more urgent.

543
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:23,220
We're off to find answers right now, aren't we?

544
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,920
I'm sure we'll find a lead of some sort.

545
00:39:27,090 --> 00:39:28,360
I can't believe you called me a psychopath.

546
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:49,140
(Shimbae Fire Station)

547
00:39:49,810 --> 00:39:50,810
Let's go.

548
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,450
(Shimbae Fire Station)

549
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:03,620
We have a special guest, so hurry up with the big welcome.

550
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:06,390
- Yes, sir. - I'm afraid we're in a hurry.

551
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:09,300
Things are urgent, so let us ask a few questions.

552
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:12,200
Could you take a look at this, please?

553
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:14,500
It's a button.

554
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,300
What kind of a button is it?

555
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,640
It's key evidence in a pressing case...

556
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:19,310
and the logo on it belongs to Shimbae Fire Station.

557
00:40:19,910 --> 00:40:21,940
- A case? - A murder case.

558
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:24,610
- Sorry? - This isn't one of ours.

559
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:28,020
It came off a sleeve, so maybe your full-dress uniform or...

560
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:29,450
Over there.

561
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,390
There aren't any buttons here.

562
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,690
- The ceremonial uniform. - The ceremonial uniform?

563
00:40:36,690 --> 00:40:38,530
It's on the uniform given to those...

564
00:40:38,530 --> 00:40:39,890
who served the department for 20 years.

565
00:40:40,290 --> 00:40:41,930
Yes, you're right.

566
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:57,010
Could we get a list of everyone who received the uniform?

567
00:40:57,350 --> 00:41:00,280
Everyone gets a set after 20 years.

568
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:01,920
Let us check your list of employees.

569
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:04,920
Sure.

570
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:09,560
Sir, how long have you worked here at Shimbae Fire Station?

571
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:11,830
About 30 years.

572
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:14,430
Do you remember the abandoned warehouse from 20 years ago...

573
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:16,200
where victims suffocated in?

574
00:41:16,730 --> 00:41:18,400
The one that took the lives of college students?

575
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:21,070
- So you know. - Of course. It was a big one.

576
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:23,170
Why didn't it make the headlines though?

577
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:27,640
I believe the bereaved families stopped it from being reported.

578
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:29,010
It would've made the news even more...

579
00:41:29,010 --> 00:41:30,550
considering how the victims came from wealthy families.

580
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,080
There was this rumor.

581
00:41:33,550 --> 00:41:34,550
A rumor?

582
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:38,190
Rumor had it that the kids did drugs.

583
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:39,820
Drugs?

584
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:41,320
Narcotics.

585
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:49,030
Is Detective Dong really here?

586
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:50,600
- Yes. - What for?

587
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,800
Remember the ceremonial uniform given to long-term firefighters?

588
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:57,200
The suit was found at a scene of a murder.

589
00:41:57,610 --> 00:41:59,340
What? Our uniform?

590
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,280
Didn't you receive it too?

591
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:04,150
I lost it. I took it in for dry-cleaning,

592
00:42:04,410 --> 00:42:06,050
but it got lost there.

593
00:42:06,610 --> 00:42:08,850
The deceased youngsters got high, lost their minds,

594
00:42:08,850 --> 00:42:10,690
and beat each other to death?

595
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:13,720
But the cause of death...

596
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:14,760
was reported as carbon monoxide poisoning.

597
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:18,030
They did die after breathing in the smoke from the campfire,

598
00:42:18,730 --> 00:42:21,300
but many say that was only because they were high.

599
00:42:22,130 --> 00:42:25,000
They got high and killed each other, but it was buried.

600
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:29,970
Here you go.

601
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:37,850
Including myself, 9 people were with the department for 20 years.

602
00:42:40,110 --> 00:42:43,080
(Yoon Soon Nam, M, Park Chang Won, M)

603
00:42:43,450 --> 00:42:45,090
There are six if you eliminate women.

604
00:42:45,490 --> 00:42:46,720
May we meet with them?

605
00:42:46,850 --> 00:42:49,060
Only three of them are here. The others are off today.

606
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:56,660
What is it?

607
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:58,100
Dong Baek's location was posted on social media.

608
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:00,600
He's at Shimbae Fire Department. We'll be there in five minutes.

609
00:43:01,070 --> 00:43:02,800
Don't you dare lose him.

610
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:04,040
We'll get him no matter what.

611
00:43:07,910 --> 00:43:09,010
Step on it.

612
00:43:11,050 --> 00:43:12,850
(Lee Shin Woong)

613
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:17,250
(Kim Do Soo - Intelligence Dept)

614
00:43:18,490 --> 00:43:20,620
- Hello? - Inspector Kim Do Soo...

615
00:43:20,620 --> 00:43:21,860
of Intelligence reporting in as ordered.

616
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:24,690
Detective Dong Baek is currently at Shimbae Fire Station.

617
00:43:25,330 --> 00:43:26,460
Shimbae Fire Station?

618
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:28,600
Yes, sir. The prosecutor is coming to arrest him.

619
00:43:31,270 --> 00:43:32,930
- Keep marking him. - Yes, sir.

620
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:38,510
Clear my schedule for the rest of the day.

621
00:43:38,710 --> 00:43:39,870
Yes, sir.

622
00:43:51,090 --> 00:43:54,260
Poisonous gas leak at a factory in Shimpan-dong.

623
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:56,360
Rescue One. Rescue One head out.

624
00:43:56,860 --> 00:43:57,930
Sorry.

625
00:43:58,360 --> 00:43:59,760
You'll have to wait.

626
00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:04,130
Do you not remember anything else from that incident?

627
00:44:04,470 --> 00:44:07,370
Not really. It was so long ago.

628
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,070
That's right.

629
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:14,140
Never mind. It's nothing.

630
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:15,880
Please tell us. Anything.

631
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:22,580
I heard that a police officer was already there...

632
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:24,420
before...

633
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:27,320
our fire fighters arrived.

634
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:30,860
And?

635
00:44:31,230 --> 00:44:33,430
He didn't do anything,

636
00:44:33,790 --> 00:44:35,800
and just fled by himself.

637
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:37,360
Why?

638
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:38,970
He probably didn't want to get involved.

639
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,440
Was it a police car from a precinct?

640
00:44:42,170 --> 00:44:43,540
I don't think so.

641
00:44:44,170 --> 00:44:46,810
- Who saw that officer? - What?

642
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:51,780
Well... So... I'm not sure.

643
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:54,180
Why?

644
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:55,880
Only the fire department was notified.

645
00:44:56,150 --> 00:44:57,890
The police weren't notified at all.

646
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:00,220
So it was only natural for the firefighters to arrive first.

647
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:03,720
Once the fire department is called, the police are called automatically.

648
00:45:03,990 --> 00:45:05,360
But it wasn't a patrol car.

649
00:45:06,030 --> 00:45:07,130
You're right.

650
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:09,130
The police could not have been faster than the fire department.

651
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:11,130
If he got there first...

652
00:45:11,570 --> 00:45:13,600
Was that cop...

653
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:15,800
the Eraser?

654
00:45:19,970 --> 00:45:22,440
If the Eraser is a cop, everything falls into place.

655
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:25,610
Was he able to erase all the records because he's a cop?

656
00:45:26,350 --> 00:45:27,550
You're right.

657
00:45:29,650 --> 00:45:30,790
The Eraser?

658
00:45:31,490 --> 00:45:32,550
Hold on.

659
00:45:33,890 --> 00:45:35,960
What about the button?

660
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:37,730
What?

661
00:45:37,730 --> 00:45:39,660
We're here because of the button from a firefighter's suit...

662
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:40,930
that the Eraser was wearing.

663
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:43,900
If the Eraser isn't a firefighter,

664
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:46,070
but the cop who was seen at the abandoned warehouse.

665
00:45:46,770 --> 00:45:50,540
Then who's the firefighter whose suit he was wearing?

666
00:45:50,770 --> 00:45:52,070
That Eraser jerk...

667
00:45:52,710 --> 00:45:55,180
stole a firefighter's suit and wore it intentionally. Why?

668
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:01,980
I don't understand what you're talking about.

669
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:04,850
Who was the person who saw that police officer?

670
00:46:05,550 --> 00:46:08,690
- Please forget I said anything... - This is very important.

671
00:46:11,090 --> 00:46:13,060
He was from a rescue team.

672
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,400
Noh Kwan Kyu, the rescue team captain?

673
00:46:17,870 --> 00:46:19,100
Captain Noh?

674
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:22,470
I just asked him, and...

675
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:23,940
I lost it.

676
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:26,740
I dropped it off at the cleaners, and they lost it.

677
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:28,680
He said he lost the suit.

678
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:31,350
Where is he now?

679
00:46:31,850 --> 00:46:33,080
He probably went to the scene.

680
00:46:34,110 --> 00:46:35,220
He's in danger.

681
00:46:35,550 --> 00:46:36,850
The suit the Eraser wore...

682
00:46:39,250 --> 00:46:40,350
was bait.

683
00:46:41,090 --> 00:46:42,190
The next murder victim.

684
00:46:42,290 --> 00:46:44,690
Order Captain Noh to return immediately.

685
00:46:45,830 --> 00:46:48,630
- What do you mean? - I don't know,

686
00:46:48,730 --> 00:46:52,030
but the detectives say you're in danger and to return immediately.

687
00:46:52,170 --> 00:46:54,170
What stupid nonsense is that?

688
00:46:54,170 --> 00:46:55,600
If they need to talk to me, tell them to come here.

689
00:46:56,970 --> 00:47:00,170
Okay. You will be forgiven if you fail to rescue victims,

690
00:47:00,170 --> 00:47:02,180
but you will not be forgiven if you get hurt. Got it?

691
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:03,580
- Yes, sir! - Yes, sir!

692
00:47:04,110 --> 00:47:06,280
His life is in danger!

693
00:47:06,710 --> 00:47:09,150
He never leaves the scene first.

694
00:47:10,180 --> 00:47:11,250
We'll go to him.

695
00:47:17,730 --> 00:47:20,490
Chun Ki Soo led the investigation of the Shimbae warehouse case...

696
00:47:20,490 --> 00:47:21,860
in which the Eraser killed 7 people 20 years ago.

697
00:47:21,860 --> 00:47:22,860
That's right.

698
00:47:22,860 --> 00:47:24,930
When he burned Chun Ki Soo's son to death,

699
00:47:25,170 --> 00:47:27,840
the Eraser stole and wore what was probably Noh Kwan Kyu's suit.

700
00:47:27,940 --> 00:47:29,640
- Then that was... - He was announcing his next murder.

701
00:47:30,270 --> 00:47:32,240
That he'll kill the owner of the suit?

702
00:47:32,610 --> 00:47:33,840
Eliminating a witness.

703
00:47:35,340 --> 00:47:37,310
Captain Noh Kwan Kyu saw an unidentified police officer...

704
00:47:37,310 --> 00:47:39,280
during the abandoned warehouse incident.

705
00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:43,050
The real Eraser, who had arrived before he did.

706
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:45,850
So he's trying to get rid of him because he's a witness.

707
00:47:46,150 --> 00:47:48,390
We need to find him and read his memory...

708
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:50,620
Freeze!

709
00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:52,830
Baek, go ahead. Let's use our bodies to stop them.

710
00:47:52,830 --> 00:47:53,990
We'll sacrifice our bodies.

711
00:47:53,990 --> 00:47:55,100
See you soon.

712
00:47:56,330 --> 00:47:59,170
Hey, you! Stop right there!

713
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:01,870
Stop, you jerk!

714
00:48:24,510 --> 00:48:26,210
Stop the search. Let's pull out.

715
00:48:26,210 --> 00:48:27,910
Victim needing rescue on the second floor, north side.

716
00:48:27,910 --> 00:48:30,010
The second floor, north side. A victim requested a rescue.

717
00:48:30,510 --> 00:48:31,910
This is the captain. I'm on the second floor.

718
00:48:32,150 --> 00:48:33,850
- I'll go myself. - Copy that.

719
00:48:47,630 --> 00:48:48,760
Help me.

720
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:51,030
Help me.

721
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:00,910
Are you okay?

722
00:50:45,580 --> 00:50:46,680
Captain.

723
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:48,780
Captain!

724
00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:51,290
Darn it. I'm going back in.

725
00:50:51,290 --> 00:50:52,450
Give me a new oxygen tank!

726
00:50:54,590 --> 00:50:55,660
There he is!

727
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:06,530
Captain.

728
00:51:11,970 --> 00:51:13,870
- Remove his belt. - Captain.

729
00:51:14,170 --> 00:51:15,240
Captain.

730
00:51:16,580 --> 00:51:18,080
Giving him mouth-to-mouth now.

731
00:51:20,380 --> 00:51:22,480
Captain! Sir!

732
00:51:27,690 --> 00:51:28,890
Baek.

733
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:30,690
Baek, are you okay?

734
00:51:30,690 --> 00:51:32,330
You lunatic! Why did you go in there?

735
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:34,160
He's... He's there.

736
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:36,400
- What? - He's... He's still nearby.

737
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:38,870
Hurry. Hurry!

738
00:51:42,070 --> 00:51:43,140
What are you trying to do?

739
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:45,870
His memory from 20 years ago.

740
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:52,410
- Hurry! - Let's go!

741
00:51:52,410 --> 00:51:53,680
Let's get going!

742
00:51:54,350 --> 00:51:55,920
No, wait!

743
00:51:56,450 --> 00:51:57,580
Be careful.

744
00:51:58,990 --> 00:52:01,790
No, wait. Wait.

745
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:03,620
- Wait. - Watch out.

746
00:52:05,230 --> 00:52:06,660
Wait. No.

747
00:52:07,060 --> 00:52:08,600
Detective Dong?

748
00:52:08,630 --> 00:52:10,560
We're the police. This is an emergency.

749
00:52:34,660 --> 00:52:36,890
His vitals are back to normal.

750
00:52:46,670 --> 00:52:48,040
Detective Dong, you're not well.

751
00:52:49,770 --> 00:52:50,840
Just forget it!

752
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:06,020
(20 years ago, April, 2000)

753
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:18,730
Are you okay?

754
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:23,070
Hey!

755
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:26,110
Hey, are you okay?

756
00:53:38,750 --> 00:53:40,350
Can you please call for backup?

757
00:53:46,190 --> 00:53:47,260
Hello?

758
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:13,550
(Shim Sang Ah)

759
00:54:16,290 --> 00:54:17,290
The Eraser.

760
00:54:18,690 --> 00:54:21,930
He has a big scar on his right arm.

761
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:24,330
His right arm? Did you see his face?

762
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:25,630
No.

763
00:54:25,830 --> 00:54:28,800
He was wearing a mask, so I couldn't see his face.

764
00:54:33,010 --> 00:54:34,110
Your nose is bleeding.

765
00:54:35,710 --> 00:54:38,250
He has a big... A big scar.

766
00:54:43,950 --> 00:54:46,550
Detective Dong! Detective Dong!

767
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:53,630
Stay still.

768
00:54:56,830 --> 00:54:57,830
Who do you think you are?

769
00:55:05,470 --> 00:55:07,610
What? What's your problem?

770
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:48,480
Honey, put the laundry in the washing machine.

771
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:05,970
Detective Dong!

772
00:57:15,740 --> 00:57:18,840
(Memorist)

773
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:26,850
(Epilogue)

774
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:32,320
Kim Yong Jin.

775
00:57:32,850 --> 00:57:33,990
Jo Yeon Gyeong.

776
00:57:34,690 --> 00:57:35,860
Lee Ho Rim.

777
00:57:36,860 --> 00:57:38,090
Park Seung Hwan.

778
00:57:39,090 --> 00:57:40,260
Lee Jun.

779
00:57:40,990 --> 00:57:42,160
Lee Su Hyeon.

780
00:57:43,430 --> 00:57:44,530
Park Hwan Uk.

781
00:57:45,070 --> 00:57:46,270
Yoo Chang Hoon.

782
00:57:46,770 --> 00:57:48,030
Kim Sang Soo.

783
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:50,440
Oh Gyeong Hoon.

784
00:57:51,140 --> 00:57:52,310
Jo In Hye.

785
00:57:52,970 --> 00:57:54,210
Jang Seok Chan.

786
00:57:55,810 --> 00:57:58,250
Lee Geon Woo. Park Seong Min.

787
00:57:59,110 --> 00:58:00,510
Lee Sang Hoon.

788
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:02,180
Kim Tae Hyeon.

789
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:04,320
Lee Jun Woo.

790
00:58:06,690 --> 00:58:08,260
These 17 people...

791
00:58:09,190 --> 00:58:11,090
died because of you, Dad.

792
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:15,500
They died because of us.

793
00:58:18,430 --> 00:58:20,400
Dad, I know you can't say anything.

794
00:58:22,570 --> 00:58:24,600
And I know you guys can't hear this.

795
00:58:33,150 --> 00:58:34,880
But I'm still very sorry.

796
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:41,090
He loved justifying his murders, but that's not how he kills anymore.

797
00:58:41,220 --> 00:58:44,320
- The innocent will be crucified. - On behalf of the sinner.

798
00:58:44,490 --> 00:58:46,330
His purpose was to murder people.

799
00:58:46,330 --> 00:58:47,830
Chun Ki Soo is the connection.

800
00:58:47,930 --> 00:58:49,000
Who are you?

801
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:52,070
Your savior. The person who can save your son.

802
00:58:52,170 --> 00:58:54,370
- Chun Ki Soo disappeared. - There isn't a single trace.

803
00:58:54,530 --> 00:58:57,300
He was after the Eraser.

804
00:58:57,300 --> 00:58:59,610
- What? - I saw the scar on his right arm.

805
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:01,780
- Who was that? - You were the Eraser.

806
00:59:02,110 --> 00:59:04,580
You were at Shimbae City 20 years ago!
