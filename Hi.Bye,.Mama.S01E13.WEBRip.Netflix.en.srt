<b>Do you know what time it is?
Come on, get up.</b>

3

<b>-No...
-Hey, you're already late! Come on.</b>

4
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:57,910
<b>Hurry. Hey!</b>

5
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,830
<b>Hey! The soup's spilling...</b>

6
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:02,630
<b>Goodnight...</b>

7
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:05,300
<b>-"Goodnight"? Come on, get up.
-Just a bit more...</b>

8
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:18,730
<b>That's so funny. Oh, my gosh.</b>

9
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:22,440
<b>I'd prefer a woman
who's cold to every guy.</b>

10
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,020
<b>I'd prefer a guy who's always kind.</b>

11
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:25,320
<b>WHICH GUY WOULD YOU MARRY?</b>

12
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,440
<b>A woman who's kind to every man?</b>

13
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,030
<b>-I'd--
-Then would you...</b>

14
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,160
<b>All right.</b>

15
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:39,540
<b>My goodness.</b>

16
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:42,500
<b>Hey, what is this?</b>

17
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:45,340
<b>Should I tell you why sales are so low?</b>

18
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:51,260
<b>The time that had been flowing with us</b>

19
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:55,100
<b>suddenly stopped one day.</b>

20
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:55,780
<b>I...</b>

21
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,030
<b>What? I'm doing my best.</b>

22
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,580
<b>-It's too salty.
-Oh, really?</b>

23
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:26,310
<b>Don't cry.</b>

24
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:32,820
<b>Don't cry.</b>

25
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:34,950
<b>Don't cry.</b>

26
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:41,830
<b>Time stopped for the person I love

27
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:44,580
<b>I prayed that

28
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:55,130
<b>-Hey, Gang-hwa.
-Bye.</b>

<b>Date that nurse, Oh Min-jeong.</b>

<b>Think about it the other way around.</b>

31
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,770
<b>What if it happened to you,
and you left Yu-ri all alone?</b>

32
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:08,100
<b>Would you like it if Yu-ri lives her life</b>

33
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:11,610
<b>suppressing her feelings

34

<b>Aren't you Yu-ri's friend?</b>

35
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:19,740
<b>I am.</b>

36
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:23,830
<b>I'll always be on her side, and I'll
always think from her point of view.</b>

37
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:26,330
<b>That's why I'm saying this.</b>

38
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:48,690
<b>You idiot. You loser.</b>

<b>During the time I couldn't see her,</b>

49

<b>what would she have thought?</b>

50
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,010
<b>You fool.</b>

00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:14,830
<b>Why didn't you tell me earlier?</b>

78
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:17,660
<b>I found out only recently.</b>

79
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:18,870

85
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:49,110
<b>Knew what?</b>

86
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,240
<b>That Yu-ri was by my side</b>

87

<b>for the past five years.</b>

<b>How did you find out?</b>

89
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:02,000
<b>Gang-hwa...</b>

90
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:16,470
<b>She said she couldn't remember.</b>

91

<b>She said she just woke up at a cinerarium.</b>

92

<b>What do we do about Gang-hwa?</b>

93
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:23,730
<b>That's why she couldn't tell him.</b>

94
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:24,690
<b>What?</b>

95
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,480
<b>After Yu-ri died,</b>

96
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:30,440
<b>Gang-hwa really had a tough time.</b>

97
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:31,990
<b>He blamed himself.</b>

98
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:36,910
<b>Right. He was just living
because he couldn't die.</b>

99
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:40,250
<b>Thinking of that just makes me...</b>

100
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:42,080
<b>But Yu-ri saw all of that.</b>

101
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:45,290
<b>That's why she couldn't tell him.</b>

102
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:49,590
<b>Because Gang-hwa
would blame himself again.</b>

<b>Hyeon-jeong.</b>

104

<b>I feel so bad for Yu-ri. What do we do?</b>

105
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:03,850
<b>Min-jeong.</b>

106
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:09,150
<b>Hello.</b>

107
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:12,860
<b>Did you happen to see
Seo-woo and Gang-hwa?</b>

108
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,570
<b>Mom!</b>

109
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:18,740
<b>Seo-woo, what are you doing here?
Where's your dad?</b>

110
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:23,080
<b>-Did Gang-hwa go somewhere?
-He went somewhere.</b>

111
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,870
<b>-What?
-Well, he went</b>

112
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,580
<b>there.</b>

113
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:27,960
<b>Somewhere.</b>

114
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,500
<b>Where did he go? You know, right?</b>

115
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:33,010
<b>-He went to the hospital.
-Yes, the hospital.</b>

116
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:34,260
<b>He went to the hospital.</b>

117
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:36,840
<b>He got an urgent call from the hospital.</b>

118
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:39,350
<b>And I have dementia,</b>

119
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:42,470
<b>so I keep forgetting stuff.</b>

120
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,980
<b>-Pardon?
-What?</b>

121
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:47,900
<b>The dads were planning on
spending time with the kids,</b>

122
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,820
<b>but Ha-jun wouldn't let go of me,
so the three of them played together.</b>

123
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:55,320
<b>So that's why you were with Ha-jun.</b>

124
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:58,240
<b>-Why didn't you say so?
-Sorry.</b>

125
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:03,330
<b>Well, Gang-hwa and I had fun
with Seo-woo today,</b>

126
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,540
<b>but he just got an urgent call</b>

127
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:07,870
<b>so he left Seo-woo with us
and left in a hurry.</b>

128
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:12,840
<b>I couldn't get in touch with Gang-hwa,
so I came here just in case.</b>

129
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:15,970
<b>It was an urgent call,
so he probably can't answer his phone.</b>

130
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,430
<b>Why</b>

131
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:29,440
<b>didn't you tell me sooner?</b>

132
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,110
<b>What's the point of telling you?</b>

133
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:37,070
<b>It would only hurt the both of us.</b>

134
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:45,080
<b>Weren't you hurt</b>

135
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:48,500
<b>when you saw me</b>

136
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,090
<b>living a happy life without you?</b>

137
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:57,550
<b>Were you okay with that?</b>

138
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:01,800
<b>It hurt.</b>

139
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:03,310
<b>A lot.</b>

140
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:11,100
<b>Someone else was seeing the smile
you used to make only at me.</b>

141
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:15,030
<b>And someone else was holding
the hand that only I used to hold.</b>

142
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:20,610
<b>And someone else was in the place
I was supposed to be at.</b>

143
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:23,530
<b>It hurt.</b>

144
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:29,500
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

145
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:32,880
<b>I'm really sorry.</b>

146
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:35,800
<b>But it hurt</b>

147
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:38,720
<b>millions of times more</b>

148
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,470
<b>seeing you cry alone.</b>

149
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:51,940
<b>You woke up alone,</b>

150
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,650
<b>watched Seo-woo alone,</b>

151
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:57,230
<b>and ate alone</b>

152
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:59,360
<b>in an empty house without me.</b>

153
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:03,110
<b>And you</b>

154
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:05,450
<b>cried alone.</b>

155
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:09,750
<b>That hurt so much</b>

156
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,330
<b>that I didn't even get jealous
of the other person.</b>

157
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,340
<b>It broke my heart,</b>

158
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:18,960
<b>but I felt so relieved.</b>

159
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:23,470
<b>I should've</b>

160
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,640
<b>endured all that.</b>

161
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:33,600
<b>It was something I should've endured</b>

162
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:37,900
<b>even if it was agonizing.</b>

163
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:43,280
<b>You felt enough pain,</b>

164
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:46,450
<b>and you endured enough.</b>

165
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:50,290
<b>I can hardly breathe.</b>

166
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,080
<b>Why did you do this to me?</b>

167
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:57,840
<b>Bring her back. Bring her back, you jerk.</b>

168
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:08,470
<b>I only wanted one thing back then.</b>

169
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:17,230
<b>I wanted you to put me behind you
and go on with your life.</b>

170
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,360
<b>So don't blame yourself.</b>

171
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:11,660
<b>You really love Min-jeong.</b>

172
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:18,630
<b>I know you do.</b>

173
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:21,340
<b>Even if no one in the world can tell,</b>

174
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:23,050
<b>I know it.</b>

175
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:30,550
<b>Gang-hwa.</b>

176
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:41,060
<b>I'm not yours anymore.</b>

177
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:47,900
<b>You can let me go now.</b>

178
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:08,430
<b>I wonder why Gang-hwa came at this hour.</b>

179
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:12,680
<b>I don't know.</b>

180
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:15,930
<b>Yu-ri coming back to life</b>

181
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:19,690
<b>is a huge blessing for us.</b>

182
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:23,440
<b>But it might not be the case
for Gang-hwa and his wife.</b>

183
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:27,150
<b>I feel sorry for Gang-hwa's wife.</b>

184
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:33,910
<b>You don't need to feel sorry.</b>

185
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:39,460
<b>We're not asking for her place
as Seo-woo's mom or Gang-hwa's wife.</b>

186
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:45,130
<b>We're just grateful
that Yu-ri came back to us.</b>

187
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:48,300
<b>I know,</b>

188
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:53,800
<b>but if I knew this was going to happen,</b>

189
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:58,350
<b>I should've opposed when Gang-hwa
came to us asking permission</b>

190
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,520
<b>for him to remarry.</b>

191
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:03,400
<b>No.</b>

192
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:08,490
<b>Even if I go back to that day,
I would still tell him to remarry.</b>

193
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:12,070
<b>I can't see him suffering like that again.</b>

194
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:25,290
<b>Is that why you ran away
when you first saw me?</b>

195
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:28,590
<b>You never wanted</b>

196
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,130
<b>to appear in front of me?</b>

197
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,810
<b>Seo-woo's freezer incident
happened because of me.</b>

198
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:41,350
<b>How could I do that to you?</b>

199
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:45,060
<b>The freezer incident?</b>

200
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:47,900
<b>Why is that</b>

201
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:50,280
<b>your fault?</b>

202
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:57,780
<b>Didn't you hear from Hyeon-jeong?</b>

203
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:05,170
<b>Then who did you hear that from?</b>

204
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:09,340
<b>A man who said he was your friend.
He was wearing black clothes...</b>

205
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:15,720
<b>-Who are you?
-I'm here for your daughter.</b>

206
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:17,100
<b>Why?</b>

207
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,430
<b>Who is he?</b>

208
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:22,350
<b>Did he approach you and Seo-woo?</b>

209
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:23,770
<b>Yes.</b>

210
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:27,060
<b>Where's Seo-woo? Where is she right now?</b>

211
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,400
<b>At Hyeon-jeong's. Misaeng.</b>

212
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:33,070
<b>Yu-ri.</b>

213
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:35,450
<b>What is it? What's going on?</b>

214
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:43,830
<b>Seo-woo</b>

215
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,460
<b>can see ghosts.</b>

216
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:50,300
<b>What?</b>

217
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:57,010
<b>That freezer incident</b>

218
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,390
<b>happened because she followed a ghost.</b>

219
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,400
<b>What do you mean, Yu-ri?</b>

220
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,610
<b>What...</b>

221
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:14,320
<b>Why would Seo-woo see ghosts?</b>

222
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:18,530
<b>I was always by her side</b>

223
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:22,290
<b>since she was born.</b>

224
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,250
<b>That's why she can see ghosts.</b>

225
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:35,590
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

226
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:43,060
<b>I'm so sorry.</b>

227
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:47,140
<b>It's all my fault. I'm really sorry.</b>

228
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:53,320
<b>Seo-woo has been watching me.</b>

229
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:55,780
<b>That's why...</b>

230
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:58,990
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

231
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:01,780
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

232
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:21,260
<b>Good.</b>

233
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:35,820
<b>Gang-hwa?</b>

234
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:40,950
<b>What are you doing here?</b>

235
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:43,240
<b>I couldn't reach you,
so I came to find you.</b>

236
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:46,240
<b>Why do you look so dazed?</b>

237
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:48,830
<b>Well...</b>

238
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,080
<b>It's nothing.</b>

239
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:52,880
<b>It's nothing.</b>

240
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,630
<b>There's something going on, right?</b>

241
00:21:57,210 --> 00:21:58,050
<b>What?</b>

242
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:05,560
<b>No,</b>

243
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,520
<b>I'm fine.</b>

244
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:15,270
<b>You should've brought her home
if you were going to the hospital.</b>

245
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:25,580
<b>Seo-woo, come here.</b>

246
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:54,150
<b>I'm really sorry.</b>

247
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:55,730
<b>I'm really sorry.</b>

248
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:58,690
<b>I'm sorry. It's my fault.</b>

249
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,200
<b>Yu-ri.</b>

250
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:15,630
<b>It's not your fault.</b>

251
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:19,130
<b>It's okay.</b>

252
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:22,630
<b>It's okay, Yu-ri.</b>

253
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,810
<b>Did Yu-ri go out again?</b>

254
00:24:56,890 --> 00:24:59,520
<b>Yes. Are you going to pray again?</b>

255
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:01,650
<b>I should.</b>

256
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:05,280
<b>Mom. It seemed like
Yu-ri cried all night...</b>

257
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,490
<b>It's fine, you don't need to tell me.
I know.</b>

258
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:13,910
<b>I'm going.</b>

259
00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:15,330
<b>Okay.</b>

260
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,620
<b>Be careful.</b>

261
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,050
<b>What is it?</b>

262
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:33,260
<b>Who's visiting so early in the morning?</b>

263
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,280
<b>My gosh. Who is it?</b>

264
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:50,610
<b>It's you. What is it?</b>

265
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:52,280
<b>-Where's that exorcist?
-What?</b>

266
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:56,490
<b>Where is that exorcist jerk?
I'm going to kill him! Is he in here?</b>

267
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:58,040
<b>-No.
-Come out!</b>

268
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:00,210
<b>What's gotten into you?</b>

269
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,670
<b>Wait, did he actually find your daughter?</b>

270
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:08,380
<b>Oh, my goodness. He's begun now.</b>

271
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:11,260
<b>Come on, why don't you calm down first?</b>

272
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:13,220
<b>How can I calm down right now?</b>

273
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:14,720
<b>A shaman?</b>

274
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:17,060
<b>How can you do that to a six-year-old?</b>

275
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:18,430
<b>All right, just come inside.</b>

276
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:21,810
<b>-Come inside.
-Did the deities order this, too?</b>

277
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:23,400
<b>-My gosh.
-Did they order this?</b>

278
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:27,400
<b>-Did you hear that?
-Yes.</b>

279
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:29,900
<b>The exorcist must be after
Yu-ri's daughter.</b>

280
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:33,740
<b>He's such a cold monster.</b>

281
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:36,450
<b>So make sure to avoid him at all costs.</b>

282
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:37,700
<b>One mistake,</b>

283
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:40,580
<b>and we'd get sent up before
we get to see Pil-seung get married.</b>

284
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:42,750
<b>No way. No.</b>

285
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:45,290
<b>-That can't ever happen.
-Let's go.</b>

286
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,170
<b>Yes, let's go.</b>

287
00:26:52,930 --> 00:26:55,220
<b>Are you just going to stand there
huffing like that?</b>

288
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,010
<b>What choice do I have?</b>

289
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,600
<b>There's nothing I can do right now.</b>

290
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,600
<b>What?</b>

291
00:27:02,810 --> 00:27:04,100
<b>What should I do?</b>

292
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:07,110
<b>I was thinking of going up
when Seo-woo became normal.</b>

293
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,070
<b>But she can still see them,</b>

294
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:10,990
<b>and now there's a weird exorcist
after her.</b>

295
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:13,990
<b>But there's nothing I can do.</b>

296
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:19,200
<b>There is something you can do.</b>

297
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:21,200
<b>Like what?</b>

298
00:27:21,290 --> 00:27:24,170
<b>Your daughter can stop seeing ghosts.</b>

299
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:25,750
<b>Don't worry.</b>

300
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:27,590
<b>You can trust me on that.</b>

301
00:27:29,050 --> 00:27:31,300
<b>-Are you sure?
-Yes, I'm sure of it.</b>

302
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:35,090
<b>So you should focus on your job
and what you want to do.</b>

303
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,180
<b>What do you mean?</b>

304
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:40,640
<b>You're going to leave soon.
There are only a few days left.</b>

305
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,230
<b>Will you just waste your time
and leave this world?</b>

306
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:45,730
<b>Is there anything you want to do?</b>

307
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:11,340
<b>Whatever the reason may be,
this is a rare chance.</b>

308
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:14,840
<b>You don't have enough time to do
everything you want.</b>

309
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:18,760
<b>Since you made up your mind
to leave this world,</b>

310
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:20,680
<b>do everything you want to do
before you go.</b>

311
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:22,310
<b>But that exorcist keeps--</b>

312
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:25,850
<b>Goodness, didn't I tell you?
I told you Guk-bong would be back again.</b>

313
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,940
<b>But why does he keep showing up?</b>

314
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:30,190
<b>To confirm
that your daughter can see ghosts.</b>

315
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:32,650
<b>And once he confirms it,
we can't undo this.</b>

316
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:35,530
<b>There are fewer people
who can see ghosts these days,</b>

317
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:37,450
<b>so he's not going to lose even one.</b>

318
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:40,320
<b>But you're completely against it.</b>

319
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:41,870
<b>You bet I am.</b>

320
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:42,910
<b>Exactly.</b>

321
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,620
<b>Just focus on protecting your daughter</b>

322
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:46,460
<b>and hang in there
for the remaining time here.</b>

323
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:48,330
<b>Enjoy your time here until you go.</b>

324
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,330
<b>What happens once I leave here?</b>

325
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:51,880
<b>What will happen to Seo-woo?</b>

326
00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:53,710
<b>Don't worry.</b>

327
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:55,760
<b>Your daughter can stop seeing ghosts.</b>

328
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:57,380
<b>Just trust me.</b>

329
00:28:59,890 --> 00:29:00,970
<b>Yu-ri.</b>

330
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:04,270
<b>Mom.</b>

331
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:05,810
<b>Why are you here?</b>

332
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:08,270
<b>I...</b>

333
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:12,150
<b>She's not crying.
She's just roaming around everywhere.</b>

334
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:17,110
<b>Roaming around?
My daughter? In this world?</b>

335
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:19,320
<b>No, I didn't mean it. It's...</b>

336
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:25,120
<b>Mom, are you here to pray?</b>

337
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:27,620
<b>Yes.</b>

338
00:29:28,290 --> 00:29:29,460
<b>Why are you here?</b>

339
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:32,590
<b>I just had to take care of something.</b>

340
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:34,170
<b>Let's go, Mom.</b>

341
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:36,090
<b>I was just about to leave, too.</b>

342
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:37,800
<b>Okay.</b>

343
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:48,270
<b>I feel like a sinner
because I slipped just once.</b>

344
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,900
<b>Once she leaves,</b>

345
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,030
<b>how is her mom going to deal with that?</b>

346
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:01,110
<b>Your friend? That shaman is your friend?</b>

347
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,240
<b>Yes.</b>

348
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:08,580
<b>She looks way older than you.
How is she your friend?</b>

349
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:11,370
<b>Age doesn't matter in friendship.</b>

350
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:13,460
<b>She's nice despite her looks.</b>

351
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:17,380
<b>Did you really come here to meet her?</b>

352
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:19,260
<b>Yes.</b>

353
00:30:20,170 --> 00:30:21,720
<b>Mom, what about you?</b>

354
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:26,600
<b>Why do you think?
I came here to offer my prayer.</b>

355
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:30,390
<b>I thanked him
for sending back my daughter.</b>

356
00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:34,690
<b>What if he takes you away because
I stop coming to pay my respect?</b>

357
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,160
<b>Mom,</b>

358
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:47,660
<b>is there anything you want to do with me?</b>

359
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:48,950
<b>With you?</b>

360
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,960
<b>Things you regret not doing with me.</b>

361
00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:55,880
<b>I am</b>

362
00:30:57,170 --> 00:31:01,630
<b>just happy to be with you.
I don't want anything else.</b>

363
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:17,480
<b>You already got her ready?</b>

364
00:31:17,570 --> 00:31:19,780
<b>Yes. I'll drop her off
at the kindergarten.</b>

365
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:23,780
<b>Gang-hwa, what's gotten into you
yesterday and today?</b>

366
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:25,820
<b>What? What do you mean?</b>

367
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:27,910
<b>You're practically glued to her.
You won't leave her.</b>

368
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:41,090
<b>-Where are you going?
-To pee.</b>

369
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,170
<b>To pee? Let's go.</b>

370
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:50,180
<b>Seo-woo, where are you going?</b>

371
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:11,290
<b>You've been following her
around the whole day.</b>

372
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:14,160
<b>-Really?
-Yes.</b>

373
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:23,130
<b>Right. We talked about Seo-woo's
pick-up helper yesterday.</b>

374
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:25,220
<b>What?</b>

375
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:27,220
<b>-Min-jeong.
-Yes?</b>

376
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:30,350
<b>Let's</b>

377
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:35,390
<b>get a new pick-up helper.</b>

378
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:39,020
<b>Tell me why you want a new pick-up helper.</b>

379
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:45,610
<b>If you don't tell me, I won't do it.</b>

380
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,540
<b>There's a room
somewhere in Gang-hwa's heart.</b>

381
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:57,620
<b>It's a room I should never open up</b>

382
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:01,420
<b>even if everyone
in the world opens up to look at it.</b>

383
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,210
<b>And that was really tough.</b>

384
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:36,120
<b>You don't have to tell me now,</b>

385
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:40,000
<b>but tell me when you are ready to tell me.</b>

386
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:44,880
<b>Can you come to the hospital
later in the afternoon today?</b>

387
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:53,430
<b>I'll tell you everything
why we need a new helper.</b>

388
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:00,440
<b>You're going to leave soon.</b>

389
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:02,440
<b>There are only a few days left.</b>

390
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:04,650
<b>Will you just waste your time
and leave this world?</b>

391
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:06,150
<b>Is there anything you want to do?</b>

392
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:13,910
<b>What was that?</b>

393
00:34:13,990 --> 00:34:16,620
<b>Hey, you know that dumb friend of yours?</b>

394
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:19,290
<b>What's his name? Bin or Bong?
Anyway, he's following your friend.</b>

395
00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:20,460
<b>My dumb friend?</b>

396
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:21,710
<b>Geun-sang?</b>

397
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:28,300
<b>Yu-ri.</b>

398
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:30,840
<b>Are you okay?</b>

399
00:34:32,130 --> 00:34:35,260
<b>I heard everything.
How did you go through all that?</b>

400
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:38,350
<b>It's all right.</b>

401
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:41,890
<b>Everything will be okay now.</b>

402
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:46,610
<b>-Geun-sang.
-Tell me.</b>

403
00:34:47,650 --> 00:34:49,440
<b>Tell me everything. I'm all ears.</b>

404
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:53,070
<b>What have you been up to?
Why is a ghost following you?</b>

405
00:34:54,870 --> 00:34:55,820
<b>What are you saying?</b>

406
00:34:56,490 --> 00:34:57,910
<b>Don't make jokes about that.</b>

407
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:00,000
<b>And you of all people shouldn't.</b>

408
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,370
<b>What's wrong with you?</b>

409
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:03,870
<b>No, that's not true.</b>

410
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:07,040
<b>Why are you making things creepy
this morning?</b>

411
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:09,090
<b>Where? Where is it?</b>

412
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:11,220
<b>-Goodness.
-Where?</b>

413
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:15,390
<b>Yu-ri. Where are you going? Don't go!</b>

414
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:17,350
<b>Tell me about it before you go!</b>

415
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:22,230
<b>I'm scared. I'm...</b>

416
00:35:23,770 --> 00:35:26,270
<b>You give me peace like a river</b>

417
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:29,270
<b>You give me peace like a river</b>

418
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,110
<b>Hallelujah</b>

419
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:34,150
<b>You give me peace like a river</b>

420
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,280
<b>You give me peace like a river</b>

421
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:52,420
<b>-Hello.
-Hello.</b>

422
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:59,810
<b>I'm right about this.
It's all over the town.</b>

423
00:36:00,350 --> 00:36:02,810
<b>Those two were crying like crazy
at the playground.</b>

424
00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:05,730
<b>Are you sure it was Seo-woo's dad
and the kitchen assistant?</b>

425
00:36:05,810 --> 00:36:07,560
<b>-Yes.
-She said they were.</b>

426
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:11,610
<b>But she has no idea.
They are hanging out like besties. Gosh.</b>

427
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,570
<b>Hi, you're here.</b>

428
00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:18,320
<b>Hello, Seo-woo.</b>

429
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:20,950
<b>-All right. Take off your shoes.
-Take off your shoes.</b>

430
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:25,830
<b>Let's take off your shoes and go inside.
Let's go.</b>

431
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:28,670
<b>Say bye to your dad.</b>

432
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:29,790
<b>Seo-woo.</b>

433
00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:35,340
<b>-Oh, right.
-Okay.</b>

434
00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:37,300
<b>Bye.</b>

435
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:38,760
<b>Let's go.</b>

436
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,960
<b>He's not okay at all.</b>

437
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:21,090
<b>Are you okay?</b>

438
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:24,680
<b>I mean, she should</b>

439
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:27,730
<b>have told you
she watched you for five years.</b>

440
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:31,560
<b>No. How could she tell you that? Goodness.</b>

441
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:34,980
<b>Have you ever felt this?</b>

442
00:37:35,610 --> 00:37:36,820
<b>You did something awful</b>

443
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:39,320
<b>that you didn't want this person</b>

444
00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:41,110
<b>to find out.</b>

445
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:42,700
<b>But it turned out that</b>

446
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:46,540
<b>this person
had been watching the whole time.</b>

447
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:48,330
<b>That's how it feels.</b>

448
00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:49,540
<b>I know.</b>

449
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:51,580
<b>It feels naked.</b>

450
00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:56,130
<b>Hey, but what you did wasn't awful.</b>

451
00:37:56,210 --> 00:37:59,010
<b>Is remarrying a bad thing?
Why is that awful?</b>

452
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,340
<b>She saw everything.</b>

453
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:03,890
<b>Did you know that she was?</b>

454
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:05,760
<b>Did you know
she'd stay with you as a ghost?</b>

455
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:07,390
<b>Did you know she'd come back?</b>

456
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:08,770
<b>Don't blame yourself.</b>

457
00:38:08,850 --> 00:38:10,940
<b>Yu-ri said this is why
she didn't tell you.</b>

458
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,730
<b>Gang-hwa, Doctor Jang is looking for you.</b>

459
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:27,790
<b>Observe my surgery starting this week.</b>

460
00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:28,790
<b>Pardon?</b>

461
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:33,670
<b>When I do my surgery,
come into the operating room</b>

462
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:34,880
<b>and watch.</b>

463
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:39,720
<b>I think we did enough for counseling.</b>

464
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:42,470
<b>We should get you exposed
to the surroundings to overcome this.</b>

465
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:45,800
<b>I'm not confident
that I can handle the exposure.</b>

466
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:47,140
<b>Bye.</b>

467
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:48,720
<b>-Hey. You.
-Doctor Cho.</b>

468

<b>-Hey!
-Doctor Cho.</b>

469
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:54,940
<b>-What should we do?
-What do you think?</b>

470
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:58,320
<b>He'll have to do it.
What other choice does he have?</b>

471
00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:00,360
<b>Will he get fired?</b>

472
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,960
<b>Gang-hwa,</b>

473
00:39:15,790 --> 00:39:18,340
<b>you can let me go now.</b>

474
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:31,850
<b>Those mothers can't
even look me in the eye now.</b>

475
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:35,730
<b>I guess we were pretty scary that day.
They can't say anything to me now.</b>

476
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:39,690
<b>Thanks to you,</b>

477
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,570
<b>living in this town
became a little easier.</b>

478
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:47,200
<b>I'm glad.</b>

479
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:50,240
<b>They can't say anything about Seo-woo now.</b>

480
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:53,370
<b>Come to think of it,
did I hit them too hard?</b>

481
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:55,420
<b>My gosh. That shouldn't
even count as hitting.</b>

482
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:56,880
<b>You know what?</b>

483
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:01,250
<b>You must think this is
some kind of a cafe for moms.</b>

484
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:05,470
<b>This is my place of business.
My sacred place of business.</b>

485
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:11,390
<b>Hyeon-jeong!</b>

486
00:40:11,890 --> 00:40:13,180
<b>I'm so just thirsty.</b>

487
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:19,730
<b>That hit the spot.</b>

488
00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:24,190
<b>Why are you chopping so many green onions?</b>

489
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:27,070
<b>My gosh, it's so spicy. My eyes sting.</b>

490
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:39,790
<b>Hyeon-jeong.</b>

491
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:43,880
<b>I was just passing by.</b>

492
00:40:45,090 --> 00:40:46,970
<b>Have some coffee.</b>

493
00:40:48,090 --> 00:40:49,220
<b>-Okay.
-My gosh.</b>

494
00:40:49,930 --> 00:40:51,560
<b>You have a lot of dishes to wash.</b>

495
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:52,970
<b>It's nothing.</b>

496
00:40:57,310 --> 00:41:00,650
<b>Hyeon-jeong!
The weather is warming up now.</b>

497
00:41:01,770 --> 00:41:03,610
<b>Those are some huge anchovies! Oh, my.</b>

498
00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:09,320
<b>These are some good anchovies.
Are they from Tongyeong?</b>

499
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:18,920
<b>Hyeon-jeong.</b>

500
00:41:19,670 --> 00:41:20,670
<b>And Do-yoen.</b>

501
00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:24,670
<b>This isn't a place you stop by
when you feel like it. What is this place?</b>

502
00:41:25,010 --> 00:41:26,970
<b>A place of business.</b>

503
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:29,220
<b>I love it.</b>

504
00:41:30,010 --> 00:41:32,640
<b>Having a place I can stop by
in my neighborhood.</b>

505
00:41:33,310 --> 00:41:37,140
<b>I didn't have any place I could stop by
in this neighborhood.</b>

506
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:41,060
<b>This feels like a hideout.</b>

507
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:48,570
<b>I have an appointment. I'll get going.</b>

508
00:41:48,650 --> 00:41:49,490
<b>Okay.</b>

509
00:41:49,570 --> 00:41:51,240
<b>Seo-woo doesn't have
private lessons today.</b>

510
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:53,410
<b>Play with her at home
or at the playground.</b>

511
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:55,660
<b>Seo-woo.</b>

512
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:57,700
<b>Mom!</b>

513
00:41:59,870 --> 00:42:03,130
<b>I'm leaving now. Play with the aunt
and I'll see you at home.</b>

514
00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:05,380
<b>Okay? Bye, Ha-jun.</b>

515
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:06,550
<b>Bye.</b>

516
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:07,760
<b>Goodness.</b>

517
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:11,640
<b>Good girl.</b>

518
00:42:17,310 --> 00:42:18,480
<b>Go play.</b>

519
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:21,100
<b>Bye.</b>

520
00:42:21,770 --> 00:42:22,730
<b>Bye, Min-jeong.</b>

521
00:42:28,570 --> 00:42:29,490
<b>Well,</b>

522
00:42:31,150 --> 00:42:33,740
<b>we are friends, right?</b>

523
00:42:36,910 --> 00:42:39,580
<b>Seeing how close we are,</b>

524
00:42:39,830 --> 00:42:42,870
<b>I was wondering
if I could call you guys friends.</b>

525
00:42:49,210 --> 00:42:51,300
<b>Of course. We are best friends.</b>

526
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:52,550
<b>You bet.</b>

527
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:28,840
<b>Hello.</b>

528
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,050
<b>Hi.</b>

529
00:43:30,590 --> 00:43:33,260
<b>We have a lot of beautiful
accessories today. Look around.</b>

530
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:39,010
<b>FRIENDSHIP BRACELET,
SHARE YOUR MEMORIES</b>

531
00:43:39,970 --> 00:43:41,350
<b>Give me three of those.</b>

532
00:43:42,350 --> 00:43:44,440
<b>Are you giving them to your friends?</b>

533
00:43:44,730 --> 00:43:45,690
<b>Yes.</b>

534
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:48,440
<b>-How much are they?
-50,000 won.</b>

535
00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:55,740
<b>-Here you go.
-Sell a lot.</b>

536
00:43:55,820 --> 00:43:57,620
<b>-Wear them well.
-Okay.</b>

537
00:44:10,670 --> 00:44:11,960
<b>It's all my fault.</b>

538
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:17,220
<b>My gosh, what's wrong with you?
Why is this your fault?</b>

539
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:19,800
<b>If I didn't</b>

540
00:44:21,310 --> 00:44:23,180
<b>encourage Gang-hwa</b>

541
00:44:24,770 --> 00:44:26,520
<b>to date Min-jeong back then...</b>

542
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:28,900
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

543
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:30,820
<b>Why would you say that?</b>

544
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:33,860
<b>I was really thankful to you
when you did that.</b>

545
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,030
<b>There must be a way.</b>

546
00:44:37,110 --> 00:44:39,870
<b>I told the shaman to find us a way.</b>

547
00:44:40,490 --> 00:44:42,660
<b>I'm trying to wrap my head around it,</b>

548
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:46,750
<b>but I cannot have you leave me again.</b>

549
00:44:51,130 --> 00:44:52,170
<b>Hyeon-jeong.</b>

550
00:44:52,750 --> 00:44:53,590
<b>Yes?</b>

551
00:44:55,470 --> 00:44:58,010
<b>Everyone is having a hard time
because I came back.</b>

552
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:01,720
<b>I didn't come back to make people suffer.</b>

553
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:05,060
<b>Because of me, Gang-hwa and you</b>

554
00:45:06,350 --> 00:45:07,850
<b>are such in pain.</b>

555
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:13,400
<b>I should have hidden from you guys
and never gotten caught.</b>

556
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:17,150
<b>This is not why I came back at all.</b>

557
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:21,780
<b>I shouldn't have gotten caught.</b>

558
00:45:23,790 --> 00:45:24,910
<b>I shouldn't have.</b>

559
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:33,420
<b>What is it?
Do you have something to tell me?</b>

560
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:37,840
<b>To be honest, I like you.</b>

561
00:45:38,380 --> 00:45:39,550
<b>You're cool.</b>

562
00:45:39,630 --> 00:45:40,930
<b>So what?</b>

563
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:47,230
<b>That's why
I really wanted to tell you this.</b>

564
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:53,310
<b>You should change your pick-up helper.</b>

565
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:54,400
<b>What?</b>

566
00:45:57,110 --> 00:45:59,570
<b>Why? Why must I do that?</b>

567
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:03,070
<b>Everyone is talking about it now.</b>

568
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:05,660
<b>People are saying
your pick-up helper and your husband</b>

569
00:46:06,620 --> 00:46:07,910
<b>are having an affair.</b>

570
00:46:10,750 --> 00:46:12,380
<b>Now, you're spreading groundless rumors?</b>

571
00:46:13,170 --> 00:46:14,500
<b>Are we done here?</b>

572
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:18,800
<b>No, people said that they were
crying at the playground together.</b>

573
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:21,090
<b>It's true.</b>

574
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:24,890
<b>Please go.</b>

575
00:46:27,470 --> 00:46:28,890
<b>Goodness.</b>

576
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:31,060
<b>All right. Let's do it one more time.</b>

577
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:34,230
<b>All right. Here. Goodness.</b>

578
00:46:34,310 --> 00:46:36,070
<b>-Harder?
-Yes, harder!</b>

579
00:46:36,230 --> 00:46:39,280
<b>My gosh, look. I caught it. I got it.</b>

580
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:41,910
<b>All right. Let's do it again.</b>

581
00:46:41,990 --> 00:46:44,200
<b>Again. Let's do it again.</b>

582
00:46:45,370 --> 00:46:46,280
<b>Goodness.</b>

583
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:48,200
<b>One more time. Throw it far.</b>

584
00:46:48,290 --> 00:46:51,370
<b>-Dad, you must be tired. That's enough.
-That's nonsense.</b>

585
00:46:51,710 --> 00:46:54,460
<b>I'm still going strong. Right, Seo-woo?</b>

586
00:46:54,830 --> 00:46:57,420
<b>Grandpa can play with you
for 12 more hours.</b>

587
00:46:57,500 --> 00:46:59,130
<b>All right. One more time!</b>

588
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:02,340
<b>-All right. Gosh.
-He's unstoppable.</b>

589
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:04,050
<b>Goodness.</b>

590
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:06,390
<b>Give me a few minutes.
I'll go and buy some cool drinks.</b>

591
00:47:06,890 --> 00:47:08,310
<b>Sounds great. All right.</b>

592
00:47:08,430 --> 00:47:10,810
<b>You got it. You caught it, Seo-woo.</b>

593
00:47:11,850 --> 00:47:14,940
<b>All right. Look. Grandpa caught it too.</b>

594
00:47:20,490 --> 00:47:23,400
<b>Seo-woo, do you want to sit down
and rest for a bit? Okay.</b>

595
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:26,740
<b>All right. Let's put this here.</b>

596
00:47:27,620 --> 00:47:28,580
<b>Goodness.</b>

597
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:30,700
<b>Gosh.</b>

598
00:47:31,330 --> 00:47:33,790
<b>Where did you get your beautiful looks?</b>

599
00:47:33,870 --> 00:47:39,250
<b>You have pretty eyes, nose, and cheeks.</b>

600
00:47:39,750 --> 00:47:42,260
<b>And even your hands are pretty.
Look at them wriggle.</b>

601
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:44,510
<b>My goodness.</b>

602
00:47:45,430 --> 00:47:47,350
<b>Oh, no. Goodness.</b>

603
00:47:47,430 --> 00:47:49,350
<b>My gosh. Oh, no.</b>

604
00:47:49,930 --> 00:47:53,140
<b>-Are you okay? Oh, goodness.
-Yes.</b>

605
00:47:54,140 --> 00:47:56,230
<b>Seo-woo, don't go anywhere. Stay there.</b>

606
00:47:57,270 --> 00:47:58,730
<b>-Gosh.
-Oh, no.</b>

607
00:48:08,410 --> 00:48:09,370
<b>I know, right?</b>

608
00:48:09,450 --> 00:48:10,910
<b>-Sure.
-What should we play?</b>

609
00:48:10,990 --> 00:48:12,200
<b>Let's play with Mimi.</b>

610
00:48:12,790 --> 00:48:13,750
<b>-Sure. I like that.
-Mom.</b>

611
00:48:13,830 --> 00:48:16,500
<b>Mom said she'd cook tteokbokki for us.</b>

612
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:24,510
<b>-Here.
-Okay.</b>

613
00:48:25,550 --> 00:48:26,800
<b>You should be careful.</b>

614
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:28,550
<b>-Thank you.
-Sure.</b>

615

<b>Dad.</b>

<b>I shouldn't have come. I'm so sorry.</b>

783
01:00:46,830 --> 01:00:48,290
<b>What do you mean?</b>

784
01:00:49,630 --> 01:00:52,840
<b>Yu-ri, it's not your fault.
It's all right.</b>

785
01:00:55,340 --> 01:00:58,470
<b>Why do you always say
everything is all right?</b>

786
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:02,720
<b>It's not all right at all.
You aren't all right.</b>

787
01:01:13,070 --> 01:01:14,280
<b>Yu-ri.</b>

788
01:01:36,590 --> 01:01:38,220
<b>I shouldn't have come back to life.</b>

789
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:40,720
<b>It's not like you wanted to.</b>

790
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:43,350
<b>And you didn't get caught
because you wanted to.</b>

791
01:01:44,180 --> 01:01:46,560
<b>Everyone cries, worries,</b>

792
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:48,480
<b>and sighs when they see me.</b>

793
01:01:51,980 --> 01:01:53,650
<b>No one smiles.</b>

794
01:01:54,820 --> 01:01:56,530
<b>Everyone is tormented because of me.</b>

795
01:01:58,450 --> 01:02:00,740
<b>Everyone who's alive is like that.</b>

796
01:02:00,820 --> 01:02:03,580
<b>They think more about tomorrow than today.</b>

797
01:02:04,450 --> 01:02:08,960
<b>That's why they have a lot of troubles,
sigh a lot, and regret a lot too.</b>

798
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
<b>If they thought they'd live
just another day</b>

799
01:02:13,460 --> 01:02:15,210
<b>like you or other ghosts here,</b>

800
01:02:15,750 --> 01:02:17,550
<b>there's no need to worry about everything.</b>

801
01:02:25,060 --> 01:02:26,600
<b>Goodness.</b>

802
01:02:29,690 --> 01:02:31,190
<b>Ms. Mi-dong...</b>

803
01:02:32,860 --> 01:02:35,820
<b>Yu-ri! You're here. You came.</b>

804
01:02:35,900 --> 01:02:37,780
<b>When did you get here? When?</b>

805
01:02:38,360 --> 01:02:41,280
<b>Yes, Yu-ri came. Our dear Yu-ri.</b>

806
01:02:42,110 --> 01:02:44,280
<b>I thought you were sick of this place.
Why did you come?</b>

807
01:02:44,370 --> 01:02:46,120
<b>This is my home too.</b>

808
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:47,540
<b>I'm glad you're here. I'm glad.</b>

809
01:02:47,620 --> 01:02:49,830
<b>-I'm so glad.
-I missed you.</b>

810
01:02:49,910 --> 01:02:51,420
<b>I'm glad you're here.</b>

811
01:03:01,630 --> 01:03:04,600
<b>Why do you always say
everything is all right?</b>

812
01:03:06,010 --> 01:03:08,970
<b>It's not all right at all.
You aren't all right.</b>

813
01:03:42,630 --> 01:03:44,090
<b>You must've been shocked.</b>

814
01:04:06,320 --> 01:04:07,320
<b>Min-jeong.</b>

815
01:04:09,160 --> 01:04:11,080
<b>Why are you crying? Don't cry.</b>

816
01:04:11,750 --> 01:04:13,910
<b>It wasn't your fault, okay?</b>

817
01:04:16,540 --> 01:04:18,380
<b>Then whose fault is this?</b>

818
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,130
<b>Is it because you're at the hospital
all day long?</b>

819
01:04:26,390 --> 01:04:30,430
<b>I hired a pick-up helper
to return to work, then lost my child.</b>

820
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:33,930
<b>And Seo-woo</b>

821
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:39,860
<b>is slower and grayer than most children.</b>

822
01:04:41,690 --> 01:04:44,110
<b>If all of those aren't my fault,
whose fault is it?</b>

823
01:04:46,360 --> 01:04:47,410
<b>Am I not her mother?</b>

824
01:04:47,490 --> 01:04:48,660
<b>Min-jeong.</b>

825
01:04:49,740 --> 01:04:54,370
<b>When something is wrong with a kid,
everyone blames the mother.</b>

826
01:04:55,580 --> 01:04:58,000
<b>Why do you always say it's not my fault?</b>

827
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:01,340
<b>You said I'm Seo-woo's mother.</b>

828
01:05:04,090 --> 01:05:06,260
<b>Am I really her mother?</b>

829
01:05:12,060 --> 01:05:13,220
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

830
01:05:14,810 --> 01:05:15,850
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

831
01:05:19,690 --> 01:05:21,190
<b>Why are you always</b>

832
01:05:23,230 --> 01:05:24,480
<b>sorry</b>

833
01:05:26,900 --> 01:05:28,240
<b>and fine?</b>

834
01:05:50,930 --> 01:05:52,300
<b>Cha Yu-ri.</b>

835
01:05:55,850 --> 01:05:58,520
<b>Those three syllables
are taboo words to me.</b>

836
01:06:01,310 --> 01:06:02,690
<b>How long</b>

837
01:06:03,900 --> 01:06:06,530
<b>will you keep that door shut to me?</b>

838
01:06:07,610 --> 01:06:09,910
<b>How long will you
keep that door locked up?</b>

839
01:06:11,740 --> 01:06:14,530
<b>You have to open that door
for me to go in.</b>

840
01:06:16,620 --> 01:06:20,290
<b>That's the only way
I can truly be Seo-woo's mom.</b>

841
01:06:44,610 --> 01:06:45,900
<b>The pick-up helper.</b>

842
01:06:52,660 --> 01:06:53,820
<b>That's her.</b>

843
01:06:54,700 --> 01:06:55,620
<b>Yu-ri.</b>

844
01:06:57,540 --> 01:06:58,370
<b>Cha Yu-ri.</b>

845
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:13,680
<b>What</b>

846
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:16,850
<b>do you...</b>

847
01:07:19,220 --> 01:07:20,730
<b>What do you mean?</b>

848
01:07:26,940 --> 01:07:28,400
<b>Seo-woo's biological mother.</b>

849

<b>Cha Yu-ri.</b>

850
01:07:35,530 --> 01:07:36,910
<b>She came back to life.</b>

851
01:08:01,310 --> 01:08:04,560
<b>Why? You can't seem to sleep?</b>

852
01:08:06,900 --> 01:08:09,650
<b>I don't want to waste my time sleeping.</b>

853
01:08:11,690 --> 01:08:14,400
<b>Mom, can you sing for me?</b>

854
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:16,990
<b>What? Which song?</b>

855
01:08:19,740 --> 01:08:20,830
<b>"Pine Tree."</b>

856
01:08:22,040 --> 01:08:23,080
<b>"Pine Tree?"</b>

857
01:08:23,460 --> 01:08:24,870
<b>You remember that?</b>

858
01:08:25,120 --> 01:08:27,290
<b>I used to sing it for you
when you were a baby.</b>

859
01:08:27,540 --> 01:08:30,800
<b>It has been so long,
so I want to listen to it. Please do sing.</b>

860
01:08:36,550 --> 01:08:41,890
<b>Pine tree, pine tree</b>

861
01:08:42,350 --> 01:08:47,520
<b>Your light is evergreen</b>

862
01:08:47,980 --> 01:08:52,860
<b>On a lonely autumn day</b>

863

<b>-Pine tree, pine tree

<b>You are evergreen</b>

872
01:09:45,580 --> 01:09:48,580
<b>Anyway, we established the hierarchy
in this chaotic neighborhood.</b>

873
01:09:48,790 --> 01:09:50,790
<b>That means we're the bosses, right?</b>

874
01:09:51,330 --> 01:09:53,460
<b>This is exactly why
we should be careful around kids.</b>

875
01:09:53,550 --> 01:09:54,630
<b>You already learned.</b>

876
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:57,510
<b>Exactly, she learns very fast.</b>

877
01:09:57,590 --> 01:09:59,010
<b>She called us bosses.</b>

878
01:09:59,550 --> 01:10:02,510
<b>Don't laugh like that
when older ladies are talking.</b>

879
01:10:02,680 --> 01:10:04,680
<b>She should lie down head-first

880
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:07,560
<b>You can't do that nowadays.
You'll get handcuffed.</b>

881

<b>This world is coming to an end.
Let's go out and get some eggs.</b>

882
01:10:11,610 --> 01:10:12,610
<b>Okay.</b>

883
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:20,070
<b>Goodness, she won't even stand up

<b>-Keep the restaurant safe, will you?
-Yes.</b>

885
01:11:09,580 --> 01:11:12,250
<b>I couldn't see

<b>passing by diligently.</b>

888
01:11:46,240 --> 01:11:47,870
<b>It must've been fun</b>

889
01:11:47,950 --> 01:11:52,080
<b>to see how much I loved her
like some kind of an idiot.</b>

890
