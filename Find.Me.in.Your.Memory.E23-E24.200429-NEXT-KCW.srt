1
00:00:10,107 --> 00:00:11,947
<b>What is it? Why did you
want to see me this late?</b>

2
00:00:12,146 --> 00:00:13,587
<b>You're here.</b>

3
00:00:14,146 --> 00:00:15,446
<b>What is it?</b>

4
00:00:17,186 --> 00:00:20,727
<b>There's something
I couldn't tell you.</b>

5
00:00:22,626 --> 00:00:25,527
<b>The reason why
Ha Jin was so tormented...</b>

6
00:00:27,497 --> 00:00:28,826
<b>that she wanted to
take her own life.</b>

7
00:00:30,536 --> 00:00:31,736
<b>What do you mean?</b>

8
00:00:41,746 --> 00:00:43,746
<b>- Ha Na. Over here.
- Yes?</b>

9
00:00:44,746 --> 00:00:47,287
<b>Ha Na, you look so pretty.</b>

10
00:00:47,787 --> 00:00:49,386
<b>- Don't say that.
- My gosh.</b>

11
00:00:49,386 --> 00:00:51,916
<b>No way, you look much prettier now.</b>

12
00:00:53,886 --> 00:00:55,026
<b>Ha Na.</b>

13
00:00:55,026 --> 00:00:56,087
<b>Yeong!</b>

14
00:00:57,757 --> 00:00:58,757
<b>(Delivery Service)</b>

15
00:01:19,216 --> 00:01:22,046
<b>(Find Me in Your Memory)</b>

16
00:01:23,216 --> 00:01:24,617
<b>Tell me now.</b>

17
00:01:25,287 --> 00:01:26,686
<b>She's your friend.</b>

18
00:01:27,287 --> 00:01:29,627
<b>You two learned ballet together
as a kid,</b>

19
00:01:29,987 --> 00:01:32,356
<b>and I heard you two were very close.</b>

20
00:01:33,056 --> 00:01:35,427
<b>I've only seen her
a few times with you.</b>

21
00:01:38,267 --> 00:01:39,996
<b>I don't remember her at all.</b>

22
00:01:42,267 --> 00:01:45,337
<b>If I had known her for so long,
how can this happen?</b>

23
00:01:46,837 --> 00:01:49,046
<b>You never told me about her either.</b>

24
00:01:49,977 --> 00:01:52,017
<b>When you got in
that motorcycle accident,</b>

25
00:01:52,017 --> 00:01:54,186
<b>you were badly hurt and in pain.</b>

26
00:01:54,416 --> 00:01:57,186
<b>So your memory wasn't very stable.</b>

27
00:01:57,787 --> 00:02:00,787
<b>Yeong was the one who was with you
at the time of the accident.</b>

28
00:02:01,156 --> 00:02:03,427
<b>That's why I didn't bring her up.</b>

29
00:02:04,127 --> 00:02:07,127
<b>There was no reason for you
to be reminded of that again.</b>

30
00:02:07,867 --> 00:02:10,296
<b>It was a painful moment for you.</b>

31
00:02:11,337 --> 00:02:13,496
<b>But you said we were close.</b>

32
00:02:15,466 --> 00:02:18,237
<b>Why haven't I seen her to this day?</b>

33
00:02:21,346 --> 00:02:22,607
<b>She left to study abroad...</b>

34
00:02:23,876 --> 00:02:25,617
<b>right after the accident.</b>

35
00:02:26,947 --> 00:02:28,517
<b>She went to study abroad?</b>

36
00:02:28,617 --> 00:02:32,056
<b>Yes, I heard she had been
preparing to go abroad.</b>

37
00:02:32,216 --> 00:02:33,756
<b>It was Russia or something.</b>

38
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:35,887
<b>And she didn't stay in touch
after that.</b>

39
00:02:37,056 --> 00:02:39,297
<b>Wait, does this mean
I have no way of reaching out?</b>

40
00:02:39,297 --> 00:02:40,927
<b>And she never contacted me either?</b>

41
00:02:41,297 --> 00:02:43,397
<b>No, she never contacted you
ever since that time.</b>

42
00:02:48,237 --> 00:02:49,566
<b>Do you have a big headache?</b>

43
00:02:49,966 --> 00:02:51,077
<b>Do you want some medicine?</b>

44
00:02:52,707 --> 00:02:53,776
<b>No.</b>

45
00:02:54,246 --> 00:02:56,577
<b>I'll just get some rest.</b>

46
00:02:57,077 --> 00:02:59,346
<b>Do you want to do that?
You should do that.</b>

47
00:03:00,276 --> 00:03:01,387
<b>Go get some rest.</b>

48
00:03:16,726 --> 00:03:18,367
<b>I can't go in there.</b>

49
00:03:24,677 --> 00:03:26,876
<b>I can't bring myself to see her.</b>

50
00:03:29,147 --> 00:03:30,617
<b>I feel too sorry.</b>

51
00:03:35,216 --> 00:03:37,087
<b>I'm too sorry.</b>

52
00:03:39,587 --> 00:03:41,186
<b>I can't go in there.</b>

53
00:04:02,876 --> 00:04:03,876
<b>Yes, hello?</b>

54
00:04:04,216 --> 00:04:06,346
<b>Doctor Yoo, can you talk right now?</b>

55
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:08,746
<b>Yes, Ha Kyung. What's the occasion?</b>

56
00:04:09,617 --> 00:04:11,286
<b>Wait, is something going on?</b>

57
00:04:11,387 --> 00:04:12,617
<b>I'll tell you in person.</b>

58
00:04:12,617 --> 00:04:13,927
<b>May I see you tomorrow?</b>

59
00:04:13,927 --> 00:04:15,656
<b>The earlier, the better.</b>

60
00:04:16,056 --> 00:04:17,996
<b>Yes, let's do that. I have time.</b>

61
00:04:17,996 --> 00:04:19,256
<b>I'll see you at the clinic.</b>

62
00:04:32,536 --> 00:04:37,007
<b>Ha Jin told the culprit
the passcode to her practice room.</b>

63
00:04:37,747 --> 00:04:39,976
<b>She thought he was her boyfriend.</b>

64
00:04:43,247 --> 00:04:44,517
<b>Yeong...</b>

65
00:04:48,656 --> 00:04:51,557
<b>Yeong died because of me.</b>

66
00:04:53,966 --> 00:04:56,067
<b>She died because of me.</b>

67
00:04:56,866 --> 00:04:59,397
<b>No, it wasn't your fault.</b>

68
00:04:59,397 --> 00:05:00,966
<b>You didn't do anything wrong.</b>

69
00:05:01,267 --> 00:05:03,906
<b>I thought he was Yeong's boyfriend,</b>

70
00:05:06,437 --> 00:05:08,276
<b>so I told him the passcode.</b>

71
00:05:09,007 --> 00:05:10,476
<b>I told him.</b>

72
00:05:10,877 --> 00:05:13,676
<b>I killed her, Doctor Yoo.</b>

73
00:05:14,786 --> 00:05:16,817
<b>If it hadn't been for me,</b>

74
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:20,257
<b>if I was there for her on that day,</b>

75
00:05:21,687 --> 00:05:24,026
<b>this wouldn't have happened.</b>

76
00:05:24,796 --> 00:05:27,327
<b>I killed her, Doctor Yoo.</b>

77
00:05:40,577 --> 00:05:41,577
<b>(Ha Jin)</b>

78
00:05:42,476 --> 00:05:43,476
<b>Are you asleep?</b>

79
00:05:52,387 --> 00:05:53,757
<b>You weren't asleep?</b>

80
00:05:54,486 --> 00:05:57,057
<b>No, I couldn't sleep.</b>

81
00:05:58,356 --> 00:06:00,627
<b>It's pretty late.
Why aren't you asleep?</b>

82
00:06:01,466 --> 00:06:03,327
<b>I couldn't sleep either.</b>

83
00:06:03,567 --> 00:06:06,197
<b>Why? Are you worried about
having a nightmare?</b>

84
00:06:06,767 --> 00:06:08,406
<b>No, it's not that.</b>

85
00:06:11,437 --> 00:06:12,507
<b>To be honest,</b>

86
00:06:14,606 --> 00:06:17,947
<b>I remembered a friend
I had forgotten.</b>

87
00:06:18,747 --> 00:06:20,786
<b>Ha Kyung said
she was a close friend of mine...</b>

88
00:06:20,786 --> 00:06:23,817
<b>who learned ballet with me
as a child.</b>

89
00:06:24,457 --> 00:06:27,627
<b>I don't remember much
other than her name, Yeong.</b>

90
00:06:28,587 --> 00:06:31,127
<b>I wanted to meet her,</b>

91
00:06:32,296 --> 00:06:34,827
<b>but she went to study abroad,
and we lost contact.</b>

92
00:06:35,497 --> 00:06:37,366
<b>So I don't think I can see her.</b>

93
00:06:38,937 --> 00:06:42,007
<b>- I see.
- But this felt really weird.</b>

94
00:06:42,837 --> 00:06:45,337
<b>I was frustrated
and hated the fact...</b>

95
00:06:45,337 --> 00:06:47,447
<b>that I couldn't remember.</b>

96
00:06:49,176 --> 00:06:51,747
<b>But after I remembered new things,</b>

97
00:06:53,447 --> 00:06:54,916
<b>I'm starting to get scared...</b>

98
00:06:55,947 --> 00:06:59,017
<b>that there may be memories
I regret remembering.</b>

99
00:07:02,457 --> 00:07:03,656
<b>This time...</b>

100
00:07:05,096 --> 00:07:08,426
<b>I spend with you is
very precious to me.</b>

101
00:07:09,497 --> 00:07:11,596
<b>I hope that's the case for you too.</b>

102
00:07:13,267 --> 00:07:17,067
<b>What's in the past can
only remain in the past.</b>

103
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:18,807
<b>I know that.</b>

104
00:07:20,377 --> 00:07:24,416
<b>And I know how you felt
as you just told me that.</b>

105
00:07:25,546 --> 00:07:26,747
<b>Thank you.</b>

106
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,416
<b>And I feel the same way too.</b>

107
00:07:30,786 --> 00:07:33,786
<b>Every moment I spend with you is...</b>

108
00:07:34,526 --> 00:07:36,057
<b>very precious to me,</b>

109
00:07:37,026 --> 00:07:38,497
<b>so much so that it scares me.</b>

110
00:07:42,726 --> 00:07:45,166
<b>It's late. You should get to sleep.
I'll go to sleep too.</b>

111
00:07:46,596 --> 00:07:47,606
<b>Okay.</b>

112
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:49,807
<b>Let's talk again tomorrow.</b>

113
00:07:50,776 --> 00:07:51,837
<b>Goodnight.</b>

114
00:08:11,426 --> 00:08:14,327
<b>Ha Jin asked you
about Ms. Jung Seo Yeon?</b>

115
00:08:16,096 --> 00:08:19,067
<b>Yes. She asked me about Yeong.</b>

116
00:08:21,507 --> 00:08:22,966
<b>She doesn't remember everything.</b>

117
00:08:22,966 --> 00:08:25,707
<b>She just remembered
her name and a few moments.</b>

118
00:08:26,976 --> 00:08:29,707
<b>So I told her that
she used to learn ballet with her,</b>

119
00:08:29,707 --> 00:08:32,577
<b>and that they're not in touch now
after she went to study abroad.</b>

120
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:36,046
<b>Was she convinced
after you said that?</b>

121
00:08:36,647 --> 00:08:37,786
<b>For now.</b>

122
00:08:38,716 --> 00:08:40,927
<b>I thought she would
make a visit to you soon.</b>

123
00:08:40,927 --> 00:08:42,386
<b>That's why
I wanted to see you right away.</b>

124
00:08:42,386 --> 00:08:44,396
<b>We have to keep the story straight.</b>

125
00:08:44,626 --> 00:08:45,626
<b>I see.</b>

126
00:08:45,927 --> 00:08:47,027
<b>What will happen...</b>

127
00:08:48,766 --> 00:08:50,996
<b>if she remembers...</b>

128
00:08:51,736 --> 00:08:53,366
<b>everything?</b>

129
00:08:55,266 --> 00:08:56,606
<b>Will she try...</b>

130
00:08:57,236 --> 00:08:59,307
<b>to harm herself once again?</b>

131
00:09:01,307 --> 00:09:04,146
<b>No. You said she understood.</b>

132
00:09:04,146 --> 00:09:05,447
<b>She wouldn't do that.</b>

133
00:09:05,677 --> 00:09:07,587
<b>Maybe now isn't the right time,</b>

134
00:09:08,287 --> 00:09:10,687
<b>but I'll talk with her later.</b>

135
00:09:11,356 --> 00:09:13,486
<b>Don't be too worried.</b>

136
00:09:15,157 --> 00:09:16,187
<b>Okay.</b>

137
00:09:24,067 --> 00:09:28,606
<b>This time I spend with you is
very precious to me.</b>

138
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:31,577
<b>I hope that's the case for you too.</b>

139
00:09:32,677 --> 00:09:36,177
<b>What's in the past can
only remain in the past.</b>

140
00:09:51,496 --> 00:09:53,126
<b>Weren't you sleeping?</b>

141
00:09:53,527 --> 00:09:54,966
<b>Where did you go
so early in the morning?</b>

142
00:09:56,027 --> 00:09:57,297
<b>You're up early.</b>

143
00:09:57,866 --> 00:10:00,136
<b>I felt under the weather,
so I took a walk.</b>

144
00:10:00,697 --> 00:10:02,766
<b>You should've woken me up
so I could tag along.</b>

145
00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:05,077
<b>I'll do that next time.</b>

146
00:10:09,177 --> 00:10:11,346
<b>How's your headache? Is it better?</b>

147
00:10:12,577 --> 00:10:14,646
<b>Yes. It doesn't hurt anymore.</b>

148
00:10:16,646 --> 00:10:17,787
<b>Coffee?</b>

149
00:10:20,157 --> 00:10:22,986
<b>Let me change. Let's have toast.</b>

150
00:10:23,087 --> 00:10:24,457
<b>- Okay.
- Okay.</b>

151
00:10:27,157 --> 00:10:29,126
<b>- I want chocolate jam.
- No.</b>

152
00:10:30,197 --> 00:10:31,437
<b>I'll give you eggs, though.</b>

153
00:10:32,537 --> 00:10:33,766
<b>I'm so thankful.</b>

154
00:10:41,506 --> 00:10:45,077
<b>Hello, everyone.
This is the 9 p.m. news.</b>

155

<b>Hello, everyone.

<b>Did I just get rejected?</b>

<b>Okay, sounds good.</b>

465
00:30:36,505 --> 00:30:40,035
<b>Ha Kyung is going to be furious
if I go out this late.</b>

466
00:30:48,785 --> 00:30:49,885
<b>Ha Jin.</b>

467
00:30:53,755 --> 00:30:55,055
<b>Ha Jin, are you asleep?</b>

468
00:31:01,925 --> 00:31:03,326
<b>You're asleep, aren't you?</b>

469
00:31:05,766 --> 00:31:07,135
<b>I had something to tell you.</b>

470
00:31:07,966 --> 00:31:09,106
<b>I'll tell you tomorrow.</b>

471
00:31:11,606 --> 00:31:12,835
<b>Good night.</b>

472
00:31:33,295 --> 00:31:34,626
<b>I'm inside.</b>

473
00:31:34,765 --> 00:31:37,066
<b>You can come in
after the movie begins.</b>

474
00:31:44,535 --> 00:31:46,035
<b>Why are you here so early?</b>

475
00:31:46,936 --> 00:31:48,646
<b>I got too nervous
to leave you here alone.</b>

476
00:31:57,285 --> 00:31:58,816
<b>Don't mind them.</b>

477
00:32:05,725 --> 00:32:06,725
<b>Here.</b>

478
00:32:20,105 --> 00:32:22,045
<b>(Flat tire)</b>

479
00:32:23,075 --> 00:32:25,015
<b>I haven't watched
a late-night movie for a while.</b>

480
00:32:25,776 --> 00:32:26,776
<b>Me too.</b>

481
00:32:27,646 --> 00:32:30,485
<b>This is my first time
after seeing my movie alone.</b>

482
00:32:30,586 --> 00:32:33,056
<b>It's also my first time
after I saw your movie.</b>

483
00:32:34,186 --> 00:32:36,355
<b>The last movie
we watched is the same too.</b>

484
00:32:47,735 --> 00:32:50,665
<b>Since it's a shame to go home
so early, let's have some popcorn.</b>

485
00:32:51,975 --> 00:32:53,605
<b>You want more popcorn?</b>

486
00:32:54,876 --> 00:32:56,346
<b>I just don't want to go home.</b>

487
00:32:56,346 --> 00:32:57,406
<b>Okay.</b>

488
00:32:57,945 --> 00:32:59,876
<b>What? Why is she here?</b>

489
00:32:59,876 --> 00:33:01,146
<b>I thought she was asleep.</b>

490
00:33:01,146 --> 00:33:02,485
<b>That's Ha Kyung.</b>

491
00:33:03,285 --> 00:33:05,056
<b>Didn't you tell her that
you were going to the movies?</b>

492
00:33:05,515 --> 00:33:07,855
<b>I thought she might get mad,
so I snuck out.</b>

493
00:33:08,325 --> 00:33:09,885
<b>But you're here with me.</b>

494
00:33:10,225 --> 00:33:11,926
<b>She'll get pretty angry.</b>

495
00:33:15,966 --> 00:33:17,126
<b>Yeo Ha Kyung.</b>

496
00:33:22,336 --> 00:33:23,836
<b>- Hello.
- Hello.</b>

497
00:33:24,406 --> 00:33:25,635
<b>Why are you here?</b>

498
00:33:25,635 --> 00:33:28,346
<b>We came to watch a movie.
I didn't have any popcorn.</b>

499
00:33:28,346 --> 00:33:31,205
<b>But still. At this hour?
Without telling me?</b>

500
00:33:31,376 --> 00:33:33,215
<b>What if people take pictures of you?</b>

501
00:33:34,116 --> 00:33:36,445
<b>Didn't you come
knowing that I was here?</b>

502
00:33:36,445 --> 00:33:38,955
<b>No, I came to watch a movie.</b>

503
00:33:38,955 --> 00:33:39,955
<b>With who?</b>

504
00:33:40,416 --> 00:33:43,226
<b>What do you mean? I came by myself.</b>

505
00:33:43,585 --> 00:33:45,356
<b>- That's my jacket.
- No, I got this.</b>

506
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:46,455
<b>- You have makeup on.
- No.</b>

507
00:33:46,455 --> 00:33:47,996
<b>My... My movie is about...</b>

508
00:33:47,996 --> 00:33:49,666
<b>Guess who?</b>

509
00:33:53,465 --> 00:33:54,465
<b>Jo Il Kwon?</b>

510
00:33:57,005 --> 00:33:58,205
<b>Hello.</b>

511
00:33:58,436 --> 00:34:00,275
<b>What's going on between you two?</b>

512
00:34:00,476 --> 00:34:01,645
<b>Well...</b>

513
00:34:01,945 --> 00:34:03,746
<b>I was passing by,</b>

514
00:34:04,445 --> 00:34:06,075
<b>and I was glad to see her.</b>

515
00:34:06,075 --> 00:34:08,546
<b>You were glad to see her
as you were passing by,</b>

516
00:34:09,116 --> 00:34:10,916
<b>and you two are close enough
to do something like that?</b>

517
00:34:11,286 --> 00:34:12,486
<b>Well, I...</b>

518
00:34:12,755 --> 00:34:14,416
<b>So it's...</b>

519
00:34:14,856 --> 00:34:16,226
<b>We're dating.</b>

520
00:34:17,455 --> 00:34:19,195
<b>I'm dating Ha Kyung.</b>

521
00:34:37,345 --> 00:34:41,616
<b>Goodness, you denied it so much.</b>

522
00:34:42,215 --> 00:34:43,686
<b>Things happened.</b>

523
00:34:43,986 --> 00:34:46,755
<b>- I'm so proud of you, Ha Kyung.
- Stop it.</b>

524
00:34:46,755 --> 00:34:49,356
<b>Great job.</b>

525
00:34:49,585 --> 00:34:52,056
<b>Try to work things out.
Mr. Jo is a great guy.</b>

526
00:34:52,325 --> 00:34:53,655
<b>He is.</b>

527
00:34:54,325 --> 00:34:56,465
<b>When did you become such a big girl?</b>

528
00:34:56,595 --> 00:34:58,496
<b>I'm so proud of you, kiddo.</b>

529
00:34:59,166 --> 00:35:00,965
<b>Anyway, what's that?</b>

530
00:35:01,335 --> 00:35:02,405
<b>That looks great.</b>

531
00:35:02,765 --> 00:35:05,976
<b>What is?
Your face is gleaming today.</b>

532
00:35:06,806 --> 00:35:09,046
<b>So? Do you want me to
pound this on your face?</b>

533
00:35:09,046 --> 00:35:10,106
<b>Pound me.</b>

534
00:35:10,246 --> 00:35:11,416
<b>Look up.</b>

535
00:35:12,676 --> 00:35:13,775
<b>Like this.</b>

536
00:35:15,186 --> 00:35:18,085
<b>Perfect.
You'll definitely kiss him tonight.</b>

537
00:35:20,486 --> 00:35:21,486
<b>What was that?</b>

538
00:35:23,255 --> 00:35:25,595
<b>- I already...
- You already what?</b>

539
00:35:28,866 --> 00:35:31,226
<b>Gosh! Are you insane?</b>

540
00:35:31,536 --> 00:35:32,666
<b>When?</b>

541
00:35:37,005 --> 00:35:38,376
<b>Why do you two look so awkward?</b>

542
00:35:38,376 --> 00:35:40,106
<b>It's not like
you met for the first time.</b>

543
00:35:42,005 --> 00:35:43,445
<b>There must be a misunderstanding.</b>

544
00:35:43,445 --> 00:35:45,176
<b>I'm not that close to him.</b>

545
00:35:45,546 --> 00:35:47,116
<b>We just work together.</b>

546
00:35:47,116 --> 00:35:48,816
<b>Gosh, no way.</b>

547
00:35:48,816 --> 00:35:50,585
<b>When you told us
about Mr. Jo's place,</b>

548
00:35:50,585 --> 00:35:52,655
<b>you said you were like
family with him.</b>

549
00:35:52,655 --> 00:35:54,655
<b>You're right.
I heard you say that too.</b>

550
00:35:54,655 --> 00:35:56,455
<b>We're like family?</b>

551
00:35:56,556 --> 00:35:59,226
<b>I didn't know
you thought of me like that.</b>

552
00:35:59,226 --> 00:36:00,895
<b>Right.</b>

553
00:36:01,395 --> 00:36:02,965
<b>This is so uncanny.</b>

554
00:36:03,325 --> 00:36:05,835
<b>Who knew we'd end up as two couples?</b>

555
00:36:06,465 --> 00:36:08,666
<b>It's best to eat something
when things get awkward.</b>

556
00:36:08,965 --> 00:36:10,306
<b>Eat up.</b>

557
00:36:11,505 --> 00:36:12,505
<b>Ha Kyung.</b>

558
00:36:13,106 --> 00:36:14,176
<b>Open your mouth.</b>

559
00:36:18,316 --> 00:36:19,845
<b>I'll feed myself.</b>

560
00:36:19,845 --> 00:36:22,715
<b>Come on.
Wait, it's falling. It's falling.</b>

561
00:36:26,916 --> 00:36:28,686
<b>- It's good.
- Is it?</b>

562
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:30,455
<b>- Thank you.
- Sure.</b>

563
00:36:34,255 --> 00:36:36,265
<b>What? Do I have
something on my face?</b>

564
00:36:37,726 --> 00:36:40,695
<b>Do you really have no idea,
or are you asking me to test you?</b>

565
00:36:45,335 --> 00:36:46,335
<b>Well...</b>

566
00:37:37,455 --> 00:37:39,726
<b>Don't they look so good together?</b>

567
00:37:40,655 --> 00:37:42,126
<b>I knew they'd look great,</b>

568
00:37:42,496 --> 00:37:44,726
<b>but they look
even cuter than I thought.</b>

569
00:37:45,635 --> 00:37:46,796
<b>Are you that happy?</b>

570
00:37:48,636 --> 00:37:51,066
<b>Ha Kyung was never able to do
everything that she wanted...</b>

571
00:37:51,066 --> 00:37:52,936
<b>because she had to take care of me.</b>

572
00:37:56,975 --> 00:37:59,276
<b>I felt bad, thinking that I was
the only one who was happy.</b>

573
00:38:00,875 --> 00:38:02,686
<b>But that worry is long gone now.</b>

574
00:38:14,695 --> 00:38:16,325
<b>"Breaking news."</b>

575
00:38:16,325 --> 00:38:19,595
<b>"A man was charged for murder..."</b>

576

<b>Hello.</b>

577
00:38:25,875 --> 00:38:27,006
<b>- Hello.
- Hello.</b>

578
00:38:27,006 --> 00:38:28,306
<b>Hello.</b>

579
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:29,475
<b>Nice to meet you.</b>

580
00:38:29,475 --> 00:38:30,676
<b>I came here because...</b>

581
00:38:30,676 --> 00:38:32,715
<b>I wanted to talk
about today's interview briefly.</b>

582
00:38:34,715 --> 00:38:37,386
<b>What is it?
Why did you suddenly smile?</b>

583
00:38:38,115 --> 00:38:39,355
<b>I was just reminded of that time...</b>

584
00:38:39,355 --> 00:38:41,556
<b>when I had first met
Anchor Lee in this room.</b>

585
00:38:42,485 --> 00:38:46,296
<b>Back then, I was worried sick
that he'd criticize you so much.</b>

586
00:38:47,556 --> 00:38:48,625
<b>But now...</b>

587
00:38:49,195 --> 00:38:50,266
<b>"But now"?</b>

588
00:38:54,495 --> 00:38:56,835
<b>- I guess you could say that.
- Silence.</b>

589
00:38:56,835 --> 00:38:58,166
<b>Silence. I need to film soon.</b>

590
00:38:58,166 --> 00:39:00,136
<b>I'm glad you're not nervous.</b>

591
00:39:00,136 --> 00:39:03,676
<b>This is just a test, so relax, okay?</b>

592
00:39:03,676 --> 00:39:05,146
<b>Okay.</b>

593
00:39:05,146 --> 00:39:06,575

594
00:39:06,575 --> 00:39:07,615
<b>Okay.</b>

595
00:39:07,875 --> 00:39:08,886
<b>Focus.</b>

596
00:39:19,225 --> 00:39:21,256
<b>The meeting ended later
than I had expected,</b>

597
00:39:21,256 --> 00:39:22,995
<b>so I don't think I can be there.</b>

598
00:39:23,526 --> 00:39:25,695
<b>I really wanted to watch you.
I'm disappointed.</b>

two open recruitments a year.</b>

<b>With this new recruitment system,</b>

623
00:40:37,266 --> 00:40:40,075
<b>it'll be difficult to predict
the right time for job hunting.</b>

<b>on one's competence.</b>

628

<b>prefer new recruits

<b>What do you mean?</b>

<b>For example,</b>

<b>did you know that his ex had died?</b>

709

<b>Sorry?</b>

<b>Luckily, the doctor reattached

<b>So it's not life-threatening.</b>

760

<b>But he's psychologically unstable.</b>

<b>I don't think he can have

<b>As you know, he tries

771
00:50:32,125 --> 00:50:34,266
<b>My name is Yoo Sung Hyuk.</b>

772
00:50:37,165 --> 00:50:39,706
<b>I invited myself in here
because I thought...</b>

773
00:50:39,706 --> 00:50:42,006
<b>it'd be nice for us to talk.
I hope you don't mind.</b>

774
00:50:45,306 --> 00:50:47,675
<b>What's outside the window?</b>

775
00:50:48,016 --> 00:50:49,885
<b>It looks like
you're staring at the sky.</b>

776
00:50:51,885 --> 00:50:53,716
<b>Did Seo Yeon say something to you?</b>

777
00:50:59,125 --> 00:51:00,355
<b>Do you know her?</b>

778
00:51:00,996 --> 00:51:02,365
<b>Of course.</b>

779
00:51:06,595 --> 00:51:08,696
<b>I used to be
Anchor Lee Jeong Hoon's...</b>

780
00:51:09,706 --> 00:51:12,206
<b>doctor for a long time.</b>

781
00:51:13,276 --> 00:51:14,976
<b>You're that jerk's doctor?</b>

782
00:51:16,345 --> 00:51:18,476
<b>I wanted to talk to you...</b>

783
00:51:19,446 --> 00:51:22,486
<b>because I wanted to find out
something about Anchor Lee.</b>

784
00:51:24,246 --> 00:51:25,486
<b>What do you say?</b>

785
00:51:26,155 --> 00:51:28,316
<b>Are you interested
in talking to me now?</b>

786
00:51:46,306 --> 00:51:48,835
<b>I'm sure you know the woman...</b>

787
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:51,605
<b>Anchor Lee is dating now.</b>

788
00:51:52,375 --> 00:51:54,446
<b>She's an actress named Yeo Ha Jin.</b>

789
00:51:56,446 --> 00:51:58,516
<b>I heard she used to
be Seo Yeon's friend.</b>

790
00:52:01,516 --> 00:52:04,825
<b>So I can sort of understand...</b>

791
00:52:05,655 --> 00:52:10,266
<b>how Lee Jeong Hoon, Jung Seo Yeon,
and Yeo Ha Jin are connected.</b>

792
00:52:10,726 --> 00:52:12,865
<b>But I'm curious...</b>

793
00:52:13,536 --> 00:52:16,536
<b>about how you fit into all of this.
That intrigues me.</b>

794
00:52:18,435 --> 00:52:21,006
<b>- Aren't you Jeong Hoon's doctor?
- Yes.</b>

795
00:52:21,006 --> 00:52:23,046
<b>Why are you asking me that?</b>

796
00:52:24,405 --> 00:52:26,776
<b>Your patient is Lee Jeong Hoon,
not me.</b>

797
00:52:27,175 --> 00:52:29,145
<b>I want to know the truth.</b>

798
00:52:29,645 --> 00:52:32,556
<b>Sometimes,
patients lie to their doctors...</b>

799
00:52:33,115 --> 00:52:35,956
<b>because they want other people
to say that they are normal,</b>

800
00:52:37,556 --> 00:52:40,956
<b>but you see,
I'm not that easy to fool.</b>

801
00:52:51,966 --> 00:52:53,135
<b>So...</b>

802
00:52:54,375 --> 00:52:56,046
<b>you want me...</b>

803
00:52:57,776 --> 00:52:59,875
<b>to tell you the truth?</b>

804
00:53:04,845 --> 00:53:06,716
<b>Can you help me up?</b>

805
00:53:15,865 --> 00:53:17,425
<b>Where are the scissors?</b>

806
00:53:18,095 --> 00:53:20,236
<b>I definitely had a pair
when I went in...</b>

807
00:53:20,236 --> 00:53:21,935
<b>to check on the prisoner
serving a life sentence.</b>

808
00:53:22,365 --> 00:53:23,966
<b>Moon Seong Ho, what are you doing?</b>

809
00:53:23,966 --> 00:53:25,306
<b>Put that down now!</b>

810
00:53:25,306 --> 00:53:27,736
<b>You should be careful
with your guns.</b>

811
00:53:28,476 --> 00:53:30,046
<b>Do you want to see him die?</b>

812
00:53:30,145 --> 00:53:31,206
<b>I doubt that.</b>

813
00:53:31,345 --> 00:53:32,405
<b>Put the gun down and step back.</b>

814
00:53:32,405 --> 00:53:33,946
<b>Hey, Moon Seong Ho.</b>

815
00:53:34,375 --> 00:53:36,816
<b>- Don't get worked up. You and I...
- Easy, easy.</b>

816
00:53:37,286 --> 00:53:39,355
<b>Keep your mouth shut
unless you want to die.</b>

817
00:53:39,355 --> 00:53:42,526
<b>Don't tell me this was
all part of your plan.</b>

818
00:53:42,526 --> 00:53:44,256
<b>Well, not really.</b>

819
00:53:44,786 --> 00:53:46,825
<b>But thanks to you,
things have gotten very easier.</b>

820
00:53:46,825 --> 00:53:47,925
<b>Hey, guys.</b>

821
00:53:48,155 --> 00:53:49,865
<b>I'm not scared of dying.</b>

822
00:53:49,925 --> 00:53:51,226
<b>But you are.</b>

823
00:53:52,125 --> 00:53:54,266
<b>If this guy dies,
you'll be in big trouble.</b>

824
00:53:54,266 --> 00:53:56,335
<b>Don't do this. Just tell them...</b>

825
00:53:56,335 --> 00:53:57,966
<b>- your demand.
- I told you to be quiet.</b>

826
00:53:57,966 --> 00:53:59,036
<b>What do you want?</b>

827
00:53:59,206 --> 00:54:00,835
<b>Let go of the hostage first.</b>

828
00:54:02,506 --> 00:54:03,605
<b>This hurts.</b>

829
00:54:05,446 --> 00:54:07,175
<b>- Hey.
- Don't come near me.</b>

830
00:54:07,175 --> 00:54:08,875
<b>- Stay there.
- Put down the scissors.</b>

831
00:54:08,875 --> 00:54:10,216
<b>- Don't come near me.
- Put that down!</b>

832
00:54:10,885 --> 00:54:12,615
<b>I told you to stay there.</b>

833
00:54:14,016 --> 00:54:15,885
<b>- Sir!
- Get him.</b>

834
00:54:21,696 --> 00:54:22,696
<b>Come back here!</b>

835
00:54:25,226 --> 00:54:26,435
<b>- Darn it.
- The staircase on the other side.</b>

836
00:54:29,536 --> 00:54:30,536
<b>Are you all right?</b>

837
00:54:37,046 --> 00:54:38,776
<b>- Officer Jo, check the back.
- Yes, sir.</b>

838
00:54:53,325 --> 00:54:55,556
<b>It's all done. Rest up for now.
I'll call you once it's ready.</b>

839
00:54:55,556 --> 00:54:57,296
<b>- Okay. Thank you.
- Sure.</b>

840
00:55:10,306 --> 00:55:12,645
<b>But I can't help

<b>Will you be okay with that?</b>

843
00:55:38,806 --> 00:55:42,006
<b>Ha Jin, is it before your event?</b>

844
00:55:42,506 --> 00:55:44,776
<b>It was time, so I figured
your event already started.</b>

845
00:55:44,776 --> 00:55:47,145
<b>I'll start in about five minutes.</b>

846
00:55:47,415 --> 00:55:49,716
<b>I wanted to hear your voice
even for a few seconds.</b>

847
00:55:51,486 --> 00:55:53,355
<b>Then, do you want
to meet up afterward?</b>

848
00:55:53,355 --> 00:55:54,885
<b>I miss you too.</b>

849
00:55:56,286 --> 00:55:57,556
<b>Sure. Sounds great.</b>

850
00:55:57,556 --> 00:55:59,956
<b>Okay. I'll go to your house later.</b>

851
00:55:59,956 --> 00:56:01,855
<b>Why don't you rest up
after your event?</b>

852
00:56:04,066 --> 00:56:06,766
<b>By the way, I have a question.</b>

853
00:56:08,835 --> 00:56:10,435
<b>Are you happy now?</b>

854
00:56:13,776 --> 00:56:15,405
<b>You know my answer.</b>

855

<b>What about you, Ha Jin?</b>

859
00:56:30,585 --> 00:56:32,155
<b>I told you my answer.</b>

860
00:56:33,125 --> 00:56:36,496
<b>I said every single moment
I spend with you is precious to me.</b>

<b>I...</b>

922
01:01:12,365 --> 01:01:14,175
<b>love her a lot.</b>

923
01:01:29,885 --> 01:01:30,956
<b>Ha Na.</b>

924
01:01:51,375 --> 01:01:53,716
<b>(Find Me in Your Memory)</b>

925
01:01:53,946 --> 01:01:55,375
<b>What's with you?</b>

926
01:01:55,375 --> 01:01:58,316
<b>Why did you lie?
Why did you let me just forget her?</b>

927
01:01:58,585 --> 01:02:00,316
<b>I love you a lot, Ha Jin.</b>

928

<b>Please let me be alone for a moment.</b>

929
01:02:02,885 --> 01:02:06,125
<b>It's about time you stopped.
It has been eight years already.</b>

<b>Let's go back to the time
when we didn't know each other.</b>

934
01:02:13,036 --> 01:02:15,165
<b>- Are you with Ha Jin?
- Is something going on?</b>

935
01:02:15,165 --> 01:02:17,435
<b>She suddenly disappeared,
and she left her phone at home.</b>

936
01:02:17,435 --> 01:02:20,075
<b>You promised
you'll never say goodbye.</b>

<b>I'm sorry.
