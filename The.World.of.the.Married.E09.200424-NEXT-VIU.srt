<b>Yes.</b>

5
00:00:32,464 --> 00:00:33,595
<b>That's quite unexpected.</b>

6
00:00:34,565 --> 00:00:36,695
<b>I thought you came to talk about work.</b>

7
00:00:37,834 --> 00:00:41,074
<b>From what I heard, there are some people...</b>

8

9

<b>It's not right to ask you for help regarding work.</b>

10

<b>I know better than that.</b>

11
00:00:50,745 --> 00:00:53,545
<b>So you don't want me to do anything since I'm not directly involved...</b>

12
00:00:53,745 --> 00:00:54,955

13

<b>Is that what you're planning right now?</b>

17
00:01:11,334 --> 00:01:13,265
<b>No, it's nothing that grand.</b>

18
00:01:15,175 --> 00:01:18,675
<b>I personally don't think it's a good idea...</b>

19

<b>to get others involved in a family feud.</b>

20

21

<b>I'm sure you of all people...</b>

23
00:01:44,205 --> 00:01:45,735
<b>Yes, I understand.</b>

24
00:01:47,105 --> 00:01:48,235
<b>But...</b>

25
00:01:49,105 --> 00:01:52,004
<b>I don't intend to take anyone's side.</b>

26
00:01:52,804 --> 00:01:54,774
<b>I don't think that's right.</b>

27

32

<b>What's your purpose?</b>

41
00:03:32,105 --> 00:03:33,644
<b>I thought you wanted me to join.</b>

42
00:03:35,314 --> 00:03:37,445
<b>I just need to know why you're doing this.</b>

43
00:03:40,045 --> 00:03:42,114
<b>Are you doing this for peace?</b>

44
00:03:43,314 --> 00:03:44,755
<b>Or are you trying to fight me?</b>

45
00:03:49,855 --> 00:03:50,894
<b>Just think of it...</b>

46
00:03:52,494 --> 00:03:54,964
<b>as my way of warning Tae Oh.</b>

47
00:03:55,994 --> 00:03:57,635
<b>I figured he might be more careful...</b>

48
00:03:59,464 --> 00:04:01,475
<b>if he finds out that I joined the association.</b>

49
00:04:05,945 --> 00:04:08,644
<b>What exactly did my husband do that you want him to be careful?</b>

50
00:04:20,225 --> 00:04:21,395
<b>Your husband...</b>

<b>I know it's hard to believe, but it's the truth.</b>

53
00:04:41,475 --> 00:04:42,775
<b>I worry about you.</b>

54
00:04:44,215 --> 00:04:46,743
<b>Don't you think you need to receive counseling?</b>

55
00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:48,114
<b>You're the one that worries me.</b>

56
00:04:49,215 --> 00:04:50,485
<b>I told you.</b>

57
00:04:51,855 --> 00:04:53,284
<b>You don't know Tae Oh.</b>

58
00:04:53,285 --> 00:04:55,693
<b>You must want to sway me.</b>

59
00:04:55,694 --> 00:04:57,494
<b>I'm not trying to start a fight.</b>

60

<b>I'm just trying to tell you what you don't know.</b>

61
00:05:07,405 --> 00:05:09,245
<b>Make sure your husband doesn't cross the line.</b>

62
00:05:12,244 --> 00:05:13,905
<b>Please. I beg of you.</b>

63
00:05:38,934 --> 00:05:40,405
<b>What are you trying to do?</b>

64
00:05:44,804 --> 00:05:46,574
<b>Can't you just stay quiet?</b>

65
00:05:48,175 --> 00:05:49,215
<b>No.</b>

66
00:05:56,954 --> 00:06:00,485
<b>Have you lost your mind? Why would you let her join?</b>

67
00:06:00,585 --> 00:06:01,693
<b>I sent them gifts every year...</b>

68
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:03,331
<b>and invited them to dinner every time the season changed.</b>

69
00:06:03,355 --> 00:06:05,715
<b>I spent so much time and effort on the women's association.</b>

70
00:06:05,994 --> 00:06:08,763
<b>I wanted to make sure they never talk badly of your marriage...</b>

71

<b>That's enough.</b>

72
00:06:10,335 --> 00:06:12,003
<b>You already think it's an embarrassment,</b>

73
00:06:12,004 --> 00:06:13,564
<b>so imagine what others would think.</b>

74
00:06:14,634 --> 00:06:15,775
<b>My gosh.</b>

75
00:06:19,905 --> 00:06:22,314
<b>- Is it him?
- Don't get involved.</b>

76
00:06:23,574 --> 00:06:24,844
<b>I'll take care of it.</b>

<b>How about we go on a date tonight?</b>

80

<b>when you weren't home.</b>

86

<b>Are you also telling me that I'm overreacting?</b>

87
00:07:13,764 --> 00:07:16,204
<b>I'm just saying we should wait for the investigation results.</b>

88

<b>Why don't I stay with you at your place for a while?</b>

89

<b>Let's do that. I don't mind it at all.</b>

90

<b>Is this table okay for you?</b>

91
00:07:59,905 --> 00:08:01,114
<b>Should we sit somewhere else?</b>

92
00:08:02,744 --> 00:08:03,944
<b>Do you feel uncomfortable?</b>

93
00:08:05,215 --> 00:08:07,915
<b>No, I'm not saying I feel that way.</b>

94

<b>Do you feel uncomfortable?</b>

<b>No, I think we're fine.</b>

<b>I really like the pinot noir they started selling here last week.</b>

97
00:08:39,984 --> 00:08:41,155
<b>Would you like to try some?</b>

98
00:08:43,454 --> 00:08:44,755
<b>No, maybe next time.</b>

99

<b>I don't think I should drink today.</b>

100

<b>Okay then.</b>

101
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:09,915
<b>Should we just join them?</b>

<b>Sun Woo is not your wife anymore.</b>

<b>It must bother you that your ex-wife is dating.</b>

<b>I couldn't care less what she does.</b>

<b>Just seeing her makes me uncomfortable, that's all.</b>

110

<b>Maybe it's because they're both doctors.</b>

00:15:26,655 --> 00:15:28,895
<b>Hating someone that much...</b>

160
00:15:29,454 --> 00:15:31,525
<b>takes a lot of passion.</b>

161
00:15:35,165 --> 00:15:39,564
<b>Do you still think I'm hung up on my ex-husband?</b>

162
00:15:40,234 --> 00:15:43,734
<b>Whatever the case may be, don't you want to shake it off and start anew?</b>

163
00:15:48,275 --> 00:15:49,415
<b>Joon Young...</b>

164
00:15:51,584 --> 00:15:54,284
<b>had a hard time accepting the divorce...</b>

165
00:15:54,285 --> 00:15:55,915
<b>and his dad's second marriage.</b>

166
00:15:57,515 --> 00:15:59,425
<b>I can't add to it.</b>

167
00:16:10,535 --> 00:16:11,665
<b>Are you going somewhere?</b>

168
00:16:14,905 --> 00:16:16,775
<b>I'm going to have a drink with a friend.</b>

169
00:16:29,484 --> 00:16:31,385
<b>On the rooftop.</b>

170
00:16:31,584 --> 00:16:33,854
<b>- Whatever.
- I'm serious.</b>

171
00:16:35,454 --> 00:16:36,594
<b>That's understandable.</b>

172
00:16:37,594 --> 00:16:40,224
<b>- What does that mean?
- Nothing.</b>

173
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,265
<b>Really?</b>

174
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:46,604
<b>I don't know.</b>

175
00:16:53,245 --> 00:16:55,814
<b>- What are you doing here?
- What else?</b>

176
00:16:56,214 --> 00:16:58,285
<b>I came in to have a drink and saw you.</b>

177
00:16:59,545 --> 00:17:02,184
<b>I'll give you two some privacy.</b>

178
00:17:10,294 --> 00:17:11,395
<b>Let's drink together.</b>

179
00:17:57,004 --> 00:17:58,274
<b>This is on the house...</b>

180
00:17:59,444 --> 00:18:00,944
<b>since you're a regular.</b>

181
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:14,684
<b>Is she your new girl?</b>

182
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:19,524
<b>She's not my girl.</b>

183
00:18:20,464 --> 00:18:22,365
<b>She's being nice because I spend a lot here.</b>

184
00:18:22,494 --> 00:18:23,665
<b>You already slept with her.</b>

185
00:18:26,865 --> 00:18:28,305
<b>I did not.</b>

186
00:18:30,805 --> 00:18:32,274
<b>Drop the small talk.</b>

187
00:18:33,974 --> 00:18:35,415
<b>Tell me about your business.</b>

188
00:18:36,714 --> 00:18:38,885
<b>Is the movie set construction going well?</b>

189
00:18:39,744 --> 00:18:41,345
<b>I'll invite you to the groundbreaking.</b>

190
00:18:43,855 --> 00:18:45,984
<b>You've succeeded, Tae Oh.</b>

191
00:18:49,355 --> 00:18:50,754
<b>You still have...</b>

192
00:18:51,865 --> 00:18:53,364
<b>an insecurity complex toward me.</b>

193
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:54,524
<b>Naturally, I envy you.</b>

194
00:18:54,694 --> 00:18:57,065
<b>It takes skills to live off of a woman.</b>

195
00:19:44,444 --> 00:19:45,484
<b>Welcome.</b>

196
00:19:54,224 --> 00:19:55,224
<b>So?</b>

197
00:19:56,694 --> 00:19:59,794
<b>Was it nice sleeping with my wife?</b>

198
00:20:02,764 --> 00:20:04,165
<b>How was Ji Sun Woo?</b>

199
00:20:07,204 --> 00:20:08,905
<b>She's pretty nice, right?</b>

200
00:20:09,274 --> 00:20:11,504
<b>Why are you curious?</b>

201
00:20:13,544 --> 00:20:15,244
<b>She's not your wife anymore.</b>

202
00:20:22,284 --> 00:20:24,355
<b>Be straightforward with me...</b>

203
00:20:24,915 --> 00:20:26,454
<b>and stop beating around the bush.</b>

204
00:20:30,294 --> 00:20:31,494
<b>Ji Sun Woo...</b>

205
00:20:32,665 --> 00:20:35,794
<b>is really cool. She's wild.</b>

206
00:20:41,165 --> 00:20:42,405
<b>Jerk.</b>

207
00:20:47,944 --> 00:20:49,744
<b>She likes taking the lead.</b>

208
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:55,814
<b>- You know it too, don't you?
- You're a jerk.</b>

209
00:20:55,815 --> 00:20:58,655
<b>I'm better than the jerk who deserted his wife and son.</b>

210
00:20:59,454 --> 00:21:00,555
<b>Am I wrong?</b>

211
00:21:08,494 --> 00:21:09,534
<b>My goodness.</b>

212
00:21:10,635 --> 00:21:12,934
<b>Did I say something wrong?</b>

213
00:21:14,534 --> 00:21:15,635
<b>What do we do?</b>

214
00:21:17,774 --> 00:21:18,805
<b>Call the manager!</b>

215
00:21:19,504 --> 00:21:21,575
<b>Over here. There's a fight.</b>

216
00:21:22,544 --> 00:21:24,675
<b>Why did you ask, then?</b>

217
00:21:26,484 --> 00:21:28,655
<b>You're a jerk.</b>

218
00:21:28,714 --> 00:21:30,155
<b>Let go of me.</b>

219
00:21:34,254 --> 00:21:35,595
<b>What do we do?</b>

220
00:21:36,524 --> 00:21:38,294
<b>- You punk!
- Let go of me!</b>

221
00:21:41,325 --> 00:21:42,865
<b>I'm not done with you.</b>

222
00:21:43,234 --> 00:21:45,605
<b>- Let go.
- Please stop.</b>

223
00:21:45,704 --> 00:21:48,874
<b>Hey. Come here, jerk!</b>

224
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:50,074
<b>- Hey!
- Bring it.</b>

225
00:21:50,075 --> 00:21:51,845
<b>Let me go, punk.</b>

226
00:21:56,974 --> 00:21:58,885
<b>Let go. Let go.</b>

227
00:22:06,754 --> 00:22:08,994
<b>- Let go.
- You let go first.</b>

228
00:22:14,365 --> 00:22:16,964
<b>Why did you drink so much?</b>

229
00:22:21,034 --> 00:22:22,635
<b>Did you drink with your staff?</b>

230
00:22:27,544 --> 00:22:29,744
<b>What happened? Did you get hurt?</b>

231
00:22:30,815 --> 00:22:32,014
<b>Did you get in a fight?</b>

232
00:22:32,615 --> 00:22:33,984
<b>I met Tae Oh.</b>

233
00:22:39,784 --> 00:22:41,954
<b>We ran into each other by chance.</b>

234
00:22:46,095 --> 00:22:47,125
<b>Hold on.</b>

235
00:23:04,145 --> 00:23:05,385
<b>Drink this first.</b>

236
00:23:10,954 --> 00:23:12,355
<b>I'll bring some ointment.</b>

237
00:23:24,734 --> 00:23:26,665
<b>Are you happy with your wife?</b>

238
00:23:29,774 --> 00:23:31,034
<b>You should be good to her.</b>

239
00:23:33,875 --> 00:23:36,744
<b>Getting a divorce isn't worth it.</b>

240
00:23:40,415 --> 00:23:42,155
<b>You became big thanks to getting a divorce.</b>

241
00:23:42,555 --> 00:23:44,085
<b>That's different.</b>

242
00:23:44,585 --> 00:23:46,925
<b>Your wife is nice enough to put up with you.</b>

243
00:23:48,555 --> 00:23:49,855
<b>You're so selfish.</b>

244
00:23:51,325 --> 00:23:53,224
<b>You won't be so young forever.</b>

245
00:23:54,724 --> 00:23:57,095
<b>You should change your mind before it's too late.</b>

246
00:23:59,165 --> 00:24:00,405
<b>As one gets older,</b>

247
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:03,605
<b>the only thing that's left...</b>

248
00:24:05,645 --> 00:24:07,175
<b>are children.</b>

249
00:24:35,734 --> 00:24:37,305
<b>Should we have a baby?</b>

250
00:24:51,214 --> 00:24:52,254
<b>But...</b>

251
00:24:53,855 --> 00:24:56,595
<b>it might only get tougher for you once we have a baby.</b>

252
00:24:58,355 --> 00:25:00,224
<b>I'm a selfish guy, you know.</b>

253
00:25:41,365 --> 00:25:43,405
<b>Jenny, are you going downstairs?</b>

254
00:25:44,234 --> 00:25:45,744
<b>Be careful. That's it.</b>

255
00:25:46,774 --> 00:25:47,944
<b>That's it.</b>

256
00:26:02,954 --> 00:26:04,554
<b>Did you check the validity of the requests...</b>

257
00:26:04,555 --> 00:26:06,723
<b>for equipment order per department?</b>

258
00:26:06,724 --> 00:26:07,794
<b>Yes, ma'am.</b>

259
00:26:08,425 --> 00:26:11,434
<b>Please take good care of the public bidding,</b>

260
00:26:11,534 --> 00:26:14,203
<b>especially with writing the private contract.</b>

261
00:26:14,204 --> 00:26:16,175
<b>Make sure it goes smoothly without any problems.</b>

262
00:26:16,335 --> 00:26:17,415
<b>- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.</b>

263
00:26:19,204 --> 00:26:22,244
<b>OBGYN's success rate for treating infertility is high.</b>

264
00:26:23,375 --> 00:26:25,915
<b>I think the word got out.</b>

265
00:26:26,815 --> 00:26:28,315
<b>I've been getting more patients.</b>

266
00:26:29,155 --> 00:26:30,855
<b>You have more complaints as well.</b>

267
00:26:32,855 --> 00:26:35,015
<b>You know how smart our patients are these days, right?</b>

268
00:26:36,325 --> 00:26:38,925
<b>Many people complained about overtreatments and overuse...</b>

269
00:26:39,395 --> 00:26:41,065
<b>of machines related to OBGYN.</b>

270
00:26:44,534 --> 00:26:47,165
<b>- I'm not like that.
- I know.</b>

271
00:26:48,504 --> 00:26:51,175
<b>Let's be careful so that we're not misunderstood.</b>

272
00:26:51,905 --> 00:26:52,985
<b>- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.</b>

273
00:26:53,974 --> 00:26:55,845
<b>Let's end the meeting here, sir.</b>

274
00:26:56,714 --> 00:26:57,744
<b>Shall we?</b>

275
00:26:58,444 --> 00:27:00,714
<b>- Good job.
- Thank you.</b>

276
00:27:08,284 --> 00:27:09,325
<b>Right.</b>

277
00:27:10,024 --> 00:27:12,024
<b>Does Joon Young still come in for consultations?</b>

278
00:27:21,405 --> 00:27:24,234
<b>I don't think this is the place to talk about family matters.</b>

279
00:27:42,524 --> 00:27:43,954
<b>What happened?</b>

280
00:27:44,994 --> 00:27:47,595
<b>Dr. Kong hasn't made a move yet.</b>

281
00:27:47,764 --> 00:27:49,794
<b>I'm on my way after getting the confirmation.</b>

282
00:27:52,034 --> 00:27:53,105
<b>I know.</b>

283
00:27:53,704 --> 00:27:56,375
<b>Matters like this should be resolved without delay.</b>

284
00:27:59,744 --> 00:28:01,944
<b>Getting rid of one person will resolve everything.</b>

285
00:28:02,244 --> 00:28:04,274
<b>There's no need to cause headaches.</b>

286
00:28:04,774 --> 00:28:07,544
<b>Things that need to be cut off and resolved, should be done fast.</b>

287
00:28:18,355 --> 00:28:21,425
<b>What is your decision regarding the hospital's associate director?</b>

288
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:24,294
<b>I was about to contact you on that matter as well.</b>

289
00:28:24,595 --> 00:28:28,264
<b>Actually, I'm scheduled to meet Chairman Yeo separately tonight.</b>

290
00:28:30,474 --> 00:28:31,734
<b>What do you mean,</b>

291
00:28:32,905 --> 00:28:34,644
<b>- "separately"?
- Dr. Ji...</b>

292
00:28:34,645 --> 00:28:37,714
<b>requested that I do that.</b>

293
00:28:42,355 --> 00:28:43,815
<b>You're going to meet Chairman Yeo?</b>

294
00:28:44,915 --> 00:28:45,925
<b>Yes.</b>

295
00:28:47,454 --> 00:28:49,754
<b>I'll meet him to settle everything.</b>

296
00:28:50,155 --> 00:28:51,425
<b>Let me tell you now...</b>

297
00:28:51,994 --> 00:28:54,994
<b>that I don't plan on giving up on the donation. Okay?</b>

298
00:28:56,335 --> 00:28:58,794
<b>- I know.
- Will you be able to do it?</b>

299
00:28:59,234 --> 00:29:00,464
<b>As long as you don't...</b>

300
00:29:01,034 --> 00:29:04,135
<b>wish to push me off from the associate director position.</b>

301
00:29:04,274 --> 00:29:05,605
<b>What are you saying?</b>

302
00:29:06,204 --> 00:29:08,875
<b>Of course, I'd prefer you over Dr. Sul.</b>

303
00:29:09,145 --> 00:29:10,874
<b>You have the most patients,</b>

304
00:29:10,875 --> 00:29:15,044
<b>and you're so organized with our administrative work.</b>

305
00:29:15,412 --> 00:29:16,753
<b>If you receive the donation...</b>

306
00:29:16,754 --> 00:29:18,561
<b>and manage to avoid getting dismissed at the same time,</b>

307
00:29:18,585 --> 00:29:19,925
<b>I'd be more than satisfied.</b>

308
00:29:20,625 --> 00:29:22,224
<b>I'll try my best to make it happen.</b>

309
00:29:22,524 --> 00:29:24,855
<b>You never disappoint me.</b>

310
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:28,665
<b>I've been struggling so much with that issue.</b>

311
00:29:30,234 --> 00:29:33,905
<b>I'll set up an appointment with Chairman Yeo.</b>

312
00:29:44,474 --> 00:29:46,885
<b>Do you think you'll be able to change anything?</b>

313
00:29:53,454 --> 00:29:55,453
<b>I'm expecting a patient in five minutes.</b>

314
00:29:55,454 --> 00:29:57,595
<b>Do you think I'm the only one...</b>

<b>What about that?</b>

338

<b>Why do you want to be friends with me?</b>

346
00:33:09,819 --> 00:33:11,290
<b>Do you want us to meet up...</b>

347
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:14,290
<b>so we could badmouth Sun Woo behind her back?</b>

348
00:33:20,299 --> 00:33:21,460
<b>Why did she...</b>

349
00:33:23,299 --> 00:33:24,669
<b>join the women's association?</b>

350

<b>You voted against her.</b>

351
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:32,609
<b>And I'm hoping you know why she decided to join.</b>

352
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,279

353
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:41,279

354

<b>I know it was hard to come here, so I'll be honest with you.</b>

355

<b>You see,</b>

356
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:56,330
<b>I hate Tae Oh way more than I hate you.</b>

357
00:33:57,270 --> 00:34:01,040
<b>I even told my husband not to be friends with him.</b>

358
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:04,040
<b>I no longer want to get involved...</b>

361

368

<b>Do you think someone took it?</b>

370

- No.</b>

<b>- Look for it again.
- Gosh, this is so annoying.</b>

00:47:54,270 --> 00:47:55,270
<b>Joon Young.</b>

473
00:48:43,649 --> 00:48:44,790
<b>Hello?</b>

474
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:46,290
<b>Did you find Joon Young?</b>

475
00:48:47,290 --> 00:48:48,359
<b>Where are you right now?</b>

476
00:49:21,319 --> 00:49:22,460
<b>Joon Young!</b>

477
00:49:23,589 --> 00:49:24,730
<b>Lee Joon Young!</b>

478
00:49:34,969 --> 00:49:36,100
<b>Haven't you found him yet?</b>

479
00:49:36,609 --> 00:49:39,239
<b>If anything touched a hair on Joon Young,</b>

480
00:49:39,669 --> 00:49:41,080
<b>I'll kill you with my hands!</b>

481
00:49:42,239 --> 00:49:43,480
<b>What are you saying?</b>

482
00:49:49,719 --> 00:49:50,819
<b>Hello?</b>

483
00:49:53,189 --> 00:49:54,960
<b>- Did you find him?
- Is it the police?</b>

484
00:49:55,259 --> 00:49:56,460
<b>Where?</b>

485
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:00,660
<b>(Chairman Yeo)</b>

486
00:50:07,799 --> 00:50:09,540
<b>(Chairman Yeo)</b>

487
00:50:19,149 --> 00:50:20,580
<b>(Cancel)</b>

488
00:50:24,890 --> 00:50:26,020
<b>Please leave a message...</b>

489
00:50:42,169 --> 00:50:43,870
<b>You should've told your parents.</b>

490
00:50:49,939 --> 00:50:51,049
<b>Hello.</b>

491
00:50:52,950 --> 00:50:54,020
<b>Are you okay?</b>

492
00:50:54,719 --> 00:50:56,989
<b>Are you hurt?</b>

493
00:50:57,390 --> 00:50:58,489
<b>No, right?</b>

494
00:50:59,290 --> 00:51:01,890
<b>He says he came here because he didn't want to go to the academy.</b>

495
00:51:05,689 --> 00:51:09,359
<b>- Thank you. Thank you so much.
- Bye. Let's go.</b>

496
00:51:22,410 --> 00:51:23,680
<b>What happened?</b>

497
00:51:24,210 --> 00:51:26,755
<b>Is it true you skipped your lesson because you didn't want to go?</b>

498
00:51:26,779 --> 00:51:27,979
<b>Why is your phone turned off?</b>

499
00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:29,750
<b>I did what I did because I wanted to.</b>

500
00:51:31,189 --> 00:51:33,319
<b>- What?
- Can't I skip a class for once?</b>

501
00:51:33,620 --> 00:51:35,460
<b>Does it deserve all this fuss?</b>

502
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:37,160
<b>What's the matter with you?</b>

503
00:51:42,799 --> 00:51:43,930
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

504
00:52:10,430 --> 00:52:11,589
<b>Dr. Ji.</b>

505
00:52:19,129 --> 00:52:20,239
<b>Joon Young.</b>

506
00:52:57,339 --> 00:52:58,569
<b>Did you eat dinner?</b>

507
00:53:11,319 --> 00:53:13,790
<b>It looks like tonight won't work.</b>

508
00:53:14,319 --> 00:53:15,560
<b>Let's eat another time.</b>

509
00:53:15,919 --> 00:53:18,960
<b>Since I'm here in person, let me say something.</b>

510
00:53:20,730 --> 00:53:22,899
<b>I'm very thankful for the donation,</b>

511
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:24,899
<b>but it's painstaking for us.</b>

512
00:53:25,270 --> 00:53:28,500
<b>To be honest, Dr. Sul isn't an associate director material.</b>

513
00:53:29,169 --> 00:53:32,669
<b>If you could please reconsider...</b>

514
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:36,640
<b>You have many great doctors at your hospital.</b>

515
00:53:36,910 --> 00:53:39,049
<b>Yes, we do.</b>

516
00:53:39,649 --> 00:53:42,919
<b>But not everyone can handle the associate director role.</b>

517
00:53:44,950 --> 00:53:48,089
<b>The psychiatrist from Seoul...</b>

518
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:50,390
<b>has a good reputation, doesn't he?</b>

519
00:54:00,169 --> 00:54:02,500
<b>Forget it. I have nothing to say to you.</b>

520
00:54:02,839 --> 00:54:03,910
<b>Joon Young.</b>

521
00:54:11,950 --> 00:54:14,849
<b>Joon Young, please listen to me.</b>

522
00:54:14,850 --> 00:54:17,120
<b>Please just leave me alone!</b>

523
00:54:17,620 --> 00:54:19,419
<b>Why are you acting like this?</b>

524
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:21,818
<b>Do you think you're in the right?</b>

525
00:54:21,819 --> 00:54:23,520
<b>I said, I don't want to talk to you.</b>

526
00:54:23,759 --> 00:54:26,759
<b>What kind of mom would call the police for skipping a lesson?</b>

527
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:28,898
<b>I couldn't reach you and I didn't know where you were.</b>

528
00:54:28,899 --> 00:54:30,000
<b>Of course, I was worried.</b>

529
00:54:31,469 --> 00:54:32,930
<b>Open the door right now!</b>

530
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:35,770
<b>- Joon Young!
- I'll talk to him.</b>

531
00:54:39,609 --> 00:54:41,910
<b>Getting worked up like this won't do any good.</b>

532
00:54:42,009 --> 00:54:43,109
<b>Leave it to me.</b>

533
00:54:49,450 --> 00:54:50,890
<b>Joon Young, will you talk with me?</b>

534
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:57,089
<b>You should go downstairs.</b>

535
00:55:09,870 --> 00:55:13,339
<b>You seem really upset, so I think you feel wronged.</b>

536
00:55:18,279 --> 00:55:19,810
<b>What made you so upset?</b>

537
00:55:20,549 --> 00:55:22,049
<b>What do you dislike the most?</b>

538
00:55:23,180 --> 00:55:27,020
<b>Let's try to organize the negative feelings you have.</b>

539
00:55:27,620 --> 00:55:29,960
<b>I'll wait until you feel calm.</b>

540
00:55:33,430 --> 00:55:36,899
<b>You can talk to me after that. Man to man.</b>

541
00:56:46,899 --> 00:56:48,640
<b>I think he had a fight with his friends.</b>

542
00:56:49,270 --> 00:56:52,310
<b>It's nothing to worry about, so you can relax.</b>

543
00:56:53,839 --> 00:56:56,180
<b>He's sorry he took it out on you.</b>

544
00:57:06,020 --> 00:57:08,319
<b>Why don't you reduce your hours at the hospital?</b>

545
00:57:10,790 --> 00:57:12,670
<b>How can an associate director reduce her hours?</b>

546
00:57:13,089 --> 00:57:15,029
<b>Don't you know what'll happen to the hospital?</b>

547
00:57:15,399 --> 00:57:17,500
<b>It's an important time for Joon Young.</b>

548
00:57:18,370 --> 00:57:20,298
<b>I think it'd be better to spend more time with him,</b>

549
00:57:20,299 --> 00:57:21,779
<b>even if it's just for the time being.</b>

550
00:57:22,140 --> 00:57:24,370
<b>Isn't that more important than your position?</b>

551
00:57:29,009 --> 00:57:31,250
<b>I have to fill his dad's role too.</b>

552
00:57:33,710 --> 00:57:35,520
<b>If I want to provide the best for him,</b>

553
00:57:36,719 --> 00:57:38,520
<b>I can't give up on my work.</b>

554
00:57:38,750 --> 00:57:39,850
<b>In the end,</b>

555
00:57:40,759 --> 00:57:42,619
<b>you need to pick between...</b>

556
00:57:42,620 --> 00:57:44,188
<b>caring for his emotions or providing material things.</b>

557
00:57:44,189 --> 00:57:45,890
<b>You'd be greedy to want to do both.</b>

558
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:49,528
<b>Are you telling me to admit...</b>

559
00:57:49,529 --> 00:57:51,289
<b>I'm insufficient because I'm a divorced mom?</b>

560
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,339
<b>Even moms who didn't divorce aren't perfect.</b>

561
00:57:59,370 --> 00:58:00,839
<b>You wouldn't know.</b>

562
00:58:03,239 --> 00:58:04,410
<b>You're not a parent.</b>

563
00:58:12,632 --> 00:58:14,952
<b>I just want to see Joon Young. What's the matter with you?</b>

564
00:58:17,190 --> 00:58:18,521
<b>You don't deserve to see him.</b>

565
00:58:19,096 --> 00:58:21,565
<b>How could you be so brazen?</b>

566
00:58:21,590 --> 00:58:23,360
<b>Why do you keep blaming it on me?</b>

567
00:58:23,831 --> 00:58:25,671
<b>It's not my fault that you couldn't reach him.</b>

568
00:58:26,971 --> 00:58:28,030
<b>It's him.</b>

569
00:58:29,471 --> 00:58:30,740
<b>Park In Kyu.</b>

570
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:35,939
<b>- What are you saying?
- I'm not acting this way...</b>

571
00:58:35,940 --> 00:58:37,580
<b>just because I couldn't reach Joon Young.</b>

572
00:58:38,510 --> 00:58:39,710
<b>Someone sent me a dead bird...</b>

573
00:58:40,681 --> 00:58:42,681
<b>and a photo of Joon Young with a bloodstain on it.</b>

574
00:58:42,951 --> 00:58:46,621
<b>That jerk blackmailed me and even followed Joon Young.</b>

575
00:58:48,621 --> 00:58:49,690
<b>Are you sure?</b>

576
00:58:51,521 --> 00:58:53,190
<b>I saw him where we found Joon Young.</b>

577
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:56,630
<b>I saw his face. I remember it very clearly.</b>

578
00:59:01,701 --> 00:59:02,771
<b>It was you, wasn't it?</b>

579
00:59:04,632 --> 00:59:06,302
<b>You got him involved in this, didn't you?</b>

580
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:09,541
<b>You made him threaten me...</b>

581
00:59:10,981 --> 00:59:12,709
<b>and even asked him to mess with our son?</b>

582
00:59:12,710 --> 00:59:14,050
<b>Cut the nonsense.</b>

583
00:59:14,780 --> 00:59:16,210
<b>Why would I do something like that?</b>

584
00:59:17,251 --> 00:59:19,376
<b>That's a question you should ask yourself.</b>

585
00:59:21,751 --> 00:59:23,423
<b>Why are you doing this? Why?</b>

586
00:59:23,820 --> 00:59:26,420
<b>What do you gain by making me suffer like this?</b>

587
00:59:28,231 --> 00:59:29,260
<b>It wasn't me.</b>

588
00:59:30,190 --> 00:59:31,231
<b>I swear.</b>

589
00:59:31,731 --> 00:59:34,371
<b>Don't you dare tell me that you didn't know...</b>

590
00:59:34,871 --> 00:59:36,331
<b>this might put Joon Young in danger.</b>

591
00:59:37,041 --> 00:59:39,271
<b>If that jerk approaches us one more time,</b>

592
00:59:40,995 --> 00:59:42,694
<b>I swear I won't stay still.</b>

593
01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:35,291
<b>I'll go on my own.</b>

594
01:00:35,690 --> 01:00:37,490
<b>It's the second drawer underneath this table.</b>

595
01:00:52,081 --> 01:00:53,811
<b>(Locked)</b>

596
01:00:54,481 --> 01:00:56,110
<b>The door is unlocked.</b>

<b>Your husband...</b>

<b>(Ji Sun Woo)</b>

<b>- Hello?
- Park In Kyu.</b>

603

<b>It's him, isn't it?</b>

604

<b>I'm not sure. I couldn't see his face properly.</b>

<b>You know he got discharged from prison, right?</b>

606

<b>Hasn't he ever visited you?</b>

607

<b>No, he probably doesn't even know where I live.</b>

608

<b>He came to see me.</b>

609

<b>He blackmailed me, too.</b>

610

<b>He might visit you as well.</b>

611

<b>Why don't you get away for a while?</b>

612

<b>I told you already. He won't be able to find me.</b>

<b>In Kyu and I broke up ages ago.</b>

01:05:43,030 --> 01:05:44,570
<b>I never resented you.</b>

629
01:05:46,871 --> 01:05:48,210
<b>I just missed you a lot.</b>

630
01:05:51,981 --> 01:05:52,981
<b>Hyun Seo.</b>

631
01:05:55,110 --> 01:05:56,510
<b>Didn't you miss me?</b>

632
01:05:59,820 --> 01:06:02,721
<b>I was worried about you. And I also felt sorry.</b>

633
01:06:07,530 --> 01:06:08,530
<b>Can we...</b>

634
01:06:09,690 --> 01:06:11,101
<b>start over again?</b>

635
01:06:12,460 --> 01:06:14,130
<b>I promise I'll be good this time.</b>

636
01:06:15,630 --> 01:06:17,741
<b>I'm different now. I've changed a lot.</b>

637
01:06:19,771 --> 01:06:20,971
<b>I won't give you a hard time.</b>

638
01:06:21,811 --> 01:06:22,870
<b>I swear.</b>

639
01:06:27,910 --> 01:06:29,010
<b>Do you really think...</b>

640
01:06:31,250 --> 01:06:32,781
<b>we still have a future?</b>

641
01:07:00,781 --> 01:07:02,010
<b>You have the guts to smile?</b>

642
01:07:02,611 --> 01:07:04,120
<b>Who told you to mess with my son?</b>

643
01:07:04,550 --> 01:07:05,681
<b>Are you crazy?</b>

644
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:07,550
<b>You're being a bit too harsh.</b>

645
01:07:08,790 --> 01:07:09,991
<b>I didn't do anything to him.</b>

646
01:07:13,120 --> 01:07:14,160
<b>Yet.</b>

647
01:07:14,330 --> 01:07:15,491
<b>"Yet"?</b>

648
01:07:16,491 --> 01:07:19,101
<b>- "Yet"?
- The cops know my face.</b>

649
01:07:20,561 --> 01:07:22,401
<b>You can't turn your back on me.</b>

650
01:07:23,271 --> 01:07:25,200
<b>So pay me what you owe me.</b>

651
01:07:26,101 --> 01:07:27,370
<b>Don't make me mad.</b>

652
01:07:27,571 --> 01:07:28,971
<b>You stupid idiot.</b>

653
01:07:29,818 --> 01:07:31,558
<b>You should've known...</b>

654
01:07:32,111 --> 01:07:34,410
<b>that the instant you touch my son, the deal is off.</b>

655
01:07:35,481 --> 01:07:38,080
<b>Don't come near me or my son again.</b>

656
01:07:38,550 --> 01:07:39,681
<b>Got that?</b>

657
01:07:40,181 --> 01:07:41,691
<b>Are you trying to pull out now?</b>

658
01:07:43,391 --> 01:07:45,221
<b>You're the one who broke your promise first.</b>

659
01:07:46,620 --> 01:07:47,959
<b>How dare you threaten me?</b>

660
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:50,090
<b>I've been in jail once. I don't mind going again.</b>

661
01:07:51,460 --> 01:07:54,231
<b>I have nothing to lose. Maybe I'll tell the cops everything.</b>

662
01:07:54,401 --> 01:07:55,531
<b>That should be fun.</b>

663
01:07:56,830 --> 01:07:58,500
<b>A famous movie producer...</b>

664
01:07:58,700 --> 01:08:01,540
<b>hires someone to assault his ex-wife. The media will love it.</b>

665
01:08:07,981 --> 01:08:09,181
<b>Listen, Lee Tae Oh.</b>

666
01:08:11,050 --> 01:08:13,550
<b>I haven't even begun to threaten you for real yet.</b>

667
01:08:13,781 --> 01:08:15,450
<b>I want double the amount...</b>

668
01:08:17,021 --> 01:08:18,361
<b>you promised.</b>

669
01:08:20,021 --> 01:08:22,231
<b>That's the only way our transaction will be completed.</b>

670
01:08:30,130 --> 01:08:31,500
<b>Remember. Double.</b>

671
01:09:35,031 --> 01:09:36,130
<b>Honey.</b>

672
01:09:37,700 --> 01:09:38,800
<b>Da Kyung.</b>

673
01:09:58,721 --> 01:09:59,921
<b>Where did you go at this hour?</b>

674
01:10:02,491 --> 01:10:03,590
<b>Da Kyung.</b>

675
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:11,401
<b>Come out quietly.</b>

676
01:10:11,971 --> 01:10:13,101
<b>You'll wake Jenny.</b>

677
01:10:28,651 --> 01:10:29,821
<b>Is something wrong?</b>

678
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:33,061
<b>I met a friend.</b>

679
01:10:37,491 --> 01:10:38,601
<b>What about you?</b>

680
01:10:39,700 --> 01:10:41,000
<b>Why were you late?</b>

681
01:10:43,630 --> 01:10:45,271
<b>Something came up with Joon Young.</b>

682
01:10:49,971 --> 01:10:51,080
<b>Joon Young.</b>

683
01:10:55,210 --> 01:10:56,651
<b>What was it this time?</b>

684
01:10:59,620 --> 01:11:00,750
<b>It was nothing much.</b>

685
01:11:05,420 --> 01:11:06,991
<b>Is there a problem with him?</b>

686
01:11:07,960 --> 01:11:09,789
<b>Or can his mom not control him by herself?</b>

687
01:11:09,790 --> 01:11:11,061
<b>He doesn't have problems.</b>

688
01:11:12,061 --> 01:11:13,100
<b>Don't say it like that.</b>

689
01:11:13,101 --> 01:11:15,199
<b>Then why do you rush over every time something happens?</b>

690
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:16,530
<b>Why do you care so much about that family?</b>

691
01:11:16,531 --> 01:11:18,000
<b>Do you miss her that much?</b>

692
01:11:23,670 --> 01:11:26,580
<b>I'm trying to get rid of her from our lives.</b>

693
01:11:27,540 --> 01:11:29,460
<b>You can ask your father if you don't believe me.</b>

694
01:11:32,281 --> 01:11:33,380
<b>How much...</b>

695
01:11:34,721 --> 01:11:35,891
<b>do you trust your husband?</b>

696
01:11:47,031 --> 01:11:48,200
<b>How much...</b>

697
01:11:49,471 --> 01:11:50,700
<b>do you trust your husband?</b>

698
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:01,210
<b>I'll trust you.</b>

699
01:12:07,721 --> 01:12:08,851
<b>I trust...</b>

700
01:12:10,351 --> 01:12:11,521
<b>you.</b>

701
01:12:15,790 --> 01:12:17,290
<b>I'm terribly sorry, Father.</b>

702
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:19,531
<b>Something unexpected happened.</b>

703
01:12:20,731 --> 01:12:22,471
<b>I couldn't reach my son,</b>

704
01:12:22,971 --> 01:12:25,271
<b>so I panicked, thinking something bad had happened.</b>

705
01:12:26,340 --> 01:12:28,170
<b>He had never done that before.</b>

706
01:12:29,710 --> 01:12:33,281
<b>I was too out of it and didn't realize you had called.</b>

707
01:12:33,580 --> 01:12:35,050
<b>As long as everything's fine.</b>

708
01:12:36,651 --> 01:12:38,681
<b>You don't have to explain yourself to me.</b>

709
01:12:40,221 --> 01:12:43,290
<b>What should we do about the associate director matter?</b>

710
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:46,321
<b>I'll think about it.</b>

711
01:12:48,361 --> 01:12:49,790
<b>Aren't you going to work?</b>

712
01:12:50,290 --> 01:12:51,601
<b>I have matters to tend to.</b>

713
01:12:53,061 --> 01:12:54,160
<b>Yes, sir.</b>

714
01:13:04,271 --> 01:13:06,410
<b>You must have been scared.</b>

715
01:13:07,040 --> 01:13:09,811
<b>All children do that at least once.</b>

716
01:13:10,111 --> 01:13:13,380
<b>Our kids were a huge headache when they went through puberty.</b>

717
01:13:13,721 --> 01:13:15,450
<b>I know how you feel.</b>

718
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:18,290
<b>I apologize.</b>

719
01:13:19,021 --> 01:13:23,330
<b>I won't harm the hospital due to family matters again.</b>

720
01:13:24,361 --> 01:13:26,031
<b>That's easier said than done.</b>

721
01:13:27,500 --> 01:13:30,571
<b>You didn't know he was getting therapy for six months.</b>

722
01:13:31,130 --> 01:13:33,641
<b>This is why a son needs his father.</b>

723
01:13:34,071 --> 01:13:37,510
<b>But it's not like you can get help from Mr. Lee.</b>

724
01:13:38,910 --> 01:13:41,281
<b>I've been too consumed with the hospital.</b>

725
01:13:41,550 --> 01:13:44,450
<b>I've been too inattentive about your situation.</b>

726
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:47,320
<b>Don't overdo it. Tend to your son first.</b>

727
01:13:47,321 --> 01:13:48,550
<b>Children come first.</b>

728
01:13:48,721 --> 01:13:51,321
<b>I'm sure you're upset and this and that.</b>

729
01:13:51,420 --> 01:13:53,260
<b>Even if Dr. Kim does help,</b>

730
01:13:54,160 --> 01:13:55,731
<b>he can't replace his father.</b>

731
01:13:57,391 --> 01:13:59,931
<b>This is why a woman can't do it on her own.</b>

732
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:01,431
<b>Am I wrong?</b>

733
01:14:03,401 --> 01:14:05,340
<b>I said not to talk about my family.</b>

734
01:14:05,500 --> 01:14:08,271
<b>If you want my title, you should play fair and use your skills.</b>

735
01:14:08,771 --> 01:14:10,170
<b>Isn't that a bit low?</b>

736
01:14:11,481 --> 01:14:14,111
<b>Am I the only one who knows that Joon Young...</b>

737
01:14:14,510 --> 01:14:15,981
<b>is seeing Dr. Kim?</b>

738
01:14:16,410 --> 01:14:18,580
<b>Why don't you ever suspect Kim Yoon Ki?</b>

739
01:14:18,721 --> 01:14:20,720
<b>Why is he treating your son of all people...</b>

740
01:14:20,721 --> 01:14:22,090
<b>without telling you?</b>

741
01:14:22,351 --> 01:14:23,891
<b>Don't you think it's weird?</b>

742
01:14:26,521 --> 01:14:28,760
<b>Stop hurting my feelings, Sun Woo.</b>

743
01:14:29,191 --> 01:14:31,460
<b>I may be...</b>

744
01:14:31,830 --> 01:14:36,170
<b>your only ally in this all of Gosan.</b>

745
01:14:37,330 --> 01:14:40,601
<b>It may be better to spend more time with your son for the time being.</b>

746
01:14:41,271 --> 01:14:43,671
<b>Isn't that more important than being the associate director?</b>

747
01:14:45,540 --> 01:14:48,351
<b>Do you know Chairman Yeo Byung Kyu well?</b>

748
01:14:48,910 --> 01:14:51,450
<b>Who in Gosan doesn't know Chairman Yeo?</b>

749
01:14:51,580 --> 01:14:54,049
<b>I've been here for two years. Of course, I know him.</b>

750
01:14:54,050 --> 01:14:56,021
<b>That's not what I mean.</b>

751
01:14:56,221 --> 01:14:59,160
<b>I'm asking if you know him on a personal level.</b>

752
01:14:59,561 --> 01:15:02,160
<b>No. I've never seen him outside of a professional setting.</b>

753
01:15:02,991 --> 01:15:05,061
<b>Why do you ask? Is something wrong?</b>

754
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:07,160
<b>No. Work hard.</b>

755
01:15:07,460 --> 01:15:08,571
<b>Yes, sir.</b>

756
01:15:13,101 --> 01:15:14,370
<b>- Hello.
- Hello.</b>

757
01:15:33,790 --> 01:15:35,891
<b>Did you talk to Joon Young?</b>

758
01:15:37,531 --> 01:15:39,830
<b>How are you so good with him?</b>

759
01:15:40,500 --> 01:15:41,700
<b>That's my specialty.</b>

760
01:15:45,971 --> 01:15:49,311
<b>How did you end up treating my son?</b>

761
01:15:53,941 --> 01:15:55,050
<b>Actually,</b>

762
01:15:57,010 --> 01:15:59,721
<b>there's a secret I haven't told you.</b>

763
01:16:01,950 --> 01:16:03,420
<b>When I was Joon Young's age,</b>

764
01:16:04,521 --> 01:16:06,790
<b>I was a real troublemaker.</b>

765
01:16:06,991 --> 01:16:09,590
<b>I used to steal things and run away from home.</b>

766
01:16:09,960 --> 01:16:13,601
<b>Although I got past it and went to med school later.</b>

767
01:16:20,340 --> 01:16:22,811
<b>I saw Joon Young one day on the street,</b>

768
01:16:24,141 --> 01:16:25,641
<b>and I could tell at a glance.</b>

769
01:16:28,981 --> 01:16:30,681
<b>He's very anxious.</b>

770
01:16:32,620 --> 01:16:34,080
<b>I should talk to him.</b>

771
01:16:35,721 --> 01:16:37,120
<b>That's why I held onto him.</b>

772
01:16:41,660 --> 01:16:44,130
<b>So you're saying you didn't end up treating him...</b>

773
01:16:46,401 --> 01:16:48,130
<b>because he's my son.</b>

774
01:16:48,731 --> 01:16:49,870
<b>Not at all.</b>

775
01:17:07,420 --> 01:17:09,850
<b>- Are you kidding me?
- I gave you what I promised.</b>

776
01:17:09,851 --> 01:17:11,920
<b>I clearly said I wanted double.</b>

777
01:17:12,691 --> 01:17:13,721
<b>I was very clear.</b>

778
01:17:16,160 --> 01:17:18,640
<b>Do you take me for a joke because I bothered to deal with you?</b>

779
01:17:19,901 --> 01:17:22,000
<b>Just give me the phone you used to call me.</b>

780
01:17:24,500 --> 01:17:26,200
<b>It's over between us starting today.</b>

781
01:17:26,641 --> 01:17:28,141
<b>You're going to need me.</b>

782
01:17:30,670 --> 01:17:33,680
<b>You didn't even get to do half of what you wanted.</b>

783
01:17:33,681 --> 01:17:35,811
<b>- What nonsense are you saying?
- That woman.</b>

784
01:17:38,010 --> 01:17:39,120
<b>I know you want her.</b>

785
01:17:40,521 --> 01:17:41,521
<b>Am I wrong?</b>

786
01:17:47,061 --> 01:17:49,061
<b>You hate her enough to want to kill her,</b>

787
01:17:50,031 --> 01:17:51,791
<b>but you don't want someone else to have her.</b>

788
01:17:53,460 --> 01:17:55,700
<b>You want to break her so she can't go anywhere.</b>

789
01:17:58,401 --> 01:18:00,771
<b>You want her to beg you to save her.</b>

790
01:18:01,771 --> 01:18:02,891
<b>That's what you want to see.</b>

791
01:18:05,941 --> 01:18:08,181
<b>You want to crush her so you can make her confirm...</b>

792
01:18:08,710 --> 01:18:09,990
<b>that the only man in her life...</b>

793
01:18:11,651 --> 01:18:13,080
<b>is you.</b>

794
01:18:23,691 --> 01:18:25,031
<b>So,</b>

795
01:18:27,460 --> 01:18:29,300
<b>what are your thoughts on those two?</b>

796
01:18:41,910 --> 01:18:44,950
<b>They still have feelings for each other.</b>

797
01:18:51,491 --> 01:18:53,721
<b>I'm saying, their relationship isn't over yet.</b>

798
01:19:59,691 --> 01:20:02,231
<b>(A World of Married Couple)</b>

799
01:20:02,431 --> 01:20:04,089
<b>Don't you care if your wife finds out...</b>

800
01:20:04,090 --> 01:20:06,300
<b>you keep on coming to see me?</b>

801
01:20:06,431 --> 01:20:08,470
<b>If there's any flame left,</b>

802
01:20:08,471 --> 01:20:10,670
<b>we should pour more gasoline to check.</b>

803
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:13,471
<b>What you have is love.</b>

804
01:20:13,571 --> 01:20:16,640
<b>They came to get consultation and tests done for infertility.</b>

805
01:20:16,641 --> 01:20:18,811
<b>Then Ye Rim suddenly disappeared.</b>

806
01:20:18,941 --> 01:20:20,111
<b>Someone said...</b>

807
01:20:20,580 --> 01:20:22,781
<b>a man who cheated once will cheat again.</b>

808
01:20:23,311 --> 01:20:25,880
<b>We decided to accept the donation under TO Pictures' name.</b>

809
01:20:26,021 --> 01:20:27,997
<b>They will give us 100,000 dollars each year for 10 years.</b>

810
01:20:28,021 --> 01:20:29,221
<b>I believed you.</b>

811
01:20:29,851 --> 01:20:32,890
<b>That's why I showed everything inside me without hesitation.</b>

812
01:20:32,891 --> 01:20:34,260
<b>This might sound strange,</b>

813
01:20:34,590 --> 01:20:36,290
<b>but it can't be helped at the moment.</b>

814
01:20:36,561 --> 01:20:37,960
<b>I have to protect you.</b>

815
01:20:38,130 --> 01:20:40,460
<b>I get angry beyond control whenever I see you.</b>

816
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:42,231
<b>So please...</b>

817
01:20:43,330 --> 01:20:45,040
<b>just disappear from my sight.</b>
