<b>I mind.</b>

472
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:08,305
<b>Call me Sister from now on.</b>

473
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:11,175
<b>- What?
- I'm leaving soon.</b>

474
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:13,015
<b>I don't know
when I'll get to see you next.</b>

475
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,615
<b>What?</b>

476
00:37:16,490 --> 00:37:17,645
<b>I'm going now.</b>

477
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:24,025
<b>Thanks for bringing me to Father
before I have to leave.</b>

478
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,155
<b>Sister,</b>

479
00:37:30,070 --> 00:37:31,365
<b>where are you heading to?</b>

480
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:34,035
<b>I don't know,</b>

481
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,405
<b>somewhere far.</b>

482
00:37:50,650 --> 00:37:52,585
<b>- Yes, Chef Moon?
- Mr. Kang,</b>

483
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:55,115
<b>Ms. Jang would like to meet with us.</b>

484
00:37:55,330 --> 00:37:57,585
<b>[ - Can you come with me? ]
- Why?</b>

485
00:37:57,860 --> 00:38:01,155
<b>She apparently has the last weapon
that can tear down Mr. Lim.</b>

486
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:02,765
<b>Then we should definitely meet.</b>

487
00:38:03,330 --> 00:38:06,435
<b>I guess Yu-jin doesn't know about that?</b>

488
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,095
<b>She doesn't seem like she does.</b>

489
00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:11,365
<b>What? You met with Yu-jin?</b>

490
00:38:11,570 --> 00:38:13,175
<b>Where is she right now?</b>

491
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:17,145
<b>She just left, saying that she was leaving
to somewhere far.</b>

492
00:38:51,810 --> 00:38:52,975
<b>Enjoy your flight.</b>

493
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:04,055

<b>How could you just disappear like that?</b>

496
00:39:11,270 --> 00:39:12,895
<b>Do you know how worried I was?</b>

497
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:14,595
<b>Why are you doing this?</b>

498
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:16,605
<b>Tell me!</b>

499
00:39:19,810 --> 00:39:23,305
<b>When I saw you at the hotel,</b>

500
00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:26,245
<b>I suddenly began to wonder</b>

501
00:39:27,050 --> 00:39:31,045
<b>whether my existence is any good to you.</b>

502
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,855
<b>How can you be, when you just do
whatever you want all the time?</b>

503
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:37,525
<b>That's the kind of person I am.</b>

504
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:40,499
<b>I say what I want and do what I want.</b>

505
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,895
<b>You always have to have your way
and you're so much in trouble.</b>

506
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,365
<b>But</b>

507
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:49,235
<b>that's what I like about you.</b>

508
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,445
<b>I like you.</b>

509
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,085
<b>I...</b>

510
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:29,105
<b>Don't leave, Yu-jin.</b>

511
00:40:38,450 --> 00:40:39,755
<b>Let's head to Seoha Village.</b>

512
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:45,525
<b>I'm not the only one</b>

513
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,355
<b>who's waiting for you.</b>

514
00:40:50,270 --> 00:40:52,365
<b>Seol-a, Da-hoon,</b>

515

<b>waiting for you.</b>

517
00:42:17,650 --> 00:42:20,085
<b>[ I know you resent me. ]</b>

518
00:42:20,390 --> 00:42:23,255
<b>It's not like I'm perfectly happy
with you,</b>

519
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:26,225
<b>but what's past is past.</b>

520
00:42:27,030 --> 00:42:30,625
<b>I hope we can get back to being
on good terms again like before.</b>

<b>Like before?</b>

522
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:35,835
<b>[ When? ]</b>

523
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:37,935
<b>Before</b>

524
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:42,135
<b>you killed Kang Min-suk?</b>

525
00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:45,045
<b>Or</b>

526
00:42:47,850 --> 00:42:49,785
<b>after you used that</b>

527
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:52,615
<b>to threaten me into this marriage?</b>

528
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,515
<b>You're drunk.</b>

529
00:42:58,730 --> 00:42:59,995
<b>Looking back,</b>

530
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,525
<b>I was too young</b>

531
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:05,695
<b>and too scared.</b>

532
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:07,765
<b>[ That's why ]</b>

533
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:10,965
<b>I married the man who killed my husband</b>

534
00:43:11,870 --> 00:43:13,075
<b>and blamed</b>

00:43:16,110 --> 00:43:18,445
<b>Yoo Hyo-myoung for everything.</b>

<b>What are you saying?</b>

537
00:43:23,820 --> 00:43:25,285
<b>[ I thought I was the last target ]</b>

538

<b>for your greed.</b>

539
00:43:31,030 --> 00:43:32,625
<b>I had no idea that you'd go to the extent</b>

540
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:36,525
<b>to hurt my father to steal his position.</b>

541
00:43:39,270 --> 00:43:42,535
<b>Come on. You knew that he wasn't healthy.</b>

542
00:43:57,350 --> 00:43:58,515
<b>That's nonsense.</b>

543
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:14,365
<b>You want to lose Jun-su, too?</b>

544

<b>Listen carefully.</b>

545
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:30,445
<b>This is my last warning.</b>

<b>If you try to pull off something

<b>Jun-su will end up</b>

00:44:38,230 --> 00:44:40,425
<b>just like his own father.</b>

549

<b>[ Pungcheonok ]</b>

<b>It's a relief that the restaurant is

<b>[ - Good. ]

<b>Gosh. Chef Moon, you're back!</b>

560

<b>Chef Moon, we tried selling gukbap

<b>Bella, you must've had a difficult time.</b>

<b>You could run this place without me.</b>

<b>[ You're being too kind. ]</b>

<b>Don't you think you're trying too hard
to be cool these days?</b>

628
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:25,775
<b>I really appreciate the thought.</b>

629
00:49:26,550 --> 00:49:27,815
<b>Just wait.</b>

630
00:49:28,650 --> 00:49:30,345
<b>I'll get it back for you, really.</b>

631
00:49:32,690 --> 00:49:34,889
<b>[ - I don't want to.
- Gun-woo. ]</b>

632
00:49:34,890 --> 00:49:37,585
<b>I can't and I won't.</b>

633
00:49:37,590 --> 00:49:39,499
<b>- Hey!
- To be honest,</b>

634
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:42,599
<b>I came out because I thought
that you had a new business idea.</b>

635
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:45,025
<b>We're not spies.</b>

636
00:49:45,230 --> 00:49:46,869
<b>And since we're on the topic,</b>

637
00:49:46,870 --> 00:49:50,069
<b>I was doing so well in Australia,
but I left and came to Korea for you.</b>

638
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:52,135
<b>Now, I can't even get severance pay.</b>

639
00:49:52,140 --> 00:49:55,775
<b>And yet, you've called me here again
to take revenge on Mr. Lim?</b>

640
00:49:55,910 --> 00:49:57,709
<b>- Hey.
- What?</b>

641
00:49:57,710 --> 00:49:58,779
<b>I'm right.</b>

642
00:49:58,780 --> 00:50:00,545
<b>It was already difficult
when he was a director.</b>

643
00:50:00,550 --> 00:50:03,085
<b>But he's now Chairman Lim!</b>

644
00:50:04,620 --> 00:50:07,185
<b>I don't want to be involved in this.</b>

645
00:50:07,660 --> 00:50:09,589
<b>Gun-woo! Wait.</b>

646
00:50:09,590 --> 00:50:11,155
<b>Let me go.</b>

647
00:50:12,190 --> 00:50:13,625
<b>[ Sorry I'm late. ]</b>

648
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:16,895
<b>No worries, we just got here.</b>

649
00:50:18,430 --> 00:50:19,595
<b>Hello.</b>

650
00:50:22,710 --> 00:50:25,605
<b>Last night,</b>

651
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:28,375
<b>I had a talk with Ms. Han Mi-young.</b>

652
00:50:29,350 --> 00:50:32,045
<b>She told me that she doesn't want
to be involved in any of this anymore</b>

653
00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:35,475
<b>and that she wants me to leave you out
as well.</b>

654
00:50:35,820 --> 00:50:37,045
<b>Are you going to be okay?</b>

655
00:50:37,750 --> 00:50:39,585
<b>I think having the whole group taken away</b>

656
00:50:39,890 --> 00:50:41,315
<b>hit her quite hard.</b>

657
00:50:42,190 --> 00:50:43,725
<b>I'll have a talk with her.</b>

658
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:45,125
<b>Okay.</b>

659
00:50:45,490 --> 00:50:48,525
<b>That'll make me feel a lot better.</b>

660
00:50:48,730 --> 00:50:49,825
<b>Yes, ma'am.</b>

661
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:29,335
<b>[ When did you get here? ]</b>

662
00:51:30,310 --> 00:51:31,465
<b>Just now.</b>

663
00:51:32,510 --> 00:51:34,335
<b>What are you doing?</b>

664
00:51:35,140 --> 00:51:37,775
<b>The cleaning lady will clean it all up,
no need to clean.</b>

665
00:51:38,380 --> 00:51:41,445
<b>It's okay, I just want to do this.</b>

666
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:22,155
<b>What's wrong?</b>

667
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:23,725
<b>Mother?</b>

668
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:39,465
<b>Have some.</b>

669
00:52:46,150 --> 00:52:47,345
<b>Jun-su.</b>

670
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:48,615
<b>Yes?</b>

671
00:52:51,190 --> 00:52:53,785
<b>Can you not get involved in this
from now on?</b>

672
00:52:57,430 --> 00:53:01,025
<b>Mother, I can't give up here.</b>

673
00:53:01,430 --> 00:53:03,165
<b>I can't let my grandfather's company</b>

674
00:53:03,470 --> 00:53:05,565
<b>end up in the hands of someone like him.</b>

675
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:08,435
<b>Please, I'm begging you.</b>

676
00:53:11,470 --> 00:53:12,765
<b>I'll get going now.</b>

677
00:53:14,510 --> 00:53:16,005
<b>Don't drink too much.</b>

678
00:53:17,510 --> 00:53:18,605
<b>Jun-su.</b>

<b>[ Listen carefully. ]</b>

<b>I'll tell you why your father ended up

<b>[ and why he died. ]</b>

682
00:53:29,730 --> 00:53:30,985
<b>I'll tell you everything.</b>

683

685
00:53:40,655 --> 00:53:41,910
<b>I'll tell you everything.</b>

686
00:53:54,835 --> 00:53:57,460
<b>[ What are you talking about? ]</b>

687
00:53:59,235 --> 00:54:00,600
<b>You're saying</b>

688
00:54:02,875 --> 00:54:05,400
<b>that my father didn't pass away
in an accident?</b>

689
00:54:12,315 --> 00:54:13,410
<b>Why?</b>

690
00:54:14,715 --> 00:54:17,220
<b>Why are you telling me this just now?</b>

691
00:54:18,155 --> 00:54:19,380
<b>[ So that I'd stop? ]</b>

692
00:54:19,585 --> 00:54:21,250
<b>Then you should've</b>

693
00:54:23,825 --> 00:54:26,090
<b>kept it a secret from me until the end.</b>

694
00:54:26,925 --> 00:54:28,390
<b>I'm sorry, Jun-su.</b>

695
00:54:29,235 --> 00:54:30,390
<b>[ But ]</b>

696

<b>[ I was mistaken. ]</b>

698
00:54:40,675 --> 00:54:42,140
<b>Lim Chul-yong is not</b>

699
00:54:45,245 --> 00:54:47,480
<b>someone that we can battle.</b>

700
00:54:49,815 --> 00:54:51,720
<b>I'm terrified because I don't know</b>

701
00:54:53,425 --> 00:54:54,850
<b>what he's going to do next.</b>

702
00:54:58,495 --> 00:54:59,620
<b>Jun-su,</b>

703
00:55:02,065 --> 00:55:03,360
<b>I'm begging you.</b>

704
00:55:04,765 --> 00:55:06,600
<b>Can you please stop here?</b>

705
00:55:13,505 --> 00:55:14,670
<b>I</b>

706

<b>can't understand you.</b>

707

<b>And now,</b>

708
00:55:23,755 --> 00:55:25,320
<b>you gave me a reason why I can't stop.</b>

709

<b>[ He wants to meet tonight. ]</b>

<b>Are you going to keep the restaurant open?</b>

712
00:56:08,795 --> 00:56:09,960
<b>Actually...</b>

713
00:56:10,605 --> 00:56:12,860
<b>I thought of closing it,</b>

714
00:56:14,035 --> 00:56:17,030
<b>but seeing everyone yesterday,
I realized that I shouldn't.</b>

715
00:56:17,645 --> 00:56:18,740
<b>Why?</b>

716
00:56:19,505 --> 00:56:23,040
<b>[ It's a relief that the restaurant is
still doing so well. ]</b>

717

<b>[ A week passes by so quickly ]</b>

718

719

<b>Pungcheonok is owned by everyone
in this village.</b>

720
00:56:32,385 --> 00:56:35,050
<b>It's not a restaurant that I can close
as I'd like.</b>

721
00:56:36,755 --> 00:56:38,394
<b>Then I have a share in this too, right?</b>

722
00:56:38,395 --> 00:56:39,720
<b>How much of a share do I get?</b>

723
00:56:39,925 --> 00:56:41,330
<b>Just eat.</b>

724
00:56:48,735 --> 00:56:50,840
<b>[ I'm meeting with Mr. Jin tonight. ]</b>

<b>[ I'll call you after. ]</b>

<b>He won't bring the police, would he?</b>

727
00:57:01,655 --> 00:57:03,450
<b>- Have you been shot in the head?
- What?</b>

728
00:57:04,125 --> 00:57:06,650
<b>If we get arrested, things are
going to get more difficult for them.</b>

729
00:57:07,055 --> 00:57:08,620
<b>They won't hand us over.</b>

730
00:57:34,415 --> 00:57:38,150
<b>This is Mr. Kang Jun-su.</b>

731

<b>You're Mr. Lim's son, right?</b>

732
00:57:43,895 --> 00:57:48,360
<b>What an honor it is for you
to come out here yourself.</b>

733
00:57:48,695 --> 00:57:51,000
<b>Let's cut the small talk.

<b>[ if we just take care of everything
