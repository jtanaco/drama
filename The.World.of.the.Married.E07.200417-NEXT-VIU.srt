<b>We have no reason to see each other after she got divorced.</b>

65

<b>It was too awkward for me.</b>

66
00:04:21,861 --> 00:04:24,431
<b>Of course, it's awkward. I would feel the same.</b>

<b>What is she doing?</b>

71

<b>Did you know it was my movie?</b>

76
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:24,320
<b>Why are you the producer and not the director?</b>

77
00:05:26,161 --> 00:05:29,661
<b>Because the producer is in charge of everything.</b>

<b>missed you a lot.</b>

82

<b>You never called or texted once.</b>

83

<b>Do you actually expect me to believe that?</b>

84
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,330
<b>I know...</b>

85
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:11,270
<b>you saw me do some horrible things.</b>

86

<b>And I disappointed you.</b>

87
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:16,411
<b>I wanted to change...</b>

88

<b>and become a cool dad...</b>

89

<b>It's Friday. Don't you have a date?</b>

417

<b>I should be asking you that since you're drinking alone.</b>

418

<b>You're right.</b>

419

<b>two years is?</b>

425
00:35:04,571 --> 00:35:06,300
<b>Isn't it too short...</b>

426
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:14,080
<b>to forgive someone?</b>

427
00:35:18,751 --> 00:35:21,680
<b>I had hoped he'd at least feel guilty.</b>

428

<b>I can't understand how he could think of coming back.</b>

429

<b>Time is relative to each person.</b>

430
00:35:33,901 --> 00:35:36,271
<b>He probably thinks the past is in the past.</b>

<b>Hey. Joon Young, come here.</b>

448
00:36:55,155 --> 00:36:57,456
<b>Oh my gosh. You made it.</b>

<b>I need to go get my son.</b>

<b>Is it that big a problem that he's at his dad's house?</b>

454
00:37:18,545 --> 00:37:21,016
<b>Of course, it is. He's breaking the rules.</b>

455
00:37:21,916 --> 00:37:24,115
<b>I made it clear that he can't see Joon Young...</b>

<b>without my permission.</b>

457
00:37:25,545 --> 00:37:28,456
<b>But look. He took him without even asking.</b>

458
00:37:28,456 --> 00:37:31,056
<b>Joon Young may have wanted to go.</b>

459

<b>I know my son.</b>

460

<b>He despises his dad.</b>

461
00:37:50,106 --> 00:37:52,576
<b>What do you think? It's big enough, right?</b>

462

<b>It gets good sunlight too.</b>

<b>- Whose room is it? - Yours.</b>

<b>I'll set it up so that you can come whenever you want, okay?</b>

<b>We're family.</b>

<b>The bed will go here. The desk will go here.</b>

<b>What else do you need?</b>

469
00:38:18,436 --> 00:38:21,106
<b>I'll get you a computer and install all the top games.</b>

470
00:38:32,956 --> 00:38:34,755
<b>Tae Oh, can we talk?</b>

471
00:38:37,856 --> 00:38:39,056
<b>Wait right here, son.</b>

472
00:38:55,606 --> 00:38:56,845
<b>What do you mean, it's his room?</b>

473
00:38:58,076 --> 00:38:59,675
<b>You didn't mention that to me.</b>

474
00:39:01,215 --> 00:39:03,786
<b>It's empty anyway, so I thought it would be nice.</b>

475
00:39:03,786 --> 00:39:05,686
<b>You should consult me first.</b>

476
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:07,786
<b>How could you tell him first?</b>

477
00:39:08,416 --> 00:39:09,556
<b>Are you saying no?</b>

478
00:39:11,425 --> 00:39:13,856
<b>We agreed I can see Joon Young when we decided...</b>

479
00:39:13,856 --> 00:39:15,326
<b>to move back to Gosan.</b>

480
00:39:16,226 --> 00:39:19,195
<b>That boy having his own room in my house is a different story.</b>

481
00:39:20,295 --> 00:39:23,235
<b>I hope you won't decide on things without talking to me first.</b>

482
00:39:25,606 --> 00:39:26,675
<b>Da Kyung!</b>

483
00:39:27,505 --> 00:39:28,576
<b>Da Kyung!</b>

484
00:39:36,416 --> 00:39:37,686
<b>(Mom)</b>

485
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:49,965
<b>The person you have reached is not available.</b>

486
00:39:50,226 --> 00:39:52,065
<b>Please leave a message after the tone.</b>

487
00:39:55,436 --> 00:39:57,666
<b>(Sorry, there are no taxis available)</b>

488
00:40:14,416 --> 00:40:16,586
<b>You'll never get a cab in this weather. Get in.</b>

489
00:40:19,086 --> 00:40:21,456
<b>I didn't drink. Get in.</b>

490
00:40:23,795 --> 00:40:24,865
<b>Thank you.</b>

491
00:40:41,146 --> 00:40:42,516
<b>I mean it.</b>

492
00:40:42,516 --> 00:40:44,246
<b>- Really? - Yes.</b>

493
00:40:44,485 --> 00:40:45,845
<b>All right, everyone.</b>

494
00:40:47,286 --> 00:40:50,126
<b>- Ta-da. - Congratulations, Da Kyung.</b>

495
00:40:50,126 --> 00:40:51,326
<b>Thank you.</b>

496
00:40:51,655 --> 00:40:54,126
<b>- Take a seat. - My goodness.</b>

497
00:40:54,655 --> 00:40:55,795
<b>You gave birth,</b>

498
00:40:56,226 --> 00:40:59,896
<b>but you're still fit as if you're unmarried.</b>

499
00:41:01,766 --> 00:41:05,306
<b>You must have had a difficult time, but your husband became successful.</b>

500
00:41:05,606 --> 00:41:07,005
<b>You must be so proud.</b>

501
00:41:07,876 --> 00:41:09,576
<b>You won't worry your mom anymore, right?</b>

502
00:41:12,376 --> 00:41:14,576
<b>I had knew it from the start.</b>

503
00:41:15,416 --> 00:41:16,786
<b>Both of my parents...</b>

504
00:41:17,385 --> 00:41:19,615
<b>ended up respecting my decision.</b>

505
00:41:22,286 --> 00:41:25,956
<b>If I was scared of what clueless people yapped about,</b>

506
00:41:26,956 --> 00:41:29,155
<b>Jenny and the box office hit film...</b>

507
00:41:30,226 --> 00:41:32,065
<b>wouldn't be a part of my life.</b>

508
00:41:35,465 --> 00:41:36,465
<b>All right.</b>

509
00:41:36,465 --> 00:41:39,876
<b>You'll accept Da Kyung as a member of Gosan Women's Association, right?</b>

510
00:41:41,876 --> 00:41:43,275
<b>Well...</b>

511
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:47,175
<b>Of course.</b>

512
00:41:49,175 --> 00:41:51,146
<b>We should raise our glasses to celebrate.</b>

513
00:41:51,146 --> 00:41:52,246
<b>I would like that.</b>

514
00:41:53,416 --> 00:41:55,115
<b>- Here's yours, Mom. - Thanks, dear.</b>

515
00:41:55,215 --> 00:41:57,586
<b>Congratulations on becoming a member of the association.</b>

516
00:41:57,726 --> 00:41:59,056
<b>- Thank you. - Cheers.</b>

517
00:41:59,056 --> 00:42:00,956
<b>- Cheers. - Cheers.</b>

518
00:42:10,206 --> 00:42:11,336
<b>Okay.</b>

519
00:42:11,465 --> 00:42:13,505
<b>Please excuse us for a moment. You can carry on.</b>

520
00:42:13,505 --> 00:42:15,606
<b>- See you later. - Let's go.</b>

521
00:42:17,675 --> 00:42:19,146
<b>She became quite confident.</b>

522
00:42:20,146 --> 00:42:23,186
<b>She's no longer the young girl who left Gosan in tears.</b>

523
00:42:25,345 --> 00:42:28,755
<b>- She was rude from the start. - That's true.</b>

524
00:42:28,815 --> 00:42:30,885
<b>She was always insolent.</b>

525
00:42:31,626 --> 00:42:34,025
<b>That's how she stole a married man.</b>

526
00:42:41,936 --> 00:42:43,065
<b>Gosh.</b>

527
00:42:46,536 --> 00:42:47,635
<b>Seriously.</b>

528
00:43:14,235 --> 00:43:15,965
<b>This is a lot of people for a party.</b>

529
00:43:17,936 --> 00:43:20,076
<b>People who are influential in the region...</b>

530
00:43:21,336 --> 00:43:22,876
<b>were all invited.</b>

531
00:43:25,005 --> 00:43:26,115
<b>My goodness.</b>

532
00:43:26,615 --> 00:43:28,876
<b>Sun Woo, what are you doing here?</b>

533
00:43:30,385 --> 00:43:31,945
<b>Dr. Kim, you came too.</b>

534
00:43:32,545 --> 00:43:35,155
<b>- Have you seen Joon Young? - Joon Young?</b>

535
00:43:35,786 --> 00:43:38,226
<b>Did Joon Young come?</b>

536
00:43:40,056 --> 00:43:41,226
<b>I might have seen him.</b>

537
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:43,726
<b>Where did he go anyway?</b>

538
00:43:45,666 --> 00:43:46,965
<b>I can't seem to spot him.</b>

539
00:43:50,836 --> 00:43:51,936
<b>What is it?</b>

540
00:44:33,416 --> 00:44:35,445
<b>Couldn't you control your curiosity?</b>

541
00:44:36,385 --> 00:44:38,545
<b>I thought you wanted to show me.</b>

542
00:44:40,815 --> 00:44:42,885
<b>That's why you sent the picture.</b>

543
00:44:44,385 --> 00:44:47,056
<b>Are you sure you're not using Joon Young as an excuse to come?</b>

544
00:44:47,655 --> 00:44:50,795
<b>Sure, let's just say that.</b>

545
00:44:53,795 --> 00:44:56,135
<b>Don't ruin our party and leave.</b>

546
00:44:56,836 --> 00:44:58,536
<b>I'll take Joon Young home later.</b>

547
00:44:59,836 --> 00:45:01,306
<b>I'm afraid I can't agree to that.</b>

548
00:45:27,695 --> 00:45:28,836
<b>Da Kyung.</b>

549
00:45:32,106 --> 00:45:34,175
<b>- We should go. - No.</b>

550
00:45:36,806 --> 00:45:38,445
<b>I won't leave without Joon Young.</b>

551
00:45:38,845 --> 00:45:39,945
<b>Are you really going to do this?</b>

552
00:45:46,556 --> 00:45:47,655
<b>Hey.</b>

553
00:45:50,755 --> 00:45:51,856
<b>Hello.</b>

554
00:45:53,456 --> 00:45:55,255
<b>I knew you were really something,</b>

555
00:45:56,425 --> 00:45:58,166
<b>but I didn't expect this.</b>

556
00:46:00,065 --> 00:46:02,135
<b>How did you even think about coming here?</b>

557
00:46:02,135 --> 00:46:03,666
<b>That's what I'd like to ask.</b>

558
00:46:05,465 --> 00:46:06,536
<b>How could you...</b>

559
00:46:08,175 --> 00:46:10,175
<b>even think about coming back?</b>

560
00:46:11,976 --> 00:46:14,146
<b>We have the right to decide where we want to live.</b>

561
00:46:15,646 --> 00:46:19,016
<b>You were the last thing on our minds when we made our choice.</b>

562
00:46:19,545 --> 00:46:20,755
<b>So don't worry about that...</b>

563
00:46:21,655 --> 00:46:23,456
<b>and please leave.</b>

564
00:46:25,786 --> 00:46:29,126
<b>This is an invitation-only party.</b>

565
00:46:36,166 --> 00:46:37,235
<b>I thought...</b>

566
00:46:38,965 --> 00:46:40,436
<b>you sent this.</b>

567
00:46:41,576 --> 00:46:42,675
<b>If not,</b>

568
00:46:44,206 --> 00:46:45,545
<b>who could've sent it?</b>

569
00:46:54,456 --> 00:46:56,525
<b>I didn't come here because I'm curious to know how you live.</b>

570
00:46:57,226 --> 00:47:00,726
<b>I have zero interest in that, so please don't worry.</b>

571
00:47:01,655 --> 00:47:02,795
<b>I'll just...</b>

572
00:47:03,666 --> 00:47:05,465
<b>take my son and leave.</b>

573
00:47:07,936 --> 00:47:09,036
<b>Joon Young.</b>

574
00:47:12,166 --> 00:47:13,275
<b>Joon Young.</b>

575
00:47:52,306 --> 00:47:54,315
<b>Da Kyung, are you okay?</b>

576
00:47:54,545 --> 00:47:56,786
<b>Go and kick that woman out first!</b>

577
00:47:58,286 --> 00:47:59,445
<b>Right now.</b>

578
00:48:35,885 --> 00:48:37,025
<b>Joon Young.</b>

579
00:49:38,445 --> 00:49:39,916
<b>Please come this way.</b>

580
00:49:41,016 --> 00:49:43,885
<b>I'm not sure if it's okay for us to look through the house.</b>

581
00:49:44,025 --> 00:49:46,826
<b>Going on a tour is the fun part of any housewarming party.</b>

582
00:49:48,126 --> 00:49:50,726
<b>Yes. Please come this way. This way.</b>

583
00:49:52,025 --> 00:49:53,795
<b>All right.</b>

584
00:49:55,735 --> 00:49:58,965
<b>It's so bright. It really says they're newlyweds.</b>

585
00:50:00,836 --> 00:50:03,845
<b>There's no question the couple is deeply in love.</b>

586
00:50:04,806 --> 00:50:07,845
<b>This is from Italy, isn't it?</b>

587
00:50:08,576 --> 00:50:12,246
<b>My goodness. This must have cost a fortune.</b>

588
00:50:12,345 --> 00:50:15,655
<b>It took six months for us to receive everything.</b>

589
00:50:15,916 --> 00:50:17,626
<b>Once we made the order, they made it for us.</b>

590
00:50:18,255 --> 00:50:19,485
<b>I bet.</b>

591
00:50:19,755 --> 00:50:22,496
<b>That's why they say furniture from Italian masters...</b>

592
00:50:22,896 --> 00:50:26,195
<b>isn't furniture but are works of art.</b>

593
00:50:27,666 --> 00:50:31,005
<b>My goodness. Just look at this color.</b>

594
00:50:31,565 --> 00:50:33,675
<b>If Dr. Ji saw this,</b>

595
00:50:34,606 --> 00:50:35,876
<b>she'd be jealous.</b>

596
00:50:38,045 --> 00:50:40,576
<b>I know they got a divorce because things didn't work out,</b>

597
00:50:40,576 --> 00:50:43,786
<b>but it would still hurt to see them live so happily with each other.</b>

598
00:50:55,956 --> 00:50:58,626
<b>I put in a lot of effort to decorate this room since they're newlyweds.</b>

599
00:51:01,465 --> 00:51:03,706
<b>We took a look at the bedroom, so let's move on.</b>

600
00:51:03,706 --> 00:51:04,905
<b>- Come this way. - Okay.</b>

601
00:51:04,905 --> 00:51:06,675
<b>This leads right to their study.</b>

602
00:51:10,876 --> 00:51:14,246
<b>My goodness, look at that.</b>

603
00:52:49,436 --> 00:52:50,476
<b>Are you crazy?</b>

604
00:52:50,675 --> 00:52:52,246
<b>What are you doing in our bedroom?</b>

605
00:52:53,775 --> 00:52:55,045
<b>Why are you back?</b>

606
00:52:56,146 --> 00:52:57,286
<b>I heard your business is doing well.</b>

607
00:52:57,916 --> 00:52:59,416
<b>Why couldn't you just stay in Seoul?</b>

608
00:53:01,115 --> 00:53:02,255
<b>Why did you have to come back?</b>

609
00:53:02,255 --> 00:53:04,525
<b>My wife wanted to live near her parents.</b>

610
00:53:04,525 --> 00:53:06,726
<b>You moved here because that's what they wanted?</b>

611
00:53:07,025 --> 00:53:10,226
<b>They took me in when you kicked me out.</b>

612
00:53:10,465 --> 00:53:13,166
<b>Her parents wanted us here, so it's natural that we came back.</b>

613
00:53:17,336 --> 00:53:18,666
<b>Are you still not over me?</b>

614
00:53:26,945 --> 00:53:28,715
<b>You must've been really lonely, Sun Woo.</b>

615
00:53:39,286 --> 00:53:40,356
<b>This is nice.</b>

616
00:53:43,766 --> 00:53:44,965
<b>Isn't this great?</b>

617
00:54:09,655 --> 00:54:11,985
<b>I'm happily married to Da Kyung.</b>

618
00:54:13,755 --> 00:54:16,326
<b>I don't even remember how we were together.</b>

619
00:54:17,925 --> 00:54:18,965
<b>Do you really mean that?</b>

620
00:54:19,925 --> 00:54:21,735
<b>Isn't it pretty obvious?</b>

621
00:54:22,235 --> 00:54:25,306
<b>You mean nothing to me.</b>

622
00:54:25,306 --> 00:54:26,465
<b>You're my past.</b>

623
00:54:27,336 --> 00:54:28,806
<b>The only woman I love now...</b>

624
00:54:30,775 --> 00:54:32,076
<b>is Da Kyung.</b>

625
00:54:36,076 --> 00:54:37,815
<b>You used Joon Young as an excuse...</b>

626
00:54:37,815 --> 00:54:39,186
<b>to come all the way to our house.</b>

627
00:54:40,045 --> 00:54:41,916
<b>And not only did you send me an invitation,</b>

628
00:54:42,456 --> 00:54:43,956
<b>but you also sent me that photo.</b>

629
00:54:43,956 --> 00:54:45,856
<b>You obviously did all that to provoke me.</b>

630
00:54:47,255 --> 00:54:48,396
<b>You did it because of me.</b>

631
00:54:49,726 --> 00:54:50,896
<b>You just wanted to see me.</b>

632
00:54:54,795 --> 00:54:55,836
<b>Am I wrong?</b>

633
00:54:57,005 --> 00:54:58,036
<b>Yes.</b>

634
00:54:59,635 --> 00:55:00,635
<b>You're wrong.</b>

635
00:55:05,775 --> 00:55:07,576
<b>Will you please leave my house now?</b>

636
00:55:10,215 --> 00:55:11,746
<b>Before you get even more humiliated.</b>

637
00:57:10,675 --> 00:57:13,376
<b>Mr. Lee Tae Oh and his wife, the hosts of today's party,</b>

638
00:57:13,816 --> 00:57:16,175
<b>will be giving us a short speech.</b>

639
00:57:16,175 --> 00:57:17,286
<b>Let's give them a round of applause.</b>

640
00:57:17,945 --> 00:57:19,016
<b>Nice.</b>

641
00:57:22,056 --> 00:57:25,686
<b>I would've felt a bit upset if Councilman Cha didn't give us...</b>

642
00:57:26,126 --> 00:57:27,626
<b>such a grand introduction.</b>

643
00:57:29,856 --> 00:57:33,396
<b>He really loves getting attention.</b>

644
00:57:33,766 --> 00:57:34,836
<b>Later on,</b>

645
00:57:35,635 --> 00:57:36,836
<b>I might even make him sing.</b>

646
00:57:42,476 --> 00:57:45,545
<b>Thank you so much for coming here...</b>

647
00:57:46,505 --> 00:57:47,615
<b>to congratulate our new beginning.</b>

648
00:57:49,246 --> 00:57:50,786
<b>I know we had to leave...</b>

649
00:58:00,726 --> 00:58:01,896
<b>due to what happened in the past.</b>

650
00:58:04,726 --> 00:58:06,795
<b>But we always missed our hometown.</b>

651
00:58:09,336 --> 00:58:10,336
<b>We will...</b>

652
00:58:11,166 --> 00:58:12,166
<b>never...</b>

653
00:58:13,465 --> 00:58:16,106
<b>leave this place again.</b>

654
00:58:20,916 --> 00:58:24,146
<b>Da Kyung stayed by my side when I was going through my worst.</b>

655
00:58:27,856 --> 00:58:28,885
<b>And...</b>

656
00:58:29,686 --> 00:58:33,525
<b>the same goes for Jenny, my one and only daughter...</b>

657
00:58:34,056 --> 00:58:35,226
<b>and precious princess.</b>

658
00:58:36,056 --> 00:58:38,626
<b>The three of us will live happily in Gosan for as long as we can.</b>

659
00:58:39,126 --> 00:58:40,126
<b>Thank you.</b>

660
00:58:43,806 --> 00:58:44,806
<b>Give Daddy a kiss.</b>

661
00:58:46,066 --> 00:58:47,905
<b>She's so adorable.</b>

662
00:58:50,646 --> 00:58:52,575
<b>- Good job. - She's so cute.</b>

663
00:59:12,996 --> 00:59:14,266
<b>You're my past.</b>

664
00:59:15,235 --> 00:59:16,465
<b>The only woman I love now...</b>

665
00:59:18,005 --> 00:59:19,336
<b>is Da Kyung.</b>

666
00:59:23,336 --> 00:59:25,106
<b>Will you please leave my house now?</b>

667
00:59:27,876 --> 00:59:29,376
<b>Before you get even more humiliated.</b>

668
00:59:43,025 --> 00:59:44,095
<b>Dr. Ji Sun Woo.</b>

669
00:59:54,735 --> 00:59:58,306
<b>Thank you very much for coming today.</b>

670
01:00:01,016 --> 01:00:05,316
<b>You're here to congratulate us and give us your blessing, right?</b>

671
01:00:08,086 --> 01:00:10,215
<b>We'll run into each other often now.</b>

672
01:00:11,155 --> 01:00:13,586
<b>Let's let bygones be bygones,</b>

673
01:00:14,896 --> 01:00:16,726
<b>and wish each other happiness...</b>

674
01:00:17,666 --> 01:00:19,226
<b>and get along.</b>

675
01:00:27,505 --> 01:00:28,735
<b>You'll do that, won't you?</b>

676
01:00:51,566 --> 01:00:54,496
<b>Okay! How about a toast?</b>

677
01:00:55,235 --> 01:00:56,396
<b>Raise your glasses.</b>

678
01:00:59,166 --> 01:01:01,336
<b>Let's toast to "Good Life".</b>

679
01:01:05,045 --> 01:01:07,045
<b>Your dad must have made a lot of money.</b>

680
01:01:07,876 --> 01:01:08,976
<b>Lucky you.</b>

681
01:01:09,345 --> 01:01:12,246
<b>It's cold. Aren't we going back in?</b>

682
01:01:12,246 --> 01:01:13,316
<b>Be honest.</b>

683
01:01:13,845 --> 01:01:15,056
<b>You want to live here too, right?</b>

684
01:01:15,356 --> 01:01:18,126
<b>It's much nicer than your mom's house.</b>

685
01:01:18,956 --> 01:01:20,126
<b>Your step-mom is pretty too.</b>

686
01:01:21,856 --> 01:01:23,856
<b>- Shut it. - What?</b>

687
01:01:24,525 --> 01:01:26,465
<b>- You look like you'll hit me. - Hae Kang.</b>

688
01:01:27,095 --> 01:01:29,735
<b>- What's your problem? - I'm fed up with you.</b>

689
01:01:31,735 --> 01:01:32,936
<b>Stop it!</b>

690
01:01:36,175 --> 01:01:37,246
<b>Joon Young!</b>

691
01:01:39,045 --> 01:01:40,146
<b>Get over here now!</b>

692
01:02:22,115 --> 01:02:24,356
<b>- Congratulations. - Congratulations.</b>

693
01:03:13,066 --> 01:03:15,836
<b>Why are you getting mad at me? You're the one in the wrong!</b>

694
01:03:16,376 --> 01:03:18,905
<b>Why did you have to come? It's humiliating!</b>

695
01:03:31,786 --> 01:03:32,885
<b>Did you come with him?</b>

696
01:03:39,025 --> 01:03:40,166
<b>Get in. Now.</b>

697
01:04:16,536 --> 01:04:17,666
<b>Congratulations.</b>

698
01:04:18,066 --> 01:04:19,536
<b>Stop that.</b>

699
01:04:19,865 --> 01:04:22,536
<b>- It was all you. - No way.</b>

700
01:04:25,345 --> 01:04:26,445
<b>Honey!</b>

701
01:04:32,715 --> 01:04:35,715
<b>Come. Let's have a family toast.</b>

702
01:04:36,985 --> 01:04:38,786
<b>- Here. - Here's to our family's happiness.</b>

703
01:04:38,856 --> 01:04:40,925
<b>- Cheers. - Cheers.</b>

704
01:04:40,925 --> 01:04:42,025
<b>- Good job. - Thank you.</b>

705
01:04:59,746 --> 01:05:00,876
<b>Get out.</b>

706
01:05:04,586 --> 01:05:05,985
<b>Don't scold him too much.</b>

707
01:05:07,115 --> 01:05:08,356
<b>Mind your own business.</b>

708
01:05:25,666 --> 01:05:27,005
<b>I embarrass you?</b>

709
01:05:30,575 --> 01:05:31,746
<b>Aren't you?</b>

710
01:05:32,505 --> 01:05:34,545
<b>Imagine what people must think.</b>

711
01:05:34,545 --> 01:05:37,516
<b>Don't blame others. Tell me what you think!</b>

712
01:05:38,646 --> 01:05:39,916
<b>Do I embarrass you?</b>

713
01:05:51,566 --> 01:05:54,095
<b>If you had been honest with me, I would've let you go.</b>

714
01:05:54,536 --> 01:05:56,735
<b>I wouldn't have gone there to look for you.</b>

715
01:05:56,735 --> 01:05:59,235
<b>Stop lying. You wouldn't have let me go.</b>

716
01:06:00,976 --> 01:06:02,336
<b>You said you didn't want to go.</b>

717
01:06:03,075 --> 01:06:04,905
<b>That's what you told me.</b>

718
01:06:06,476 --> 01:06:09,316
<b>What? You're preparing for your performance assessment?</b>

719
01:06:10,045 --> 01:06:13,316
<b>Did you want to go so badly, that you lied to me?</b>

720
01:06:16,986 --> 01:06:19,925
<b>Lee Joon Young. Answer me!</b>

721
01:06:19,925 --> 01:06:21,495
<b>Yes, I wanted to go!</b>

722
01:06:22,595 --> 01:06:25,026
<b>Dad knows what I like better than you do.</b>

723
01:06:59,595 --> 01:07:03,396
<b>With my princess, my one and only daughter in the world,</b>

724
01:07:04,306 --> 01:07:05,535
<b>Jenny,</b>

725
01:07:06,465 --> 01:07:08,936
<b>the three of us will live happily in Gosan for as long as we can.</b>

726
01:07:09,476 --> 01:07:10,576
<b>Thank you.</b>

727
01:07:13,005 --> 01:07:14,146
<b>Give Daddy a kiss.</b>

728
01:08:11,705 --> 01:08:12,866
<b>Thank you...</b>

729
01:08:14,406 --> 01:08:15,736
<b>for marrying me.</b>

730
01:08:21,946 --> 01:08:23,076
<b>I saw that woman...</b>

731
01:08:25,715 --> 01:08:27,785
<b>walking out of our bedroom.</b>

732
01:08:30,255 --> 01:08:31,356
<b>What happened?</b>

733
01:08:33,585 --> 01:08:36,156
<b>To be honest, I didn't expect her to go that far.</b>

734
01:08:37,925 --> 01:08:40,196
<b>I guess our return was very traumatizing.</b>

735
01:08:42,066 --> 01:08:45,965
<b>I am her past that she never wants to see again.</b>

736
01:08:47,106 --> 01:08:51,245
<b>Thanks to that, I realized more just how much I love you.</b>

737
01:08:53,675 --> 01:08:55,076
<b>You are my present.</b>

738
01:08:55,915 --> 01:08:57,616
<b>You are the only one...</b>

739
01:08:59,316 --> 01:09:00,415
<b>that matters to me.</b>

740
01:09:01,316 --> 01:09:02,486
<b>I'll give up...</b>

741
01:09:04,316 --> 01:09:05,986
<b>Joon Young's room too, if it bothers you.</b>

742
01:10:52,495 --> 01:10:53,625
<b>Crazy jerk.</b>

743
01:11:05,705 --> 01:11:08,045
<b>What's the schedule for this month?</b>

744
01:11:08,345 --> 01:11:09,476
<b>Here it is.</b>

745
01:11:09,476 --> 01:11:10,816
<b>- Gosh, is it done already? - Yes.</b>

746
01:11:11,016 --> 01:11:13,186
<b>Do you have the list of equipment we need for the ER?</b>

747
01:11:14,285 --> 01:11:16,856
<b>We only need these ones.</b>

748
01:11:17,016 --> 01:11:18,125
<b>Great.</b>

749
01:11:19,755 --> 01:11:20,755
<b>Dr. Ji.</b>

750
01:11:23,255 --> 01:11:25,295
<b>You can leave these with me. I'll let you know afterward.</b>

751
01:11:25,295 --> 01:11:26,295
<b>Okay.</b>

752
01:11:32,736 --> 01:11:33,906
<b>Do you have something to say?</b>

753
01:11:34,976 --> 01:11:36,205
<b>It's about yesterday.</b>

754
01:11:37,776 --> 01:11:39,906
<b>I really wasn't planning to go...</b>

755
01:11:39,906 --> 01:11:40,946
<b>Right.</b>

756
01:11:42,146 --> 01:11:45,516
<b>I saw the order request for the medicine you sent recently.</b>

757
01:11:45,715 --> 01:11:48,316
<b>I noticed an error in the data from the previous quarter.</b>

758
01:11:49,255 --> 01:11:50,255
<b>Really?</b>

759
01:11:50,955 --> 01:11:52,885
<b>Can you double-check and resend the request?</b>

760
01:11:53,326 --> 01:11:54,326
<b>Are you...</b>

761
01:11:55,595 --> 01:11:56,995
<b>really mad at me?</b>

762
01:12:03,236 --> 01:12:04,866
<b>- Nurse An. - Yes?</b>

763
01:12:05,066 --> 01:12:07,165
<b>Can you give me an hour break from seeing outpatients?</b>

764
01:12:07,165 --> 01:12:08,535
<b>I have a lot of documents to review.</b>

765
01:12:08,535 --> 01:12:10,476
<b>- Yes, ma'am. - Thank you.</b>

766
01:12:25,785 --> 01:12:27,356
<b>Are you stressed about something?</b>

767
01:12:28,056 --> 01:12:30,226
<b>No, I'm not stressed.</b>

768
01:12:31,665 --> 01:12:33,465
<b>I'm just tired.</b>

769
01:12:37,635 --> 01:12:41,165
<b>How did you end up coming to that party together yesterday?</b>

770
01:12:41,576 --> 01:12:42,875
<b>We had dinner together.</b>

771
01:12:43,505 --> 01:12:45,745
<b>Dr. Ji said she'll go to the party,</b>

772
01:12:47,045 --> 01:12:49,215
<b>and I was worried about her going there alone.</b>

773
01:12:49,715 --> 01:12:51,316
<b>That's why I went along.</b>

774
01:12:52,245 --> 01:12:53,345
<b>Are you saying...</b>

775
01:12:54,215 --> 01:12:55,755
<b>you left after dropping her off?</b>

776
01:12:55,986 --> 01:12:57,455
<b>No, I was waiting outside.</b>

777
01:12:57,455 --> 01:12:59,955
<b>You waited for Sun Woo?</b>

778
01:13:00,585 --> 01:13:02,396
<b>Yes. I was worried.</b>

779
01:13:16,035 --> 01:13:17,236
<b>What is that about?</b>

780
01:13:17,906 --> 01:13:19,345
<b>Are they together already?</b>

781
01:13:25,146 --> 01:13:26,146
<b>Are you serious?</b>

782
01:13:26,146 --> 01:13:27,186
<b>(Lee Tae Oh)</b>

<b>Hey, don't invite me next time.</b>

<b>I'm in a difficult place because of you.</b>

785
01:13:34,486 --> 01:13:36,295
<b>- Hello. - Anyway,</b>

786
01:13:36,295 --> 01:13:38,726
<b>I'm meeting your director tonight. You should join.</b>

787
01:13:38,726 --> 01:13:40,566
<b>So what if you're meeting the director?</b>

788
01:13:42,936 --> 01:13:43,995
<b>Why are you calling me?</b>

789
01:13:48,906 --> 01:13:50,076
<b>It'll be good for you.</b>

790
01:13:50,875 --> 01:13:51,946
<b>See you tonight.</b>

798
01:16:16,356 --> 01:16:18,156
<b>I'm on board with it,</b>

799
01:16:18,585 --> 01:16:21,595
<b>but my father-in-law is especially interested...</b>

<b>is a respectable person.</b>

803
01:16:27,595 --> 01:16:29,035
<b>It doesn't matter if it's used...</b>

804

<b>for seniors living alone or kids living under single parents.</b>

805

<b>We won't be picky about how it's used.</b>

806
01:16:33,806 --> 01:16:35,436
<b>I'm sure you had a difficult time.</b>

807

<b>Before that,</b>

01:16:43,446 --> 01:16:45,016
<b>there's one thing that bothers me.</b>

812
01:16:45,885 --> 01:16:49,656
<b>My in-laws aren't the type to complain,</b>

813
01:16:50,285 --> 01:16:51,356
<b>but as you know,</b>

814
01:16:52,125 --> 01:16:54,995
<b>I'm ashamed in front of them.</b>

815

<b>I'm talking about Ji Sun Woo.</b>

816

<b>Do you have to have her as your associate director?</b>

<b>Yes.</b>

821

<b>Don't you think there's a reason why I came back to Gosan?</b>

<b>Joon Young.</b>

823
01:18:29,885 --> 01:18:31,656
<b>If I owe anyone something,</b>

824
01:18:32,656 --> 01:18:34,356
<b>I should pay them back.</b>

825

<b>Things keep on happening to them as soon as Tae Oh returned.</b>

<b>It'd be dangerous to stay in a house with poor security.</b>

831

<b>It's not that I don't like Joon Young.</b>

832
01:19:37,255 --> 01:19:39,656
<b>The housewarming party was enough.</b>

833
01:19:39,856 --> 01:19:41,125
<b>I personally think this is too much.</b>

834

<b>This is between us women.</b>

835

<b>You don't need to know about this.</b>

836
01:19:45,696 --> 01:19:47,295
<b>Are you sure you can take care of this?</b>

837

<b>If you disapprove, I'll just cancel everything.</b>

<b>Be careful. They're not easy to fight against.</b>

839
01:19:53,665 --> 01:19:55,806
<b>You came unannounced and messed with my stuff.</b>

840
01:19:56,135 --> 01:19:58,076
<b>Then you barged in and attacked me.</b>

841
01:19:58,406 --> 01:20:01,175
<b>But did you think I'd get scared and run away?</b>
