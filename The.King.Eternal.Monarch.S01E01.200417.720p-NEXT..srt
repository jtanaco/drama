2

<b>during King Sinmun's reign in the Silla Dynasty.</b>

3

<b>This is recorded in Memorabilia of the Three Kingdoms.</b>

4
00:00:19,469 --> 00:00:21,455
<b>"In spring of the year 682,</b>

5
00:00:21,772 --> 00:00:24,125
<b>King Sinmun received a bamboo flute</b>

6
00:00:24,474 --> 00:00:27,195
<b>from the Dragon King of the East Sea.</b>

7
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:32,335
<b>When the flute is played,</b>

8
00:00:32,382 --> 00:00:35,135
<b>enemies would retreat, diseases would be cured,</b>

9
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:38,745
<b>rain would fall during droughts, the rainy season would end,</b>

10
00:00:38,922 --> 00:00:40,415
<b>the wind would stop,</b>

11
00:00:40,824 --> 00:00:43,015
<b>and strong waves would subside."</b>

12
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:45,760
<b>Seeing its powers,</b>

13
00:00:45,762 --> 00:00:47,630
<b>King Sinmun named the flute</b>

14
00:00:47,631 --> 00:00:50,085
<b>"Manpasikjeok"</b>

15
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,585
<b>and designated it as a national treasure.</b>

<b>Although for people who do not believe the story,</b>

17
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:02,895
<b>it is merely a myth.</b>

18

24
00:01:18,962 --> 00:01:21,085
<b>For me, this is harder to believe.</b>

25
00:01:22,966 --> 00:01:24,800
<b>I really am 70 this year.</b>

26
00:01:24,801 --> 00:01:27,525
<b>I hardly aged</b>

27

30

<b>You're just a guy born in 1951.</b>

31
00:01:39,616 --> 00:01:43,805
<b>Because I finally got my hands on the Manpasikjeok.</b>

32
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:48,115
<b>I took it from my brother who had it, but did not believe in it.</b>

33

36

<b>to wish peace upon the world.</b>

38

<b>Just answer yes or no.</b>

39
00:02:01,972 --> 00:02:03,395
<b>So</b>

40
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:05,325
<b>did you kill your brother?</b>

41
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:07,895
<b>Yes, I did.</b>

42
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:11,835
<b>He was allowed to see it every day.</b>

43

<b>My naive half-brother, who became King</b>

<b>just because he was born the legitimate son,</b>

45
00:02:18,255 --> 00:02:20,515
<b>did not do anything</b>

46

<b>when he had the world in his hands.</b>

47

<b>He did not even know that the Manpasikjeok in his hands</b>

48

<b>would bring the world to him.</b>

49

50

<b>I need to do an additional pat-down search.</b>

<b>His Majesty does not like others touching his body.</b>

<b>His Majesty is going to the VIP horse riding course.</b>

<b>I'm going to drop by my bedroom first.</b>

<b>And don't say a word to His Majesty.</b>

344

<b>Gosh,</b>

345
00:37:49,751 --> 00:37:53,545
<b>I heard this talisman is the most effective for finding a lover.</b>

346

<b>What? Why aren't you answering?</b>

347

<b>These really seem to be effective.</b>

<b>I guess they have the power to pull people toward you.</b>

<b>You believe that someone might actually answer your desperate prayers.</b>

362
00:38:43,604 --> 00:38:46,525
<b>I have my reasons, you know.</b>

363
00:38:46,841 --> 00:38:51,410
<b>The royal court is unstable more than ever.</b>

364

<b>So, you know, you should get married--</b>

365

<b>I do not want to.</b>

<b>I am not interested.</b>

368
00:39:02,357 --> 00:39:07,690
<b>How can you not be interested when you are so young and decent?</b>

369
00:39:07,695 --> 00:39:10,760
<b>My goodness. This is unbelievable.</b>

370
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:15,385
<b>You are the very first woman to be so rude to me since I sat on the throne.</b>

372
00:39:21,476 --> 00:39:22,670
<b>Oh, my.</b>

00:39:26,881 --> 00:39:30,235
<b>Tell Prime Minister Koo we'll meet in two hours as planned.</b>

<b>Yeong, I found talismans again.</b>

378
00:40:35,216 --> 00:40:38,305
<b>There were 8 today. That's 51 in total.</b>

379
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:40,505
<b>Really?</b>

380
00:40:43,791 --> 00:40:45,175
<b>Why?</b>

381
00:40:45,293 --> 00:40:46,890
<b>Is it not 51?</b>

382
00:40:46,894 --> 00:40:49,815
<b>Did she hide more than that when you were keeping a lookout?</b>

383
00:40:51,232 --> 00:40:53,300
<b>I didn't take an active part in it.</b>

384
00:40:53,301 --> 00:40:56,625
<b>Well, I'm going to reprimand you actively, so just wait.</b>

385
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:20,415
<b>I know I'm here early, Your Majesty.</b>

386
00:41:21,162 --> 00:41:23,130
<b>The weather was nice,</b>

387
00:41:23,130 --> 00:41:26,325
<b>and I missed Maximus, so I hurried a bit.</b>

388
00:41:28,236 --> 00:41:29,925
<b>Hi, Maximus.</b>

389
00:41:31,239 --> 00:41:32,600
<b>It doesn't like women.</b>

390
00:41:32,607 --> 00:41:34,270
<b>And it's spoiled, so it bites people too.</b>

391
00:41:34,275 --> 00:41:35,725
<b>Me too.</b>

392
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:38,365
<b>I bite people often as well.</b>

393
00:41:38,946 --> 00:41:40,510
<b>Can you wave your hand?</b>

394
00:41:40,515 --> 00:41:43,250
<b>They're filming us 50 meters away.</b>

395
00:41:43,251 --> 00:41:46,345
<b>The Royal Public Affairs Office thought a photo here would look great.</b>

396
00:41:47,588 --> 00:41:49,645
<b>It'll be hard to walk together.</b>

397
00:41:50,091 --> 00:41:51,150
<b>Just stand over here.</b>

398
00:41:51,158 --> 00:41:53,085
<b>Your left face is pretty.</b>

399
00:41:53,961 --> 00:41:55,990
<b>And next time, wear more comfortable shoes.</b>

400
00:41:55,997 --> 00:41:57,485
<b>You're pretty considerate.</b>

401
00:42:03,371 --> 00:42:06,540
<b>You shortened the state affairs report time down to half,</b>

402
00:42:06,541 --> 00:42:08,500
<b>so I had no time to change my shoes.</b>

403
00:42:08,509 --> 00:42:11,395
<b>Your reports last for an average of 18 minutes,</b>

404
00:42:11,512 --> 00:42:13,680
<b>so I believe 30 minutes is enough.</b>

405
00:42:13,681 --> 00:42:15,110
<b>Shall we begin then?</b>

406
00:42:15,116 --> 00:42:17,505
<b>Should we shorten five more minutes since we're busy?</b>

407
00:42:19,453 --> 00:42:23,575
<b>Like I said in my written report, the country is peaceful,</b>

408
00:42:24,025 --> 00:42:25,915
<b>and the people are happy.</b>

409
00:42:26,694 --> 00:42:29,385
<b>And they'll be happier when they see our photo.</b>

410
00:42:38,372 --> 00:42:40,195
<b>It is all thanks to you.</b>

411
00:42:46,547 --> 00:42:49,065
<b>I'm thinking of learning horse riding as well.</b>

412
00:42:49,283 --> 00:42:51,150
<b>Do you think I'd do well, Your Majesty?</b>

413
00:42:51,152 --> 00:42:53,975
<b>When you learn to ride, this is what you hear first.</b>

414
00:42:54,488 --> 00:42:56,815
<b>"If you have trained honestly every time,</b>

415

<b>your horse will take you to the edge of the world."</b>

416
00:43:03,598 --> 00:43:06,855
<b>Prime Minister, are you honest?</b>

417
00:43:09,403 --> 00:43:11,270
<b>I received your report,</b>

418
00:43:11,272 --> 00:43:14,295
<b>and we took enough photos, so shall we end it here?</b>

419
00:43:14,942 --> 00:43:18,435
<b>I have to get washed up for my next schedule.</b>

420
00:43:27,788 --> 00:43:30,045
<b>Oh, my gosh!</b>

421
00:43:36,297 --> 00:43:38,615
<b>You nearly gave me a heart attack!</b>

422
00:43:38,966 --> 00:43:40,525
<b>This is treason.</b>

423
00:43:41,435 --> 00:43:43,900
<b>You should hurry. You might be late.</b>

424
00:43:43,904 --> 00:43:45,895
<b>What will you do if I'm not late?</b>

425
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:48,625
<b>And how long have you been standing there?</b>

426
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:51,270
<b>Do you really want to know?</b>

427
00:43:51,278 --> 00:43:53,110
<b>You're getting beheaded for sure.</b>

428
00:43:53,114 --> 00:43:55,580
<b>This is when we say, "You reap what you sow."</b>

429
00:43:55,583 --> 00:43:57,475
<b>You bolt like this all the time.</b>

430
00:43:57,618 --> 00:44:00,645
<b>And I don't know if you've dug some kind of tunnel in your bathroom.</b>

431
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:02,990
<b>How can you say "bolt" to your King?</b>

432
00:44:02,990 --> 00:44:06,060
<b>As you ordered, we got rid of the term "single-parent family."</b>

433

<b>And the banners.</b>

434
00:44:06,961 --> 00:44:08,645
<b>Yes, good job.</b>

435
00:44:09,930 --> 00:44:13,025
<b>But how can you talk like that to your King?</b>

436
00:44:13,601 --> 00:44:15,460
<b>Everything here is mine.</b>

437
00:44:15,469 --> 00:44:17,995
<b>Get it? It's all mine!</b>

438
00:44:23,844 --> 00:44:25,565
<b>You know that now, don't you?</b>

439
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:28,680
<b>Hey, Unbreakable Sword. Aren't you going to answer me?</b>

440
00:44:28,683 --> 00:44:30,275

<b>She fell down and down.</b>

445
00:44:47,301 --> 00:44:49,625
<b>She was falling endlessly.</b>

446
00:44:50,037 --> 00:44:55,370
<b>She said in a loud voice, 'How many miles</b>

448
00:44:57,712 --> 00:45:00,235
<b>This is my favorite book.</b>

<b>The author was a mathematician, too.</b>

<b>How is it? Is it interesting?</b>

451

<b>-No! -No!</b>

<b>It's boring.</b>

<b>I've never seen anyone talk so honestly to me since I became King.</b>

<b>Your Majesty, do you have a girlfriend?</b>

<b>This is what we really need to ask.</b>

<b>Oh, no.</b>

<b>Are you saying you saw a rabbit or a clock?</b>

<b>I was busy organizing my team's schedules.</b>

<b>These aren't my shoes.</b>

<b>Will you feel better if I do?</b>

530

<b>I'm really going to get a warning if you don't listen.</b>

<b>You're the captain. Who would give you a warning?</b>

<b>My sense of duty.</b>

534
00:51:54,561 --> 00:51:56,385
<b>You just made it really awkward.</b>

535
00:51:57,564 --> 00:52:00,800
<b>We caught all the men who caused the scene at the competition.</b>

536
00:52:00,801 --> 00:52:03,695
<b>And we're looking for the White Rabbit with the clock you saw.</b>

<b>Don't do what?</b>

541
00:52:28,295 --> 00:52:31,655
<b>Why do you want to catch the culprit yourself?</b>

542

<b>Do you want to get a Brave Citizen Award?</b>

543

<b>Why would I catch the culprit?</b>

544
00:52:35,402 --> 00:52:38,495
<b>You should be catching the culprit as the captain of the Royal Guards.</b>

545
00:52:42,509 --> 00:52:44,765
<b>I'm not catching anyone. I'm just trying to find</b>

<b>When it happened 25 years ago,</b>

554
00:53:14,274 --> 00:53:15,765
<b>I'm not sure.</b>

555
00:53:16,877 --> 00:53:19,965
