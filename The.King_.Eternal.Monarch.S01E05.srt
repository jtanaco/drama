1
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:15,980
JEONG TAE-EUL

2
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:17,860
I'm bored, let's play pool.

3
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,780
EPISODE 5

4
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:28,790
Thank you for your kindness.

5
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:31,080
I should repay you in cash,

6
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,960
but our worlds had different bills,
so I got you goods instead.

7
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:39,710
I hope you can get a satisfactory price.

8
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:46,590
Where did you get this?

9
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,680
Did you find oil in your yard
or something?

10
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:57,860
Oh, Sin-jae.

11
00:00:57,940 --> 00:00:59,610
Can I get a sweet milk tea?

12
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:02,900
I guess Squad Three is off duty tomorrow.

13
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:04,820
Yes, I was thinking of playing pool.

14
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:07,910
I don't see the horse that was here.

15
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:10,240
Maximus? It's been gone for a while.

16
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:16,580
Everyone's been asking,
so I even wrote it on the sign out front.

17
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:24,470
But Tae-eul isn't here.

18
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:26,840
Who are you playing pool with?

19
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,390
-She's not here?
-Maybe she's back.

20
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:33,640
She left with that King guy a while ago.

21
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:38,940
THE HORSE ISN'T HERE

22
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:49,070
I'M BORED, LET'S PLAY POOL

23
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:52,120
Head Court Lady Noh, it's me.

24
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,790
His Majesty just came back,
and he has a guest.

25
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,040
It's a woman.

26
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:03,880
Tell His Majesty to take a detour,

27
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:05,970
and use the sea route.

28
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:09,300
He shouldn't be seen by people.

29
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:12,970
Don't worry about the palace,
I'll make sure nobody talks.

30
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:23,360
FOUR TIGER SWORD

31
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:36,410
I'm the King of the Kingdom of Corea.

32
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:41,210
And my name, which you cannot say,

33
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:45,760
is Lee Gon.

34
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:54,850
So

35
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,640
you do have a name.

36
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,860
If you really have a name,

37
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:08,070
I guess there's no way
to avoid a beheading now.

38
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,830
From the way you talked to me so far,
it's only right to behead you right away.

39
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,250
-I'll escort you to the palace.
-Let me take care of Maximus first.

40
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:26,170
The trip had been too long for her age.

41
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:28,460
Come to the racetracks.

42
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:35,760
Withdraw the guards from the racetracks
right now.

43
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,220
Two of you go to the control room
and get the security footage.

44
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:39,230
The rest, follow me.

45
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,380
What is this place?

46
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:10,840
Is it some kind of a fourth dimension?

47
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,300
I'm not sure yet.

48
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:17,220
I guess we can say it's something between
1 and 0 in my world and yours.

49
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:21,270
This is a place that cannot be
explained scientifically.

50
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:27,360
Do you see that balloon?

51
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:31,150
Balloons usually pop within ten hours.

52
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,530
But that one has been floating
like that for over ten days.

53
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:37,660
It hasn't popped or floated away.

54
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:40,370
It's exactly where I let it go.

55
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:44,870
That means there's no light,
wind or air here.

56
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:46,790
Isn't that amazing?

57
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,750
If it's not science, what is it?

58
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,420
Is it some kind of magic?

59
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,510
It could be a part of a legend.

60
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:59,140
Time flows differently here as well.

61
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,890
One minute here is about an hour outside.

62
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,140
My watch stops here,

63
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,900
so I went back and forth
for several days to check.

64
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:10,780
How could you check when clocks stop here?

65
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,780
I used Euler's number.

66
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,780
I don't know how deep

67
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:21,290
or how vast this place is.

68
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:24,830
I'll reach the edge of this place someday.

69
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:26,500
And I'll tell you

70
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:28,420
all about it.

71
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:30,630
But for today, let's go to my world.

72
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:48,060
Lady Maximus has a lower blood pressure
than last time,

73
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:51,650
but it's still within a normal range.

74
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:53,570
"Lady"?

75
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:57,490
A horse is called a lady...

76
00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:00,530
I will do another thorough checkup
in the morning, Your Majesty.

77
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,290
Please do.

78
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:15,760
I told you so. Everything I said to you
was true, wasn't it?

79
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:19,930
Don't you see that's driving me crazy?

80
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,970
If this is all real, it's terrifying.

81
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,930
And if it's not, that means I'm crazy.

82
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,230
You should watch your manners.

83
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:28,940
And that face.

84
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,520
He is supposed to be on my side.

85
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:32,770
He's been on my side since I was three.

86
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:37,400
Is that gun real?

87
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:39,450
Can I take a look at it?

88
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,790
She knows how to handle it. Let her be.

89
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:49,580
She has to see for herself to believe it.

90
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:50,830
Believe what?

91
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:53,250
That she just crossed between 1 and 0.

92
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:04,850
No way.

93
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,430
This is real?

94
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:09,560
This P30

95
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,100
is actually real?

96
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,820
I'm going to check something.

97
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,320
It's nothing personal.

98
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:32,960
I told you. She can handle guns.

99
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:35,630
I'm letting this go just this once
because you're His Majesty's guest.

100
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:38,510
So...

101
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:40,130
This country...

102
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,130
And you being the King.

103
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:44,510
It's all real?

104
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:46,100
It's all real.

105
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,600
That gun, this world, and me.

106
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:54,060
So don't think of confirming that
by pulling the trigger.

107
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:58,360
This guy isn't going to move an inch.

108
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,150
Loosen your grip

109
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:03,320
unless you want to get killed.

110
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:20,970
Your Majesty, is she...

111
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:22,050
Yes.

112
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:24,550
She's Lieutenant Jeong Tae-eul.

113
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:28,260
Do you

114
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,020
know me as well?

115
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:55,040
Welcome to my palace.

116
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,140
This is Gwangyeongjeon.

117
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,730
It's my private residence.

118
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,230
Make yourself at home...

119
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:21,980
Did you really have to do this?

120
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:25,400
Are you trying to worry me to death?

121
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:27,370
Head Court Lady Noh...

122
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,280
I think it has only been
about 10 minutes and 50 seconds

123
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:32,500
since she believed I'm a king.

124
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:36,960
She's the important person who knows

125
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:39,090
where the buttons came from.

126
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:44,380
It's nice to meet you. I'm--

127
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:48,510
Put all your belongings here in the box.

128
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,770
Everyone has to go through
a security check when entering the palace.

129
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:58,560
Everyone including the court ladies
and even the Prime Minister.

130
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,740
You reap what you sow.

131
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:21,500
You're giving them back
to me later, right?

132
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,710
I'll be penalized
if I lose my ID card again.

133
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:29,680
You recognize her face, right?

134
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,510
You're right.

135
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:38,230
Do I have to get frisked now?

136
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:39,810
We'll skip that.

137
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,690
I should trust you.

138
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:44,110
You're my King's guest.

139
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:49,910
Let me talk to you for a moment.

140
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:51,370
Now?

141
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:57,620
I'm sure you want to talk later.

142
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:01,750
But I also would have liked it
if you had left the palace later

143
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:07,170
and brought a guest according
to the right procedures later.

144
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:11,930
There were five guards and one person
at the stable who saw her.

145
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:15,470
Twelve court ladies who would be
suspicious of being

146
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,140
-dismissed suddenly--
-I was on my way.

147
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:21,100
I needed to talk now anyway.

148
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:27,280
You should leave, too.

149
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:29,400
It's a King's order.

150
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:40,160
Don't worry.

151
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:42,120
Just wait here.

152
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:45,290
I'll ditch her somehow and come back.

153
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:47,840
My goodness...

154
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:50,340
You're really asking for it, aren't you?

155
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:55,930
I mean,

156
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,680
Your Highness.

157
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:05,770
I guess that was the wrong thing to say.

158
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:10,190
She really believes it now.

159
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:13,490
That I'm the King.

160
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:26,210
My goodness, my head.

161
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,000
Oh, my heart.

162
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:30,300
My goodness.

163
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:10,380
You have a meeting at 8 a.m.
regarding the 25th anniversary

164
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:12,170
of your coronation with the staff.

165
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:16,090
And you have an appointment for tea
at 10 a.m. with press company CEOs,

166
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:18,350
then you must make the first throw
at the basketball

167
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:19,760
season-opening ceremony at 1 p.m.

168
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:20,810
Hang on.

169
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:23,390
I left the palace for just half a day,

170
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:25,350
and I have that many things to do?

171
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:28,900
Maybe someone in the court
has a grudge on you.

172
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:33,280
-Is there more?
-Yes.

173
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:35,650
You have a speech to deliver at 2 p.m.

174
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:37,200
at the International Congress of
Mathematicians.

175
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:40,620
Then there is a flood relief supply
delivery ceremony at 4 p.m.

176
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,620
You can go there by helicopter.

177
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:43,790
All right.

178
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,460
I'll do all that,

179
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,330
so please let me eat dinner freely.

180
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:51,300
It's always suspicious
when you do something on your own.

181
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:53,010
You're crossing the line now.

182
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,590
I'll be eating by myself in the study.

183
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:57,720
Alone.

184
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,140
There is a guest in His Majesty's study.

185
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:06,020
You must keep that guest

186
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:09,060
locked up in there
until I give other orders.

187
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:28,330
Ironically, my first duty as a king

188
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:30,710
was to carry out
the funeral of the former king.

189
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,380
It was when I was eight.

190
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:48,440
I'm positive now

191
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,690
that it's a parallel universe.

192
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:53,690
Pardon?

193
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:56,150
Na-ri.

194
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:58,700
Myeong Na-ri.

195
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:00,660
Who's Myeong Na-ri?

196
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:04,790
I'm Myeong Seung-a
from the Royal Public Affairs Office.

197
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:17,380
I know it won't be true,

198
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:19,680
but I just want to make sure.

199
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:22,010
Don't you own a building?

200
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:25,010
Didn't you rent it out
to a Taekwondo center?

201
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:31,270
I do own buildings,
but they're all in Canada.

202
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:34,400
Would you like some tea?

203
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,280
It's herb tea that will help you
have a good night's sleep.

204
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,950
You want me to fall asleep?

205
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,530
I'd be grateful if you could.

206
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:46,660
I came here to keep an eye on you,

207
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:50,250
and you won't be able to leave
until Head Court Lady Noh says otherwise.

208
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:52,460
It will be easy for both of us
if you sleep.

209
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:56,380
You're really straightforward,

210
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:59,210
just like Na-ri.

211
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:02,340
I...

212
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:06,310
Can I use that laptop over there?

213
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,350
Of course not. You can't use His Majesty's
laptop without his permission.

214
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:15,650
-It's the year 2019 here, right?
-Yes.

215
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:18,530
And was this room's owner born in 1987?

216
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:20,110
Of course.

217
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:22,740
And the cultural capital is Busan,

218
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:25,240
and there are 63 buildings
called 63 Building.

219
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,120
There's only one 63 Building
in Yeouido, Seoul.

220
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,040
That little jerk.

221
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,040
Did you just swear at me?

222
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:37,630
What would be the better answer?

223
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,890
Can I have alcohol instead of tea?

224
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,720
I'd love some soju.

225
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:54,020
Your Majesty, where did you go this time?

226
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:56,520
A parallel universe.

227
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:24,880
Why do you need a laptop?

228
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:29,180
I wanted to look some stuff up
on the internet.

229
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,890
It's a business phone,
so I can't lend it to you.

230
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,110
But if you tell me,
I'll read out the search results for you.

231
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:41,650
I guess that will work.

232
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:45,450
All right. Then...

233
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:47,320
Lee Gon.

234
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:52,240
What did you just say?

235
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:53,620
Lee Gon.

236
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:56,830
Isn't the King's name Lee Gon?

237
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:57,880
Have you lost your mind?

238
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:01,170
Are you just casually
calling the King's name like that?

239
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:06,220
You don't even know the 63 Building,
and you don't know the King's age.

240
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:10,890
Who in the world are you?

241
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:13,640
Oh, did you live abroad for a long time?

242
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:15,730
But even so,

243
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:17,980
how could you be so indifferent
toward your home country?

244
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:19,900
Well...

245
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:22,900
This isn't my home country.

246
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,910
Well, my earth is still flat for me
so I can't explain.

247
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:32,450
Let's just say I'm an illegal immigrant.

248
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:35,620
Oh, my gosh.

249
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,550
Can you leave us? It won't take long.

250
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,970
She's an illegal immigrant.

251
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:02,110
Why are you smiling?

252
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:05,070
I know someone who looks like you,
but you're so different from him.

253
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,400
I'm sorry about earlier.

254
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,990
But were you always like this?

255
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:13,240
So prudent and serious?

256
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,240
Hold this.

257
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:18,910
I understand how you feel.
I went through that too.

258
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:37,270
I thought you'd need it,
so I made it easy for you.

259
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:39,060
I'm sure you won't find anything, though.

260
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:42,850
You can ask your boss why.

261
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:45,570
He's a science guy,
so he'd be better at explaining.

262
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:50,530
Are you

263
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:54,120
from a parallel universe?

264
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:56,160
Where the capital is Seoul,

265
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,330
and the country's name
is the Republic of Korea?

266
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,460
How do you know that?

267
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:08,210
Who are you?

268
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:11,380
What have you done to His Majesty?

269
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:15,010
Did you make that weird scar
on his shoulder too?

270
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,810
He has a scar on his shoulder?

271
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,730
I don't know anything about that.

272
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:25,610
We're not close enough to show
each other's backs.

273
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,360
And don't talk to me like that.

274
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,950
You were born in 1991, right?
I'm a year older than you.

275
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:37,740
Captain Jo.

276
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:59,810
I said I wanted the halls empty.

277
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,900
Your Majesty, I wanted to ask a few--

278
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:08,770
I know. I know you're curious

279
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:11,110
and I understand why you want
to check her fingerprints.

280
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:12,820
I'll send you a link.

281
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:14,740
It's about quantum mechanics.

282
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:17,490
Send me your questions by text
after reading it.

283
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:21,410
And will you open the door now?
The food is getting cold.

284
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,120
But Your Majesty.

285
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:26,920
Didn't you get any alcohol?

286
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:31,210
Your guest was asking for some.

287
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:35,050
Yeong.

288
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:36,090
Yes, Your Majesty.

289
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:40,220
Will you find out where the alcohol fridge
is located in the palace?

290
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:42,220
Pardon?

291
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:48,150
By the way,

292
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:50,820
when do you think His Majesty saw me?

293
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:53,400
I greeted him,

294
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:57,200
but he said we'd met before
and that he was glad to see me.

295
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,580
I had never met him before.

296
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:06,410
Was there anything notable
about the woman in there?

297
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:08,750
-Except that she asked for alcohol.
-You shouldn't ask me.

298
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:11,380
I'm only going to report
to Head Court Lady Noh.

299
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:15,510
You're good at your job.

300
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:17,880
I feel so sad about

301
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:19,470
missing this great opportunity.

302
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,010
I have to go meet Head Court Lady Noh.

303
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:24,890
I'll be off, then.

304
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,200
-Did you just lock me up in here?
-I'm housing you.

305
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,820
So be understanding.

306
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:43,740
I brought you here
without saying anything.

307
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:47,410
Everyone's in a panic
because this has never happened before.

308
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,920
Why are you so calm, then?

309
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:52,790
I imagined bringing you here
lots of times before.

310
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:54,300
Although it wasn't like this.

311
00:22:57,630 --> 00:23:00,050
Did you make a contract or something?
Did you buy land?

312
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:06,310
I stopped myself from wiping it
on the wall because of your citizens.

313
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:08,890
You should promote that employee
who was watching me.

314
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:10,020
She's a real patriot.

315
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:13,360
Let me borrow your phone,
and give it to me unlocked.

316
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:15,690
She wouldn't lend me her phone.

317
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:17,990
What are you going to look up?

318
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:20,200
I'm sure you have nowhere to call.

319
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:22,910
None of your business.

320
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,080
What's your passcode?

321
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,160
Who would even try to look
through a King's phone?

322
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:27,200
It's not locked.

323
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:34,840
Pass me the snack.

324
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,340
It's not a snack, it's dinner.

325
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:39,630
I thought you would be hungry.

326
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:43,260
You try it first.

327
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:47,560
-What?
-I'm not joking.

328
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:49,850
I'm Alice in Wonderland right now.

329
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:53,310
She eats weird pills
and grows bigger and smaller and stuff.

330
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:56,320
What if I eat this and die from poisoning
or natural causes and stuff?

331
00:23:57,650 --> 00:23:58,740
Don't worry.

332
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,490
I keep my promises.
You'll die from a beheading.

333
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,410
All right, then.

334
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:05,830
I'll enjoy the food.

335
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:16,500
You made this yourself?

336
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:19,260
Yes. Is it good?

337
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:21,050
No, it's bad.

338
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:27,850
I haven't done this for about 25 years,

339
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:29,890
but I should call my officials today.

340
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:33,140
In this world,
if I say "Anyone out there?",

341
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:35,560
everyone will come rushing...

342
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:38,900
Oh, gosh.

343
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,660
Were you really standing outside the door?

344
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:48,370
Do you think I have
that much time on my hands?

345
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:51,450
And you were here this whole time?

346
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:53,210
No, I came just a minute ago.

347
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:55,630
I barely sat down.

348
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:00,710
I prepared a bedroom and a meal
for your guest,

349
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:05,470
but since she seems to have eaten,
I will escort her to her room.

350
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,640
It is the farthest room from your room,
Your Majesty.

351
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:22,440
I'll see you tomorrow. Get some sleep.

352
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,370
I was talking to you.

353
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:33,000
You should really sleep well.

354
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:39,790
Is it far to the right
or to the left from my room?

355
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,380
My goodness!

356
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,480
Besides emergency situations,

357
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,560
outsiders hardly ever stay

358
00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:00,730
in the palace overnight.

359
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:06,650
So you must never speak
about what happened today

360
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:08,360
anywhere or to anyone.

361
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:14,040
You must keep everything a secret,
such as the structure of the palace

362
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:17,460
or the private conversations
you've had with the King.

363
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:19,830
You don't need to worry about that.

364
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:22,210
I'm a government official, too.

365
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,710
So I've seen.

366
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:27,510
Lieutenant Jeong Tae-eul.

367
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:34,430
I've been meaning to ask this.

368
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:36,640
How do you people

369
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:38,980
know me?

370
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:42,940
A lieutenant in the police force?

371
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,950
It is very strange.

372
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:53,240
His Majesty has had a strange ID card
since he was young.

373
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:59,580
There was no police officer named
Jeong Tae-eul in the Kingdom of Corea,

374
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,920
and there is no such rank
as a lieutenant in the police force here.

375
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:11,510
I thought that it was a fake ID
made as a joke or for some other reason,

376
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:14,640
but that nonexistent person

377
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,520
suddenly appeared here.

378
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:19,890
It's shocking.

379
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:24,480
Everything is just absurd,

380
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,900
but there is one thing I'm sure about.

381
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:32,070
An existence that cannot be explained
will only bring chaos to the world,

382
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:34,370
and it will only harm our King.

383
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:36,580
So

384
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:38,960
during your stay here,

385
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:43,380
please try to avoid contact

386
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:48,170
with anyone besides the King,
the Chief of the Royal Guard, and me.

387
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:53,510
Furthermore,
don't get curious about this world,

388
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:55,930
and don't try to stay.

389
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:00,690
And when I say "this world,"

390
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,520
that includes the King.

391
00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:12,300
I was right.

392
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:14,430
It was far to the right.

393
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,770
I thought you'd be glad to see me.

394
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:23,560
You came empty-handed?

395
00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:36,070
There's a bed and a sofa in here.
Why are you sitting on the floor?

396
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:39,530
There's a draft in here,
especially on the left side of the bed.

397
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:54,550
Why are you here?

398
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,680
I didn't want to leave you scared
all by yourself.

399
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:02,140
Trust me. I'm not a weird person here.

400
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:07,770
Why did you use the window
instead of the door if you're not weird?

401
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:10,940
You should know...

402
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,690
That's the shortcut.

403
00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:14,820
The palace is really big.

404
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:18,030
I thought you couldn't sit on the floor.

405
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:20,910
It's not so bad, actually.

406
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,700
And it feels kind of nice with the draft.

407
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:35,800
When are you going to show me my ID card?

408
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,180
-Tomorrow.
-Why tomorrow?

409
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:43,470
Were you just pretending to have it?

410
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:44,970
I do have it.

411
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,060
You might try to go back to your world

412
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,900
if I show you.

413
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,320
What is it?

414
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:01,740
What?

415
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:12,250
The doll on my car key.

416
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:14,550
It seems pretty cheap.

417
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:26,470
SHOOTING, ARCHERY

418
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,520
You can win this
if you hit the target seven times.

419
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,980
But if you've served in the military,

420
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:32,980
it'll be a piece of cake.

421
00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:35,940
It's 10,000 won for 10 bullets.
How many do you want?

422
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:37,320
I only need seven bullets.

423
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,550
You should really know,

424
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:01,840
nothing I have is cheap.

425
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:07,600
How much did you spend?

426
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:10,520
Anyone who's served in the military
can do it with their eyes closed.

427
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,520
I knew it.

428
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:14,770
Everyone in your country is a swindler.

429
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,900
Be quiet. There's someone
guarding the door outside.

430
00:32:18,990 --> 00:32:22,360
Are you stupid?
There are dozens of security cameras here.

431
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:29,080
Is that a security camera?

432
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:30,960
Wave to them.

433
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:33,460
Twelve people are watching us right now.

434
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:35,920
For real?

435
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:41,670
You believe everything I say now.

436
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:43,800
That was a lie.

437
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:48,220
Are you kidding me?

438
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:51,560
So

439
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:54,100
is that really a security camera or not?

440
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,690
It isn't. I was just joking.

441
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:01,240
You want proof?

442
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,040
Move.

443
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:14,500
This might look romantic,

444
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,130
but it's actually really uncomfortable.

445
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:20,340
No, it's not uncomfortable at all.

446
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:29,890
I'm going to ask you something,
so just answer with yes or no.

447
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:32,350
Okay.

448
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:34,980
You've never dated before, right?

449
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:38,190
You startled me.

450
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:40,980
Yes,

451
00:33:41,530 --> 00:33:42,400
I have.

452
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:44,530
Should I guess when?

453
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:46,450
Guess.

454
00:33:46,530 --> 00:33:47,370
Now.

455
00:33:54,290 --> 00:33:55,500
Should I have done this?

456
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,480
Try guessing what I just proved.

457
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:23,940
The fact that I've dated before?

458
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:25,400
Or

459
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:28,320
that I'm dating right now?

460
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:55,600
Did Squad Two find the weapon used
in their murder case?

461
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:58,310
Chief Choe is begging me to help him out.

462
00:34:58,850 --> 00:35:02,110
I just handed the information over.
It's a common kitchen knife.

463
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:03,860
Right.

464
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:06,070
It'd be about this size.

465
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:07,030
I see.

466
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:13,700
Here, here, and here.

467
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:17,250
And made sure the victim would die.

468
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,630
Why is the world so dark?

469
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:23,540
Let's live a bright life.

470
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:25,170
As bright as a light bulb.

471
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:30,680
I can't possibly be bright when
my husband is leaving home at this hour.

472
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:33,890
Come on, I don't want to leave.

473
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:36,970
But I can't help it.
Sin-jae asked for just one glass...

474
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,890
Don't make me work
after work hours have passed.

475
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:43,770
I can check your call records
within ten minutes.

476
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,360
Honey, wait. I'll push that.

477
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,280
No, I'll do it.

478
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:51,110
Honey, then could I put that in the car

479
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,990
and just take a taxi
in front of the building?

480
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:54,530
VIOLENT CRIMES DIVISION SQUAD 3

481
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:13,390
CHIEF PARK

482
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,640
I'm having a drink with you today.

483
00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:22,060
Who are you actually meeting, then?

484
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:27,190
Loneliness.

485
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:37,540
I'M BORED, LET'S PLAY POOL

486
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:52,880
I told you to sleep well,
but I guess you didn't.

487
00:36:54,970 --> 00:36:56,050
It's a Royal Guard uniform.

488
00:36:58,470 --> 00:36:59,890
You want me to run away in disguise?

489
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:02,390
I won't let you do that.

490
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:05,400
I have a full schedule today.

491
00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:07,730
Get dressed and come out.

492
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:09,360
We have to leave
without Head Court Lady Noh noticing.

493
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:14,780
If that was your plan,
you should've been more meticulous.

494
00:37:25,170 --> 00:37:27,500
My goodness, gracious.

495
00:37:28,170 --> 00:37:30,800
I made sure to separate you,
but you came here this early.

496
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:34,300
Right, I guess it's better for you
to go outside.

497
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,340
Come back as late as you can.

498
00:37:38,350 --> 00:37:40,640
And don't get any photos taken.
No photos together!

499
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:43,930
My goodness.

500
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:51,690
This was my plan all along.

501
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,900
I've succeeded.

502
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:58,450
You said you weren't a weird person here.

503
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:14,050
IT'S MY VERY FIRST TIME
SEEING HIS MAJESTY IN PERSON!

504
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:31,730
His Majesty will

505
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:34,860
make the first throw
for our victory today.

506
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:36,820
Please give a round of applause.

507
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:50,960
Please give a round of applause

508
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:54,880
and a loud cheer for the King
who did the first throw for us.

509
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:02,890
The architect Richard Fuller said,

510
00:39:02,970 --> 00:39:05,640
"When I find a solution to a problem,

511
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:10,650
I know that I am wrong if the solution
is not beautiful."

512
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:13,820
So I'm giving you this advice

513
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:18,900
as an amateur mathematician
and also as your King.

514
00:39:21,450 --> 00:39:22,280
WALK

515
00:39:22,370 --> 00:39:24,290
Leave your lab
for at least 30 minutes a day.

516
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:27,710
Your labs

517
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:29,960
need to be cleaned.

518
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:38,170
Get plenty of rest.

519
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:41,760
Your bodies are not infinite decimals.

520
00:39:43,010 --> 00:39:44,560
ATMOSPHERE

521
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:49,310
Share beautiful moments
with your lovers or family.

522
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:52,810
Even mathematicians can do it.

523
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:06,990
You are all proud mathematicians
of the Kingdom of Corea.

524
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,410
Whatever problem you are working on,

525
00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:12,960
I hope your solution and your answer

526
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:15,840
are both beautiful.

527
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,270
Wasn't I cool?

528
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:39,110
Yes, you were.

529
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:41,740
I think so, too.

530
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:43,820
I've thought that for a long time.

531
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:57,840
Captain Jo.

532
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,510
Please do as I requested.

533
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:06,850
Can you look this way, please?

534
00:41:14,810 --> 00:41:16,610
It doesn't seem to be a present.

535
00:41:16,730 --> 00:41:19,020
"I got you out of the palace
since you might stay locked up

536
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:20,570
in the study.

537
00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:22,490
Have fun. I'll see you in the evening."

538
00:41:24,570 --> 00:41:26,700
That is what His Majesty said.

539
00:41:27,490 --> 00:41:30,540
His Majesty has other duties to attend to,
so you're on your own now.

540
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:38,750
"Oh, thanks.

541
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:41,010
It's totally my style."

542
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:43,970
Tell him I said that.

543
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:47,680
But...

544
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:50,100
Do you have some money?

545
00:41:51,270 --> 00:41:54,690
I bought your boss
chicken and stuff in the other world.

546
00:42:07,450 --> 00:42:09,490
It takes about 50 minutes
to the disaster area.

547
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:12,290
The relief supplies
have been delivered by train.

Do you need any help?

00:43:07,170 --> 00:43:09,510
It's fine, just go.

556
00:43:10,050 --> 00:43:11,600
You should accept my help.

557
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:13,970
Did you receive the photos?

558
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:24,230
What are these? Did you send these?

559
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:26,610
Did you photoshop me?

560
00:43:27,530 --> 00:43:28,780
You're crazy.

561
00:43:29,990 --> 00:43:32,200
This must be a new scamming method,
but you've chosen the wrong person.

562
00:43:33,490 --> 00:43:37,790
I don't even have money
to buy pills to kill myself.

563
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:42,130
Born on July 12th, 1989.

How do you know my birthdate?

565
00:43:47,710 --> 00:43:50,380
The granddaughter of the founder
of a large pharmaceutical company.

Marries the first son of a rich family

567

after meeting him
at a yacht club in America.

568
00:43:56,930 --> 00:43:59,940
And the first baby
is born after four months.

569
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:03,980
This is your life.

570
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:07,530
If you want it to be.

571
00:44:11,610 --> 00:44:14,580
I've never chosen the wrong person.

572
00:44:16,030 --> 00:44:19,410
The woman in these photos is you.

573
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:21,870
To be exact,

574
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,460
it's you in another world.

575
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:27,590
In this world,

576
00:44:30,970 --> 00:44:33,140
you're living in hell.

577
00:44:52,570 --> 00:44:54,030
How did you get these photos?

578
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:57,280
Did you come into my house?

579
00:44:57,370 --> 00:44:59,330
You have a useless lock,

580
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:02,750
a window with no sunlight coming through,

581
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:05,710
and walls that can't protect you
from the cold nor the heat.

582
00:45:06,290 --> 00:45:07,840
Is that house any different

583
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:09,550
from a grave?

584
00:45:11,010 --> 00:45:12,720
How about giving your daughter

585
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:15,760
a house, a car,

586
00:45:16,430 --> 00:45:18,970
and parents like this?

587
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:24,520
Instead of used garbage like that.

588
00:45:28,190 --> 00:45:29,690
How do you know it's a girl?

589
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:34,360
You...

590
00:45:34,950 --> 00:45:37,950
Whether you're a swindler or a member
of a cult, you've got the wrong person.

591
00:45:38,030 --> 00:45:39,280
I'm sending you to jail.

592
00:45:40,990 --> 00:45:43,290
112 crime report. How may I help you?

593
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:49,250
Hello? You may speak.

594
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:58,180
Who are you?

595
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:00,970
Someone who's going to save your life.

596
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:02,850
How are you going to do that?

597
00:46:05,310 --> 00:46:06,940
What do I have to do

598
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:12,280
to get that?

599
00:46:13,490 --> 00:46:15,820
You just have to kill the other you.

600
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:19,700
All right, then...

601
00:46:23,370 --> 00:46:25,410
Would you like to change

602
00:46:26,370 --> 00:46:27,710
your miserable life?

603
00:46:30,630 --> 00:46:31,710
What are you going to do

604
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:33,300
if I say no?

605
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:35,340
I already saw your face.

606
00:46:37,340 --> 00:46:38,470
Am I going to die

607
00:46:39,470 --> 00:46:40,350
instead of

608
00:46:41,050 --> 00:46:41,890
her?

609
00:46:42,350 --> 00:46:44,560
Well, I haven't thought about that yet.

610
00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:50,060
Nobody has refused until now.

611
00:46:56,950 --> 00:46:57,950
It's okay

612
00:46:58,740 --> 00:47:00,990
for you to be the first exception.

613
00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:04,240
It'll be interesting to me.

614
00:47:07,410 --> 00:47:08,250
Wait.

615
00:47:08,580 --> 00:47:10,790
Wait...

616
00:47:14,250 --> 00:47:15,170
How

617
00:47:19,050 --> 00:47:20,970
should I contact you?

618
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:30,600
I'll be the one

619
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:32,770
to contact you.

620
00:47:36,150 --> 00:47:37,400
It's an urgent report from
the Ministry of National Defense.

621
00:47:37,990 --> 00:47:39,740
A Chinese fishing boat
sent a distress signal

622
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:41,700
in the intermediate zone of the East Sea.

623
00:47:41,780 --> 00:47:44,660
The Yi Sun-sin Destroyer
that was nearby received the signal.

624
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:46,910
Are they sure it's a fishing boat?

625
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,250
Yes, they confirmed it.

626
00:47:48,330 --> 00:47:51,750
They say it must've been stranded
because of the severe fog and swells.

627
00:47:51,830 --> 00:47:53,630
This happened last spring as well.

628
00:47:54,130 --> 00:47:56,710
The Japanese Navy
could interfere again, right?

629
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:59,840
Yes, after Japan broke off
the EEZ agreement,

630
00:47:59,930 --> 00:48:02,180
both Japan and China
are sensitive about such things.

631
00:48:02,430 --> 00:48:03,890
Let's just think simply.

632
00:48:04,050 --> 00:48:06,350
We'll be more aggressive
at the next negotiation with Japan,

633
00:48:06,430 --> 00:48:08,390
and rescue those people
since we got the signal.

634
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:12,400
And tell our people to ask them
why they keep fishing in our waters.

635
00:48:14,190 --> 00:48:15,110
Yes, ma'am.

636

CERTIFICATE OF APPOINTMENT
KOO SEO-RYEONG

637
00:48:30,370 --> 00:48:31,960
The King of the Kingdom of Corea

638
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:33,920
accepts the people's decision

639
00:48:34,540 --> 00:48:37,300
and allows Prime Minister Koo
to form the Cabinet.

640
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:44,720
I hope you become a Prime Minister
who values the citizens.

641
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:48,470
I will do my best, Your Majesty.

642
00:48:50,890 --> 00:48:53,480
What kind of Prime Minister
should I be to you?

643
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:59,530
Please be a Prime Minister
who mostly gives written reports.

644
00:49:09,450 --> 00:49:10,500
Prime Minister Koo.

645
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:12,500
I can never be indebted to you.

646
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:15,710
Let's wait and see how my absence
will be historically recorded

647
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:18,250
in the pages of history books.

My gosh, no way.

650
00:50:23,530 --> 00:50:24,400
Oh, I'm sorry.

651
00:50:24,490 --> 00:50:25,320
It's fine.

652
00:50:30,490 --> 00:50:32,790
KINGDOM OF COREA MAINTAINS
4TH HIGHEST GDP IN THE WORLD

653
00:50:33,370 --> 00:50:34,200
Fourth?

654
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:37,540
The Republic...

655
00:50:38,750 --> 00:50:41,210
I mean, the Kingdom of Corea's
GDP is that high?

656
00:50:41,290 --> 00:50:44,050
We export rare-earth elements
internationally.

657
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:45,920
It's even in school textbooks.

658
00:50:47,130 --> 00:50:49,890
I'm sorry, but what are
rare-earth elements?

659
00:50:50,470 --> 00:50:52,140
It's always mentioned in exams.

660
00:50:52,310 --> 00:50:54,310
Cerium, lanthanum, yttrium, samarium...

661
00:50:57,100 --> 00:50:58,230
Are you a foreigner?

662
00:51:00,940 --> 00:51:02,770
Yeah, something like that.

663
00:51:03,940 --> 00:51:06,030
So, what are they?

664
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:07,900
Well, they're minerals.

665
00:51:08,530 --> 00:51:12,080
There are 30 million tons
just in the northern area, and in the sea.

666
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:15,830
Anyway, those minerals in the northern
area are worth 20 billion dollars a ton,

667
00:51:15,910 --> 00:51:18,160
so it'd be about six quintillion dollars.

668
00:51:18,250 --> 00:51:22,090
And that's all owned
by the Kingdom of Corea?

669
00:51:22,170 --> 00:51:23,420
Oh, no.

670
00:51:24,130 --> 00:51:26,630
The mountains where they're buried
are owned by the royal court,

671
00:51:27,670 --> 00:51:29,300
so they're actually the King's.

672
00:51:35,850 --> 00:51:36,930
It's a diamond?

673
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:40,440
If that's a diamond, I'm Princess Diana.

674
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:42,360
A king?

675
00:51:42,860 --> 00:51:45,780
You're a total nutjob.
This is so ridiculous.

676
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:51,160
ROYAL COURT OF KINGDOM OF COREA

677
00:51:52,490 --> 00:51:54,410
You're really one
or the other, aren't you?

678
00:52:07,510 --> 00:52:10,340
CTX MOUNT KUMGANG NATIONAL PARK

CTX TRAINS
TO MOKPO TO MOUNT PAEKTU

681
00:52:23,730 --> 00:52:25,070
The CTX train

682
00:52:25,770 --> 00:52:29,860
bound for Pyongyang is ready to depart
on platform number three.

683
00:52:30,610 --> 00:52:31,450
BUSAN STATION TO SEOUL STATION

684
00:52:31,530 --> 00:52:34,450
Passengers, please check the ticket

685
00:52:34,530 --> 00:52:36,700
and board the train immediately.

686
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:39,330
Sir. Over there.

687
00:52:44,710 --> 00:52:47,250
Hey, look who it is. Isn't that Luna?

688
00:52:48,050 --> 00:52:49,460
She even changed her hairstyle.

689
00:52:50,050 --> 00:52:51,130
-Hey.
-Yes, sir.

690
00:52:51,220 --> 00:52:52,380
-Get her.
-Yes, sir.

691
00:52:55,470 --> 00:52:57,850
Who are you to block my way?
Do you have a death wish?

692
00:52:58,010 --> 00:52:59,390
You're...

693
00:52:59,470 --> 00:53:00,600
Yes, I'm Jo Yeong.

694
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:02,980
You got out quickly.

695
00:53:04,150 --> 00:53:06,610
-What did you say that woman's name was?
-Luna.

696
00:53:07,190 --> 00:53:08,860
You know, the one
we were chasing last time.

697
00:53:08,940 --> 00:53:09,940
Are you sure?

698
00:53:10,030 --> 00:53:11,440
She took off with our boss' money

699
00:53:11,530 --> 00:53:13,910
and even got a new hairstyle with it.
How could we forget her?

700
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:16,570
Our boss is still in jail because of her.

701
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:18,910
-But that bitch is wandering around--
-All right. Get lost.

702
00:53:19,490 --> 00:53:20,700
She's my guest for now.

703
00:53:20,790 --> 00:53:22,250
Don't make me repeat myself.

704
00:53:54,030 --> 00:53:55,570
Prime Minister, you're so pretty!

705
00:53:55,660 --> 00:53:56,910
You're so pretty!

706
00:53:57,160 --> 00:53:58,870
Prime Minister, you're so pretty!

707
00:53:58,950 --> 00:54:02,580
RELATIVE SEARCH RESULTS TO LEE GON,
LEE GON AND KOO SEO-RYEONG MARRIAGE

708
00:54:02,660 --> 00:54:04,410
Prime Minister, make sure to eat well.

709
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:06,000
-Love you all!
-Me too, Prime Minister!

710
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:07,250
Stay healthy!

711
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:16,010
You're six months pregnant,
but you still look slim.

712
00:54:16,180 --> 00:54:18,220
I watch my figure even more than
before I got married.

713
00:54:18,340 --> 00:54:19,930
My husband didn't want me to gain weight.

714
00:54:20,050 --> 00:54:21,850
Right, don't end up like me.

715
00:54:22,310 --> 00:54:23,930
My husband cheated on me

716
00:54:24,230 --> 00:54:25,890
when I was seven months pregnant.

717
00:54:29,190 --> 00:54:30,230
Excuse me.

718
00:54:30,730 --> 00:54:32,110
I guess Seo-ryeong is coming.

719
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:35,030
I've just lost my appetite.
Did she have to come?

720
00:54:35,610 --> 00:54:36,650
I'm leaving first.

721
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:38,280
-You're leaving?
-Yeah.

722
00:54:46,750 --> 00:54:47,670
Did she just leave?

723
00:54:47,750 --> 00:54:49,420
She said she lost her appetite.

724
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:52,590
The food isn't even served yet.
That's nonsense.

725
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:53,960
Didn't you know?

726
00:54:54,050 --> 00:54:56,130
Congressman Park Cheol-ung,
the one involved in the sex scandal.

727
00:54:56,220 --> 00:54:57,510
He's her sister-in-law's brother-in-law.

728
00:54:57,590 --> 00:54:58,840
So what?

729
00:54:58,930 --> 00:55:00,550
I barely remember my sister-in-law's face.

730
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:03,600
Bad things keep happening
to people who oppose you.

731
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:08,350
Rumors say the only one
who benefits from the scandal is you.

732
00:55:08,850 --> 00:55:10,610
The person who benefits the most

733
00:55:11,020 --> 00:55:11,980
is usually the culprit.

734
00:55:12,570 --> 00:55:15,490
It's just that the people who oppose me
happen to have dark secrets.

735
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:19,530
My husband says Prince Buyeong
has your back.

736
00:55:19,990 --> 00:55:21,830
-Is that true?
-What if it is?

737
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:23,910
Does he want to take sides with me?

738
00:55:24,540 --> 00:55:25,580
Can he?

739
00:55:26,660 --> 00:55:28,460
Are the Royal Family your in-laws now?

740
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:30,580
Is that why you're serving another term?

741
00:55:30,710 --> 00:55:32,000
You really think she can?

742
00:55:32,420 --> 00:55:35,630
That "I studied while selling fish"
doesn't work anymore.

743
00:55:37,050 --> 00:55:39,180
A queen with no term limit is better

744
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:41,510
than a Prime Minister
with a five-year term.

745
00:55:41,590 --> 00:55:44,510
But I'm not sure
if His Majesty likes old women.

746
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:49,310
Do you want to see
if it still works or not?

747
00:55:50,850 --> 00:55:52,900
What will you do if the priority
for the remainder of my term

748
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:55,730
is to do a tax investigation into
your husband's company, Sungwoon Group?

749
00:55:57,030 --> 00:55:59,740
What'll you do
if I obsess over that like a lunatic?

750
00:56:03,030 --> 00:56:04,280
Aren't you going to leave?

751
00:56:05,490 --> 00:56:09,080
I don't think our conversation
will be good for your baby.

752
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,000
Auntie's sorry about that.

753
00:56:40,150 --> 00:56:43,490
SEOUL JONGNO POLICE STATION

754
00:56:59,550 --> 00:57:00,510
Excuse me.

755
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:06,180
Don't you know me?

756
00:57:07,180 --> 00:57:08,100
It's Jeong Tae-eul.

757
00:57:08,770 --> 00:57:09,680
Don't you know?

758
00:57:09,770 --> 00:57:10,770
Well...

759
00:57:11,060 --> 00:57:12,100
Do you know her?

760
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:18,110
No, I don't. Who are you?

761
00:57:18,190 --> 00:57:20,690
Then what about Kang Sin-jae? Or Jangmi?

762
00:57:20,940 --> 00:57:23,360
Or what about Director Kim Hee-ju
from Forensics?

763
00:57:23,450 --> 00:57:25,200
I'm not sure who they are.

764
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:27,910
The names sound like
they are kind-hearted people...

765
00:57:28,490 --> 00:57:29,450
What is this about?

766
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:31,250
Are you visiting the station?

767
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:34,580
Are you a detective?

768
00:57:37,630 --> 00:57:40,260
No, it's nothing. I guess I was mistaken.

769
00:57:41,590 --> 00:57:43,170
Enjoy your meal.

770
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:45,340
-All right.
-Oh, okay.

771
00:57:49,310 --> 00:57:52,230
You've been on the news
too often these days.

772
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:55,440
Yeah, I was so shocked.
I look so good on screen.

773
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:56,350
You looked so cool.

774
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:58,150
What do you want to eat?
I want ox bone soup.

775
00:57:58,230 --> 00:57:59,520
I want ox knee soup.

776
00:58:00,530 --> 00:58:04,700
Hey, but how did she know
we were on our way to eat?

777
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:12,950
Bye.

778
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,380
-Let's eat ox knee soup.
-All right. There's a place I know.

779
00:58:20,460 --> 00:58:24,170
It's been there for 50 years, and
the bone soup tastes just like knee soup.

780
00:58:24,260 --> 00:58:25,470
Don't be ridiculous.

781
00:58:44,610 --> 00:58:46,400
If he hasn't become a detective...

782
00:58:47,910 --> 00:58:48,780
Right...

783
00:58:49,530 --> 00:58:51,200
It means his family didn't get bankrupt.

784
00:58:52,540 --> 00:58:55,000
The Kang Sin-jae of the Kingdom of Corea

785
00:58:55,830 --> 00:58:56,830
is so cool.

786
00:59:00,590 --> 00:59:01,590
Wow.

787
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:20,000
Oh, hey.

788
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,330
I'm running into you often lately.

789
01:00:23,540 --> 01:00:24,750
And you're still eating sweets.

790
01:00:25,340 --> 01:00:28,300
I don't eat sweets that often,
but I keep getting caught eating them.

791
01:00:29,630 --> 01:00:32,140
-What are you doing in this neighborhood?
-I live around here.

792
01:00:34,300 --> 01:00:36,390
Well, I used to live around here.

793
01:00:38,100 --> 01:00:39,480
I guess you're having a gathering today.

794
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:42,850
I'm just going to have some drinks.

795
01:00:43,270 --> 01:00:45,230
This won't be enough
if I start drinking in the daytime.

796
01:00:45,650 --> 01:00:47,020
Do you want one?

797
01:00:56,530 --> 01:00:58,950
Is it okay for a psychiatrist
to be an alcoholic?

798
01:01:00,870 --> 01:01:03,040
I'm not that dependent.
I have a high alcohol tolerance.

799
01:01:04,580 --> 01:01:06,340
But are sweets really effective?

800
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:10,880
It's just nice
because it's sweet and melts fast.

801
01:01:10,970 --> 01:01:13,430
Isn't it better for it to melt
slowly if it's sweet?

802
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:14,800
It's going to melt anyway.

803
01:01:18,390 --> 01:01:19,930
By the way, what's your job?

804
01:01:21,180 --> 01:01:24,440
I thought I'd ask you at the next session,
but you didn't come.

805
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:28,520
-I'm a detective.
-Really?

806
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:31,110
I guessed totally wrong.

807
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:34,820
-I thought you were a gangster.
-What kind of psychiatrist...

808
01:01:36,570 --> 01:01:37,910
That's why the meds didn't work.

809
01:01:37,990 --> 01:01:39,830
You probably didn't even take them.

810
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,920
When did you move away
from this neighborhood?

811
01:01:44,330 --> 01:01:47,170
I've always lived here,
so we could've run into each other...

812
01:01:51,170 --> 01:01:54,930
Yes. I told you that my family
got bankrupt when I was little.

813
01:01:56,590 --> 01:01:58,180
We moved out when I was in middle school.

814
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:02,180
The house prices here
went up a lot, right?

815
01:02:02,730 --> 01:02:05,600
I visit here sometimes,
but I feel so bitter.

816
01:02:07,650 --> 01:02:10,610
What do you think makes you
keep returning to this place?

817
01:02:12,650 --> 01:02:14,900
Do you still have
the same recurring nightmares?

818
01:02:18,410 --> 01:02:20,080
Don't start a session
so suddenly like this.

819
01:02:20,950 --> 01:02:22,660
Especially when you're drinking.

820
01:02:23,080 --> 01:02:24,710
You're treating me like some quack.

821
01:02:27,380 --> 01:02:28,880
All right, let's just drink then.

822
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:47,560
I'M BORED, LET'S PLAY POOL

823
01:02:49,940 --> 01:02:50,980
Jeong who?

824
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:52,440
SUIM ORIENTAL CLINIC

825
01:02:52,530 --> 01:02:54,110
Jeong Do-in.

826
01:02:54,610 --> 01:02:57,910
He's a Taekwondo instructor
at a Taekwondo center.

827
01:02:58,530 --> 01:02:59,990
I don't know anyone by that name.

828
01:03:02,870 --> 01:03:04,200
Then...

829
01:03:07,540 --> 01:03:11,750
How about a woman named Ahn Bong-hui?

830
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:13,840
Do you know her?

831
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:15,920
Her face looks really similar to mine.

832
01:03:16,130 --> 01:03:18,470
Have you ever seen her?

833
01:03:19,340 --> 01:03:20,550
Ahn Bong-hui?

834
01:03:21,550 --> 01:03:22,560
No, I haven't.

835
01:03:23,140 --> 01:03:25,100
We've lived here for 30 years.

836
01:03:25,730 --> 01:03:27,850
Why? Did they say they live here?

837
01:03:29,100 --> 01:03:30,860
No, never mind. Thank you.

838
01:03:43,870 --> 01:03:45,160
It's 41,800 won.

839
01:03:45,290 --> 01:03:46,330
Oh, right. One second.

840
01:03:56,550 --> 01:03:58,920
I'm sorry, but how much
is a standing ticket?

841
01:04:00,050 --> 01:04:01,430
It's 34,800 won.

842
01:04:05,930 --> 01:04:08,890
I rode a taxi
without thinking about the ticket.

843
01:04:09,890 --> 01:04:13,480
I'm sorry,
but is there a bus terminal in Gangnam?

844
01:04:14,110 --> 01:04:15,110
There's one in Songpa-gu.

845
01:04:15,860 --> 01:04:18,780
But even if you go now,
you'd miss the last bus.

846
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:20,530
Don't you have a card?

847
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:29,290
I'm telling you, it's not a prank call!

848
01:04:29,370 --> 01:04:30,790
I really know Lee Gon...

849
01:04:33,330 --> 01:04:35,630
I mean, the King... I know the King.

850
01:04:36,130 --> 01:04:38,170
Okay? I'm an acquaintance.

851
01:04:38,510 --> 01:04:39,380
I...

852
01:04:44,100 --> 01:04:45,640
I'm really serious.

853
01:04:46,760 --> 01:04:48,810
I just need to talk to him for one minute.

854
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:55,900
I'm short of 2,600 won,

855
01:04:56,730 --> 01:04:59,360
so I can't return to Busan right now.

856
01:05:04,700 --> 01:05:05,660
Just ten seconds.

857
01:05:05,740 --> 01:05:08,290
Please, just ten seconds. I...

858
01:05:15,840 --> 01:05:16,710
Who

859
01:05:18,300 --> 01:05:20,010
did you say it was just now?

860
01:05:21,300 --> 01:05:22,260
Well, Your Majesty,

861
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:25,390
some woman called
the Royal Court's main number

862
01:05:25,470 --> 01:05:27,470
seventeen times, asking for you.

863
01:05:28,390 --> 01:05:30,270
-The security team was checking--
-No,

864
01:05:31,480 --> 01:05:33,140
I mean the name of the caller.

865
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:36,730
Well, she said she was Princess Diana.

866
01:05:37,190 --> 01:05:39,780
They tracked her location just in case,
and she's at Seoul Station.

867
01:05:42,320 --> 01:05:43,240
Turn the helicopter.

868
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:45,280
We're going to Seoul.

869
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:47,280
Pardon?

870
01:05:47,370 --> 01:05:50,160
Check Captain Jo's location right now.

871
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:51,160
Yes, Your Majesty.

872
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:14,390
Oh, my gosh.

873
01:06:17,100 --> 01:06:18,110
What are you doing here?

874
01:06:18,190 --> 01:06:19,730
I received orders from the King.

875
01:06:20,730 --> 01:06:22,780
He said you must be kept alive
until your beheading.

876
01:06:26,910 --> 01:06:29,450
But do you even really behead people here?

877
01:06:30,080 --> 01:06:33,040
It hasn't happened since 1920, but...

878
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:36,790
it seems like it could happen again soon.

879
01:06:36,870 --> 01:06:38,130
My gosh.

880
01:06:40,420 --> 01:06:41,670
Who are you, really?

881
01:06:42,210 --> 01:06:43,380
Are you really a detective?

882
01:06:44,470 --> 01:06:46,380
Why did you go
to the police station earlier?

883
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:49,850
Were you following me?

884
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:52,430
Follow me.

885
01:07:43,650 --> 01:07:44,650
I heard you were looking for me.

886
01:07:45,860 --> 01:07:46,740
Yes.

887
01:07:46,820 --> 01:07:47,950
Seventeen times.

888
01:07:48,860 --> 01:07:49,780
Yes.

889
01:07:49,860 --> 01:07:51,700
I thought you were going to stay in Busan.

890
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:53,700
Why did you come so far?

891
01:07:55,620 --> 01:07:57,330
Did you get to find Ahn Bong-hui?

892
01:07:57,620 --> 01:07:58,620
How did you know?

893
01:08:01,750 --> 01:08:03,880
Since when were you following me?

894
01:08:04,040 --> 01:08:06,260
You should have lent me money
if you were there all along.

895
01:08:07,880 --> 01:08:08,800
Who is she?

896
01:08:09,430 --> 01:08:12,050
Who are you looking for in this world?

897
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:17,770
My mom.

898
01:08:19,890 --> 01:08:21,440
If this is a parallel world...

899
01:08:22,190 --> 01:08:25,150
And since Na-ri and Eun-sup are both here,

900
01:08:26,780 --> 01:08:28,860
although I might not exist...

901
01:08:31,110 --> 01:08:32,700
my mother could still be alive.

902
01:08:34,330 --> 01:08:35,910
I know she is someone else,

903
01:08:37,620 --> 01:08:39,460
but I didn't want her to be sick
in this world.

904
01:08:40,540 --> 01:08:43,750
I only have memories of her
from when I was five.

905
01:08:46,170 --> 01:08:47,880
So I just wanted to watch her from afar.

906
01:08:48,590 --> 01:08:49,970
That's why I came here.

907
01:08:52,180 --> 01:08:53,590
You should have told me.

908
01:08:54,510 --> 01:08:55,720
I was just curious.

909
01:08:56,760 --> 01:08:57,890
But she wasn't there.

910
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:00,390
Anyway...

911
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:03,730
I had fun today because of you.

912
01:09:04,310 --> 01:09:05,730
Is that why you searched for KTX?

913
01:09:06,360 --> 01:09:07,820
I was wondering what KTX is.

914
01:09:09,190 --> 01:09:10,610
Search?

915
01:09:13,110 --> 01:09:14,240
He didn't tell me that.

916
01:09:14,910 --> 01:09:16,580
The auto-save function told me.

917
01:09:17,620 --> 01:09:19,620
You were curious about a lot of things.

918
01:09:20,370 --> 01:09:22,410
Why were you curious about
Lee Gon's ex-girlfriend?

919
01:09:23,080 --> 01:09:24,500
Didn't you think
that I never had a girlfriend?

920
01:09:26,710 --> 01:09:29,090
Why would you read that?

921
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:30,670
That's cheating.

922
01:09:32,840 --> 01:09:34,510
Your Majesty, Prime Minister Koo is--

923
01:09:34,590 --> 01:09:37,140
Right. You looked up
Prime Minister Koo as well.

924
01:09:37,220 --> 01:09:38,760
That was because...

925
01:09:39,470 --> 01:09:43,270
Because I heard she was
the youngest female Prime Minister.

926
01:09:43,350 --> 01:09:45,810
I only looked up her name
because I was amazed by that.

927
01:09:47,310 --> 01:09:48,730
Why? Do you feel guilty?

928
01:09:48,820 --> 01:09:50,320
I meet her every Friday.

929
01:09:51,900 --> 01:09:52,820
Is she IU?

930
01:10:00,410 --> 01:10:01,790
Yes, it's Prime Minister Koo.

931
01:10:02,410 --> 01:10:05,830
She probably got a report
that your helicopter landed in Seoul.

932
01:10:35,860 --> 01:10:38,410
I'm seeing you at an unexpected hour,
in an unexpected place,

933
01:10:39,830 --> 01:10:41,410
with an unexpected person, Your Majesty.

934
01:10:42,240 --> 01:10:43,120
You're right.

935
01:10:43,620 --> 01:10:45,620
And you've put me in an awkward situation.

936
01:10:47,790 --> 01:10:48,630
Nice to meet you.

937
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:52,090
I'm Koo Seo-ryeong,
Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Corea.

938
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:52,400
