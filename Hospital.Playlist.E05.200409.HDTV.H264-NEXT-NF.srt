4

<b>-Sorry?
-It's child abuse, isn't it?</b>

5

<b>I think so.
These aren't bruises from a car accident.</b>

<b>Besides,
the bruises have different colors.</b>

7

<b>The bruises from long ago are lighter,</b>

8

9

17

23

<b>His father said he broke his arm,</b>

24

he had broken ribs as well.</b>

<b>Tell me.</b>

39

<b>The doctor suspects you've been

<b>Are they supposed to be gods or what?</b>

41

<b>Do they know everything that's happened?</b>

42
00:03:42,644 --> 00:03:45,397
<b>They're my children. Okay?</b>

43
00:03:45,772 --> 00:03:48,525
<b>They're my children, so I know better.</b>

44
00:03:48,984 --> 00:03:52,362
<b>They only saw them for ten minutes.
What do they know?</b>

45
00:03:52,445 --> 00:03:55,699
<b>If you think it's unfair,
you can explain yourself at the station.</b>

46
00:03:56,241 --> 00:03:58,493
<b>-Let's go already.
-About Jae-hun.</b>

47
00:04:02,998 --> 00:04:06,293
<b>He broke his arm when he fell off
the table yesterday.</b>

48
00:04:06,668 --> 00:04:10,422
<b>I saw the X-ray,
and his right rib was broken too.</b>

49
00:04:10,505 --> 00:04:12,841
<b>Yes, you're right. So what?</b>

50
00:04:12,924 --> 00:04:15,510
<b>It's because he fell on his right side.</b>

51
00:04:15,594 --> 00:04:17,679
<b>-So what?
-It's not every day</b>

52
00:04:17,762 --> 00:04:20,932
<b>that you see someone break their arms
and ribs just from falling off the table.</b>

53
00:04:21,933 --> 00:04:27,147
<b>And I also found that his lowest right rib
had healed from a previous fracture.</b>

54
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:29,482
<b>And the same goes for his lower left rib.</b>

<b>When we meet again, you'll pay for this.</b>

61

<b>Be careful. Okay?</b>

62
00:05:02,307 --> 00:05:03,391
<b>-Let's go.
-Take him.</b>

63

<b>-You're the social worker, right?
-Yes.</b>

64
00:05:09,272 --> 00:05:11,399
<b>The surgery will take two to three hours.</b>

65

<b>When he wakes up, he might be anxious.</b>

66

<b>So, please take good care of him.</b>

<b>and showed his face
only to Professor Kwon and his nurse.</b>

104
00:07:15,732 --> 00:07:17,942

<b>the fake son had to greet him

106

<b>On top of that, they've chosen

<b>with a candidate who was checked up

<b>And what about me?</b>

<b>His family is in pieces

160
00:10:04,901 --> 00:10:06,486

<b>What's wrong with your dad?</b>

162
00:10:11,199 --> 00:10:12,867
<b>He cheated on your mom</b>

163

164
00:10:16,037 --> 00:10:18,081
<b>And he was charged

165
00:10:18,164 --> 00:10:20,083
<b>He paid 10 billion won

<b>When I was a freshman,</b>

169
00:10:32,637 --> 00:10:34,639

170
00:10:34,722 --> 00:10:38,309
<b>I was the first to arrive,

171
00:10:38,601 --> 00:10:40,228
<b>It was then that Seok-hyeong's dad came</b>

172
00:10:41,479 --> 00:10:43,606
<b>and sent me on an errand
for a pack of cigarettes.</b>

<b>-What about it?
-Could it be?</b>

174
00:10:49,278 --> 00:10:50,822
<b>He didn't give me the money for it.</b>

175
00:10:52,865 --> 00:10:54,033
<b>He still hasn't paid me.</b>

176
00:10:54,117 --> 00:10:56,703
<b>It was 1,100 won. 88 Light.
It was unbelievable.</b>

177

00:11:02,917 --> 00:11:04,168
<b>-Seok-hyeong.
-Yes?</b>

180
00:11:04,252 --> 00:11:06,087
<b>He's not arrested, though.</b>

181
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:09,632
<b>Can you believe that? I don't get it.</b>

182
00:11:10,675 --> 00:11:12,677
<b>I bet he used his heart condition
to get off lightly.</b>

183
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,803
<b>What about your mom?</b>

184
00:11:13,886 --> 00:11:16,055
<b>She doesn't really care.</b>

185
00:11:16,139 --> 00:11:18,099
<b>But I think she actually wants him jailed.</b>

186
00:11:18,182 --> 00:11:20,393
<b>-Here's the pork belly.
-She should get divorced like me.</b>

187

<b>and because of her determination,</b>

299
00:18:02,339 --> 00:18:05,133
<b>I'm sure Bin will do just fine.</b>

300
00:18:05,216 --> 00:18:06,051
<b>But</b>

301
00:18:06,843 --> 00:18:09,179
<b>your husband's veins are dilated</b>

302
00:18:09,262 --> 00:18:11,348
<b>from the severe cirrhosis he's suffered,</b>

303
00:18:11,431 --> 00:18:14,851
<b>so it might be difficult to stop
the bleeding during the surgery.</b>

304
00:18:14,935 --> 00:18:18,229
<b>I'm sure they've explained it in detail
when you signed the consent form...</b>

305
00:18:19,022 --> 00:18:20,398
<b>Why aren't you asleep?</b>

306
00:18:20,982 --> 00:18:23,318
<b>Don't worry, Mom.</b>

307
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:26,655
<b>I heard he performs
this surgery all the time.</b>

308
00:18:26,738 --> 00:18:28,323
<b>I wouldn't say "all the time."</b>

309
00:18:28,907 --> 00:18:31,910
<b>I guess you're right.
I do it "all the time."</b>

310
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:34,287
<b>You're braver than your dad.</b>

311
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,957
<b>She's better than I am.</b>

312
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:41,252
<b>Bin, let's sleep together tonight.</b>

313
00:18:41,336 --> 00:18:43,463
<b>Gosh, forget it.</b>

314
00:18:44,214 --> 00:18:46,717
<b>Bye, doctor. See you.</b>

315
00:18:48,635 --> 00:18:51,054
<b>Sure. Tomorrow.</b>

316
00:18:53,556 --> 00:18:55,475
<b>SURGERY IN PROGRESS</b>

317
00:19:08,989 --> 00:19:10,365
<b>We're going to go slow.</b>

318
00:19:13,159 --> 00:19:16,371
<b>You said that your husband was strong.
I guess he isn't.</b>

319
00:19:18,707 --> 00:19:20,792
<b>What kind of father</b>

320
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:24,379
<b>takes his own daughter's liver to live?</b>

321
00:19:27,507 --> 00:19:30,385
<b>I'm such a horrible father.</b>

322
00:19:31,511 --> 00:19:34,597
<b>Sir, I'm sure the surgery will go well.</b>

323
00:19:34,806 --> 00:19:37,726
<b>Try to think of it as
going into a deep sleep.</b>

324
00:19:38,268 --> 00:19:41,479
<b>You need to calm down so that you
can be at optimum condition</b>

325
00:19:41,563 --> 00:19:43,690
<b>for the surgery to be successful.</b>

326
00:19:50,155 --> 00:19:51,322
<b>Be careful.</b>

327
00:19:51,406 --> 00:19:53,283
<b>-Hello.
-Hi.</b>

328
00:19:55,869 --> 00:19:58,038
<b>Lean against my back, honey.</b>

329
00:19:58,121 --> 00:20:00,623
<b>God, I'm fine. Stop that.</b>

330
00:20:03,376 --> 00:20:06,880
<b>Doctor, why is my baby not coming out yet?</b>

331
00:20:06,963 --> 00:20:09,841
<b>-I don't think the baby wants to meet us.
-Don't say that.</b>

332
00:20:09,924 --> 00:20:12,302
<b>Let's give it a few more days.
It's due soon.</b>

333
00:20:12,385 --> 00:20:15,847
<b>There's nothing wrong with her, right?
Is she fine?</b>

334
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:17,849
<b>Yes, everything looks good.</b>

335
00:20:18,433 --> 00:20:19,392
<b>Thank you.</b>

336
00:20:19,476 --> 00:20:22,854
<b>The mother's been doing a great job,
so everything's good.</b>

337
00:20:23,188 --> 00:20:26,107
<b>Leave the rest to me and try to relax.</b>

338
00:20:26,191 --> 00:20:28,485
<b>Eat well and sleep well,</b>

339
00:20:29,277 --> 00:20:30,111
<b>then you'll be fine.</b>

340
00:20:31,696 --> 00:20:34,282
<b>-Well, I have a question.
-Okay.</b>

341
00:20:34,866 --> 00:20:36,451
<b>Are you married, Doctor?</b>

342
00:20:36,534 --> 00:20:38,787
<b>Yes. Pardon?</b>

343
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:43,083
<b>I've been thinking that
you're such a good person.</b>

344
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:45,168
<b>I'd like to set you up with someone.</b>

345
00:20:46,586 --> 00:20:49,089
<b>It's okay. You don't have to do that.</b>

346
00:20:49,172 --> 00:20:51,174
<b>I guess you have a girlfriend.</b>

347
00:20:51,883 --> 00:20:55,095
<b>No, I don't. But still, it's fine.</b>

348
00:20:56,012 --> 00:20:58,348
<b>You're 37 weeks pregnant.</b>

349
00:20:58,431 --> 00:21:01,309
<b>So please come to the hospital right away
whenever your belly hurts, okay?</b>

350
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:03,728
<b>I have a question too.</b>

351
00:21:04,437 --> 00:21:06,231
<b>When she gives birth,</b>

352
00:21:06,815 --> 00:21:09,567
<b>is it okay for me to sing a song
in the delivery room?</b>

353
00:21:09,651 --> 00:21:12,862
<b>Come on. I told you, don't do that.
We'll get going.</b>

354
00:21:12,946 --> 00:21:16,699
<b>I've been singing the baby a song.
I'm sure my baby will love it.</b>

355
00:21:16,783 --> 00:21:18,827
<b>I really want to--</b>

356
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:20,870
<b>Honey, I'm--</b>

357
00:21:24,541 --> 00:21:26,292
<b>Gently.</b>

358
00:21:27,252 --> 00:21:29,671
<b>That's too strong. Hold back a little.</b>

359
00:21:30,255 --> 00:21:32,549
<b>You'll cut through it
if you put too much pressure.</b>

360
00:21:32,632 --> 00:21:33,967
<b>Okay. I'm sorry.</b>

361
00:21:34,843 --> 00:21:36,511
<b>-Didn't you get much sleep last night?
-No.</b>

362
00:21:36,594 --> 00:21:37,762
<b>I mean, I did.</b>

363
00:21:37,846 --> 00:21:39,472
<b>What? You were off yesterday.</b>

364
00:21:39,556 --> 00:21:42,058
<b>Professor Cheon Myeong-tae asked him
to examine 200 people</b>

365
00:21:42,142 --> 00:21:45,061
<b>to use as the data for his thesis
by today, so stayed up all night.</b>

366
00:21:45,937 --> 00:21:47,689
<b>Who's Professor Cheon Myeong-tae?</b>

367
00:21:47,772 --> 00:21:50,066
<b>A new professor who started last week.
Don't you know him?</b>

368
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:52,193
<b>No. Is he famous?</b>

369
00:21:52,277 --> 00:21:55,488
<b>Yes, he's famous for being
hard on his patients.</b>

370
00:22:01,911 --> 00:22:04,747
<b>I've done some research and read</b>

371
00:22:04,998 --> 00:22:07,750
<b>that aortic valve replacement is
usually done</b>

372
00:22:08,251 --> 00:22:10,420
<b>by minimally invasive method
in other countries.</b>

373
00:22:10,503 --> 00:22:12,172
<b>-Are you a doctor?
-Sorry?</b>

374
00:22:13,923 --> 00:22:17,468
<b>No, I'm just asking because I'm worried.</b>

375
00:22:17,552 --> 00:22:19,554
<b>Then surgeries are fine.</b>

376
00:22:20,638 --> 00:22:21,764
<b>Well, then.</b>

377
00:22:23,433 --> 00:22:26,019
<b>Let's go, Dad.</b>

378
00:22:27,979 --> 00:22:30,106
<b>I'll leave the rest to you, Dr. Do.</b>

379
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:31,191
<b>Professor.</b>

380
00:22:32,483 --> 00:22:35,278
<b>Don't abandon me, okay?</b>

381
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:41,117
<b>If you abandon me,
I'll be sold to another hospital.</b>

382
00:22:41,701 --> 00:22:42,660
<b>Focus!</b>

383
00:22:49,459 --> 00:22:50,543
<b>Let's focus.</b>

384
00:22:52,962 --> 00:22:54,047
<b>Then who'll take Geon-hui?</b>

385
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:55,548
<b>Dr. Ahn will.</b>

386
00:22:58,301 --> 00:22:59,969
<b>Hong Geon-hui, a five-year-old boy.</b>

387
00:23:00,053 --> 00:23:02,764
<b>He passed out while blowing a balloon
and was taken to the ER.</b>

388
00:23:02,847 --> 00:23:05,642
<b>According to the CT angiography,
we suspect it may be Moyamoya disease.</b>

389
00:23:05,725 --> 00:23:07,977
<b>And we've made the arrangements
for a TFCA this afternoon.</b>

390
00:23:08,061 --> 00:23:11,314
<b>He's currently on a ventilator
and is being hydrated.</b>

391
00:23:11,397 --> 00:23:12,941
<b>His condition is quite stable.</b>

392
00:23:13,024 --> 00:23:14,400
<b>What causes this disease?</b>

393
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:17,195
<b>I think it's genetic...</b>

394
00:23:18,738 --> 00:23:20,615
<b>There's a good chance</b>

395
00:23:20,698 --> 00:23:23,368
<b>that children will get Moyamoya disease
if their parents have it.</b>

396
00:23:23,451 --> 00:23:24,953
<b>However, not all of them do.</b>

397
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:27,747
<b>So it's not entirely genetic.</b>

398
00:23:28,748 --> 00:23:31,167
<b>Chi-hong, what do we have
to watch out for the most?</b>

399
00:23:31,751 --> 00:23:33,169
<b>We can't let him cry.</b>

400
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:36,798
<b>If he cries and yells, it'll constrict
the blood vessel in his brain</b>

401
00:23:36,881 --> 00:23:38,800
<b>and lower the blood flow to his brain,</b>

402
00:23:38,883 --> 00:23:41,386
<b>which will result
in a seizure or hemiplegia.</b>

403
00:23:41,594 --> 00:23:44,180
<b>That's correct. You can't let him cry.</b>

404
00:23:44,889 --> 00:23:47,558
<b>-That's so hard.
-Indeed, it's hard.</b>

405
00:23:47,976 --> 00:23:49,769
<b>Be careful when you take his CT.</b>

406
00:23:50,061 --> 00:23:51,562
<b>Calm him down before you take it.</b>

407
00:23:51,646 --> 00:23:54,232
<b>If it doesn't work,
you might have to give him Pocral.</b>

408
00:23:54,399 --> 00:23:56,567
<b>-It's safest to put him to sleep.
-Okay.</b>

409
00:23:57,527 --> 00:23:59,237
<b>Watch him closely and act accordingly.</b>

410
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,281
<b>I think that'll be enough.</b>

411
00:24:02,615 --> 00:24:03,950
<b>What about lunch, Seok-min?</b>

412
00:24:04,033 --> 00:24:07,203
<b>Dr. Do will buy lunch since
his installment savings matured today.</b>

413
00:24:07,287 --> 00:24:08,538
<b>I can join, right?</b>

414
00:24:09,038 --> 00:24:12,166
<b>Dr. Do, the infamous miser, is buying.
I have to be there.</b>

415
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,960
<b>Is he a miser?</b>

416
00:24:14,043 --> 00:24:16,587
<b>Yes, totally.
He's like a legend at the hospital.</b>

417
00:24:16,671 --> 00:24:19,799
<b>His monthly allowance is 100,000 won.
I heard he saves half of his monthly wage.</b>

418
00:24:19,882 --> 00:24:21,175
<b>That's amazing.</b>

419
00:24:22,677 --> 00:24:24,929
<b>All right, then. Have a nice lunch.</b>

420
00:24:25,513 --> 00:24:27,557
<b>What about me? I'm available.</b>

421
00:24:27,849 --> 00:24:30,059
<b>-What?
-I'm free for lunch.</b>

422
00:24:30,143 --> 00:24:31,352
<b>Why aren't you going?</b>

423
00:24:31,436 --> 00:24:33,187
<b>You're not? It's a historical moment.</b>

424
00:24:33,271 --> 00:24:35,857
<b>No, I won't.
I'll just have lunch with you.</b>

425
00:24:37,066 --> 00:24:38,609
<b>Okay. Let's go.</b>

426
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:39,944
<b>I'll buy you something fancy</b>

427
00:24:40,028 --> 00:24:42,405
<b>-at the Professors' Cafeteria.
-Really? What about me?</b>

428
00:24:42,989 --> 00:24:44,741
<b>-You should've said sooner.
-Too late.</b>

429
00:24:45,241 --> 00:24:48,161
<b>I'm taking Chi-hong only. Let's go.</b>

430
00:24:52,582 --> 00:24:55,376
<b>-I'll hold the portal vein.
-Okay, the hemostat's ready.</b>

431
00:25:01,716 --> 00:25:03,426
<b>-Is the perfusion ready?
-Yes.</b>

432
00:25:03,509 --> 00:25:05,011
<b>I'll hold the hepatic artery.</b>

433
00:25:08,556 --> 00:25:09,974
<b>It went well. It looks clean.</b>

434
00:25:10,475 --> 00:25:12,727
<b>Dr. Kim, there's no bleeding, right?</b>

435
00:25:13,144 --> 00:25:14,812
<b>Check for bleeding and wrap it up, please.</b>

436
00:25:15,313 --> 00:25:16,522
<b>Good job, Doctor.</b>

437
00:25:17,315 --> 00:25:20,651
<b>Go get some rest. You have to perform
the transplant surgery.</b>

438
00:25:21,444 --> 00:25:23,279
<b>They're still doing hepatectomy.</b>

439
00:25:23,363 --> 00:25:24,572
<b>Okay, I will.</b>

440
00:25:26,449 --> 00:25:29,619
<b>Keep it up, people. You too, Gyeo-ul.</b>

441
00:25:30,036 --> 00:25:31,120
<b>Sure.</b>

442
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:36,250
<b>-Give me the vascular clamp.
-What's the vital?</b>

443
00:25:36,334 --> 00:25:38,419
<b>BP is 90-60 and the pulse rate is at 100.</b>

444
00:25:38,753 --> 00:25:39,879
<b>Suction. I can't see.</b>

445
00:25:40,713 --> 00:25:42,006
<b>More suction. And gauze.</b>

446
00:25:42,215 --> 00:25:44,425
<b>-I brought three bags of RBC.
-Wider.</b>

447
00:25:44,967 --> 00:25:46,094
<b>A bit more. I can't see.</b>

448
00:25:46,177 --> 00:25:48,012
<b>-Widen it more, please.
-Give me another lever.</b>

449
00:25:48,096 --> 00:25:50,306
<b>-Get me a full dose of--
-Keep suctioning.</b>

450
00:25:50,807 --> 00:25:52,767
<b>Gauze. There.</b>

451
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:54,977
<b>-Bring more blood.
-Wider, please.</b>

452
00:25:57,105 --> 00:25:58,564
<b>Is he bleeding too much? Is he okay?</b>

453
00:25:59,148 --> 00:26:01,484
<b>There's an opening in the IVC,
but I can't get to it.</b>

454
00:26:01,567 --> 00:26:03,152
<b>Anesthesiology, are his vitals okay?</b>

455
00:26:04,278 --> 00:26:07,407
<b>He's been bleeding quite a bit,
but his vitals are okay now.</b>

456
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:09,075
<b>Thank you. You want me to join?</b>

457
00:26:10,034 --> 00:26:11,035
<b>I think you should.</b>

458
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:12,453
<b>Keep pressing on it. I'm going in.</b>

459
00:26:18,501 --> 00:26:21,045
<b>Anesthesiology, we got the major bleeding.</b>

460
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:24,132
<b>The liver was surrounding the IVC,</b>

461
00:26:24,215 --> 00:26:26,884
<b>so it started bleeding while we were
removing it. This is hard.</b>

462
00:26:27,427 --> 00:26:30,012
<b>You know Professor Kwon,
the master of liver transplants, right?</b>

463
00:26:30,096 --> 00:26:32,849
<b>-Yes.
-On his first surgery as a fellow,</b>

464
00:26:33,099 --> 00:26:36,561
<b>his patient started bleeding
the moment he opened the chest.</b>

465
00:26:37,145 --> 00:26:40,440
<b>He was removed after stopping the blood.
He didn't even get to see the liver.</b>

466
00:26:40,648 --> 00:26:41,691
<b>I see.</b>

467
00:26:42,191 --> 00:26:44,318
<b>It's okay. This happens a lot.</b>

468
00:26:44,944 --> 00:26:47,280
<b>And when this happens again,
you'll do better.</b>

469
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:50,074
<b>If you can't, call me again.</b>

470
00:26:50,491 --> 00:26:51,576
<b>Okay. Thank you.</b>

471
00:26:51,659 --> 00:26:53,578
<b>And we have to save him no matter what.</b>

472
00:26:53,661 --> 00:26:55,496
<b>If anything goes wrong, Bin will kill me.</b>

473
00:26:56,873 --> 00:26:57,915
<b>Okay.</b>

474
00:27:01,377 --> 00:27:02,670
<b>The specimen is coming out.</b>

475
00:27:06,299 --> 00:27:08,134
<b>You've never failed
to make a single deposit.</b>

476
00:27:09,385 --> 00:27:11,304
<b>It's hard enough to make 60 payments
over 5 years,</b>

477
00:27:11,387 --> 00:27:15,016
<b>but you've never even been late once.
You're amazing.</b>

478
00:27:15,099 --> 00:27:17,310
<b>So, how much is it in total?</b>

479
00:27:17,393 --> 00:27:18,853
<b>You're withdrawing a mature saving.</b>

480
00:27:18,936 --> 00:27:22,773
<b>Including the principal and interest
of the last five years excluding tax,</b>

481
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:25,568
<b>it's 100,128,480 won.</b>

482
00:27:26,027 --> 00:27:28,863
<b>It's been wired to your account.
Congratulations.</b>

483
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:31,908
<b>One, ten, a hundred...</b>

484
00:27:32,492 --> 00:27:36,037
<b>And this is a gift
from the branch manager.</b>

485
00:27:37,121 --> 00:27:38,664
<b>I get a gift too?</b>

486
00:27:38,748 --> 00:27:41,250
<b>You've been our regular for five years.
This is nothing.</b>

487
00:27:41,334 --> 00:27:43,294
<b>The manager also sent you
his congratulations.</b>

488
00:27:43,377 --> 00:27:45,171
<b>This is enough to last me a year.</b>

489
00:27:45,254 --> 00:27:48,466
<b>Sorry? You shouldn't be like that now.</b>

490
00:27:48,549 --> 00:27:49,759
<b>Your wife must not like it.</b>

491
00:27:49,842 --> 00:27:53,012
<b>She doesn't even turn the lights on
in the house before 8 p.m.</b>

492
00:27:57,141 --> 00:27:58,017
<b>Honey.</b>

493
00:27:59,018 --> 00:28:00,186
<b>We have 100 million now.</b>

494
00:28:01,145 --> 00:28:02,438
<b>No, 100 million!</b>

495
00:28:03,981 --> 00:28:04,982
<b>Bye.</b>

496
00:28:05,733 --> 00:28:08,694
<b>I know. I felt bad since
I always mooched off them.</b>

497
00:28:09,028 --> 00:28:11,072
<b>I'll treat them to something nice.</b>

498
00:28:20,331 --> 00:28:21,749
<b>Seriously?</b>

499
00:28:22,124 --> 00:28:24,335
<b>I'm sorry.
I'll buy you pork belly next time.</b>

500
00:28:24,919 --> 00:28:26,045
<b>Thanks for the food.</b>

501
00:28:27,338 --> 00:28:28,714
<b>Come on. Eat already.</b>

502
00:28:28,798 --> 00:28:31,592
<b>For him, it's like he's buying beef.</b>

503
00:28:33,803 --> 00:28:36,222
<b>I'm sorry, Seok-min. I really am.</b>

504
00:28:36,764 --> 00:28:38,558
<b>I've sent all the money
to my wife right away.</b>

505
00:28:38,641 --> 00:28:41,018
<b>I wanted to show her that
we do have 100 million won.</b>

506
00:28:41,102 --> 00:28:44,146
<b>Did you say 100 million?
How much did you deposit per month?</b>

507
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:45,648
<b>It was 1.6 million a month.</b>

508
00:28:46,232 --> 00:28:47,149
<b>Is that even possible?</b>

509
00:28:47,233 --> 00:28:49,944
<b>Of course. He doesn't spend
any money at all.</b>

510
00:28:50,319 --> 00:28:53,239
<b>Still, what about the maintenance fee
for the house,</b>

511
00:28:53,322 --> 00:28:55,700
<b>the phone bill and other living costs?</b>

512
00:28:56,325 --> 00:28:57,785
<b>My wife works full-time as well.</b>

513
00:28:58,119 --> 00:29:00,830
<b>She's never taken a single day off
since we've married.</b>

514
00:29:01,372 --> 00:29:04,000
<b>We've saved up for 10 years
and now it's exactly 100 million.</b>

515
00:29:04,792 --> 00:29:06,419
<b>What will you do with that money?</b>

516
00:29:06,627 --> 00:29:07,670
<b>Well...</b>

517
00:29:08,838 --> 00:29:09,964
<b>I'm leasing a house tomorrow.</b>

518
00:29:11,257 --> 00:29:12,466
<b>Congrats!</b>

519
00:29:14,844 --> 00:29:16,345
<b>I'm really happy right now.</b>

520
00:29:17,096 --> 00:29:20,266
<b>I know it's a small apartment,
but it's on a deposit basis.</b>

521
00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:21,809
<b>How much is it?</b>

522
00:29:22,602 --> 00:29:26,522
<b>With a loan and the money I've saved up,
it's 200 million won.</b>

523
00:29:27,023 --> 00:29:28,316
<b>Read the contract carefully.</b>

524
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:30,484
<b>There's been a lot of scams
on the news lately.</b>

525
00:29:31,068 --> 00:29:33,696
<b>Hey, I've studied for ten years
to be where I am.</b>

526
00:29:33,904 --> 00:29:34,947
<b>I don't need your advice.</b>

527
00:29:35,031 --> 00:29:36,782
<b>What about the landlord?</b>

528
00:29:36,866 --> 00:29:39,035
<b>Mind your own business.</b>

529
00:29:40,161 --> 00:29:42,246
<b>The real estate agencies
take care of everything now.</b>

530
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:44,332
<b>You should set aside
at least half a million.</b>

531
00:29:44,415 --> 00:29:47,293
<b>You and your wife should go on a trip
on the weekend.</b>

532
00:29:47,877 --> 00:29:48,961
<b>A trip?</b>

533
00:29:49,712 --> 00:29:51,297
<b>-What's a trip?
-The weekend?</b>

534
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:53,299
<b>What's a weekend?</b>

535
00:30:04,226 --> 00:30:07,480
<b>It's so hot.</b>

536
00:30:07,647 --> 00:30:10,858
<b>Why is it so hot?</b>

537
00:30:10,941 --> 00:30:12,151
<b>Aren't I amazing?</b>

538
00:30:12,234 --> 00:30:15,112
<b>I've grown all of them myself
just like how I've brought you up.</b>

539
00:30:15,613 --> 00:30:17,865
<b>You have a bad back.
You shouldn't be farming.</b>

540
00:30:18,366 --> 00:30:21,243
<b>And Mom, eating only vegetables
is not that healthy.</b>

541
00:30:21,827 --> 00:30:25,331
<b>These are organic. No pesticides.
It's healthy.</b>

542
00:30:25,414 --> 00:30:28,626
<b>It's more like you couldn't spray them
because of your bad back.</b>

543
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:32,338
<b>And you should have
a more balanced diet at your age.</b>

544
00:30:32,421 --> 00:30:34,548
<b>Okay. Eat now, it's getting cold.</b>

545
00:30:35,257 --> 00:30:38,260
<b>Protein, iron, omega-3, and calcium.</b>

546
00:30:38,344 --> 00:30:41,430
<b>Your anemia and dizziness
come from lack of nutrition.</b>

547
00:30:41,514 --> 00:30:42,932
<b>I'm eating well,</b>

548
00:30:43,015 --> 00:30:44,600
<b>-so worry about yourself.
-You're not.</b>

549
00:30:44,684 --> 00:30:47,395
<b>Eat like this, and you'll suffer
from malnutrition.</b>

550
00:30:48,187 --> 00:30:49,313
<b>Look over there.</b>

551
00:30:54,652 --> 00:30:56,696
<b>See? I really am eating well.</b>

552
00:30:56,779 --> 00:30:59,156
<b>If you have all of that,
then you're a drug addict.</b>

553
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:02,326
<b>I'll just live like this until I croak.
Be quiet and eat.</b>

554
00:31:02,410 --> 00:31:04,537
<b>-Why...
-Hey, try this.</b>

555
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:08,332
<b>It's seasoned aster.
I made it myself, and it's divine.</b>

556
00:31:09,417 --> 00:31:11,711
<b>Jeez, I can't argue with you.</b>

557
00:31:15,548 --> 00:31:16,632
<b>It's good.</b>

558
00:31:19,844 --> 00:31:23,431
<b>By the way, about the thing
I told you about last time...</b>

559
00:31:23,806 --> 00:31:24,890
<b>We need red pepper paste.</b>

560
00:31:40,698 --> 00:31:42,575
<b>This is insane.
How can it be so delicious?</b>

561
00:31:42,658 --> 00:31:44,285
<b>Right? It's divine, right?</b>

562
00:31:44,869 --> 00:31:46,954
<b>-It's heavenly.
-Try this too.</b>

563
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:56,756
<b>I've talked to my brother,
asked my sisters,</b>

564
00:31:56,839 --> 00:31:58,966
<b>and even asked
the Seoul Archdiocese about this.</b>

565
00:31:59,717 --> 00:32:02,762
<b>It's difficult in Korea
because of the age limit,</b>

566
00:32:03,304 --> 00:32:05,806
<b>but I can study to become
a priest in Italy.</b>

567
00:32:06,974 --> 00:32:10,603
<b>I've sent the letter of recommendation
and I'm waiting to hear from them.</b>

568
00:32:11,353 --> 00:32:14,106
<b>I think I'll regret it
if I don't do it any sooner</b>

569
00:32:15,566 --> 00:32:16,525
<b>Mom.</b>

570
00:32:17,359 --> 00:32:18,527
<b>Mom.</b>

571
00:32:19,612 --> 00:32:21,572
<b>You can't. Studying to become a priest?</b>

572
00:32:22,448 --> 00:32:23,783
<b>Study to become a groom in Korea.</b>

573
00:32:26,285 --> 00:32:28,829
<b>-You don't even have a girlfriend?
-Gosh...</b>

574
00:32:28,913 --> 00:32:31,081
<b>Your brothers and sisters could,
but not you.</b>

575
00:32:31,749 --> 00:32:32,917
<b>I'll get too lonely.</b>

576
00:32:36,045 --> 00:32:38,798
<b>Jong-su and Seok-hyeong's moms
will be here soon. Hurry and eat.</b>

577
00:32:43,969 --> 00:32:45,137
<b>It's so hot.</b>

578
00:32:53,229 --> 00:32:54,271
<b>Stronger.</b>

579
00:32:58,567 --> 00:32:59,735
<b>Mom.</b>

580
00:33:05,825 --> 00:33:07,243
<b>You're good.</b>

581
00:33:08,244 --> 00:33:11,330
<b>You must be dexterous
since you're a surgeon.</b>

582
00:33:11,413 --> 00:33:13,666
<b>Delicacy is the most important
for a surgeon.</b>

583
00:33:15,417 --> 00:33:18,212
<b>Don't just remove the heads.
Remove the wastes in the middle.</b>

584
00:33:18,838 --> 00:33:20,130
<b>Goodness.</b>

585
00:33:20,881 --> 00:33:24,385
<b>How are we supposed
to do all of this by hand?</b>

586
00:33:28,848 --> 00:33:30,266
<b>You know the laparoscope, right?</b>

587
00:33:31,016 --> 00:33:32,142
<b>Tell her we used that.</b>

588
00:33:35,729 --> 00:33:37,231
<b>Stop right there. Hands in the air.</b>

589
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:42,236
<b>Didn't I tell you to keep the head
because I'm going to use them?</b>

590
00:33:42,653 --> 00:33:43,737
<b>You did, ma'am.</b>

591
00:33:43,988 --> 00:33:46,615
<b>But you threw away the heads
and didn't even remove the wastes.</b>

592
00:33:47,324 --> 00:33:48,909
<b>I did.</b>

593
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:51,537
<b>It's just a few of them.</b>

594
00:33:52,037 --> 00:33:54,415
<b>There isn't even 20.</b>

595
00:33:55,249 --> 00:33:56,458
<b>Okay, let's see.</b>

596
00:33:57,334 --> 00:34:00,546
<b>I can't remember which is which.</b>

597
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:02,715
<b>I'll do it again.</b>

598
00:34:03,048 --> 00:34:04,633
<b>I'll find them all.</b>

599
00:34:04,717 --> 00:34:06,677
<b>Find every single one of them, okay?</b>

600
00:34:07,303 --> 00:34:08,429
<b>If there's even a single drop</b>

601
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:11,098
<b>that I find while cooking my broth,
I'm going to kill you.</b>

602
00:34:11,682 --> 00:34:12,933
<b>Yes, ma'am.</b>

603
00:34:15,019 --> 00:34:17,313
<b>Director, pass me the trimmed ones.</b>

604
00:34:17,396 --> 00:34:18,772
<b>Sure, ma'am.</b>

605
00:34:20,274 --> 00:34:22,443
<b>Hurry up. You have to trim
the spring onions after this.</b>

606
00:34:23,235 --> 00:34:25,779
<b>Darn it. I came because
you said you'll cook us to noodles,</b>

607
00:34:25,863 --> 00:34:27,281
<b>but I guess it was just a trap.</b>

608
00:34:27,865 --> 00:34:31,493
<b>To be honest, how could the two of us
trim all of these?</b>

609
00:34:32,077 --> 00:34:34,622
<b>Have you no conscience?</b>

610
00:34:36,832 --> 00:34:40,377
<b>God... How come every one of them
has the waste?</b>

611
00:34:40,461 --> 00:34:41,629
<b>Here's one more.</b>

612
00:34:45,382 --> 00:34:49,345
<b>So, that woman who's dressed
like Audrey Hepburn</b>

613
00:34:49,762 --> 00:34:52,514
<b>from head to toe is</b>

614
00:34:53,015 --> 00:34:55,893
<b>Professor Yang Seok-hyeong's mother?</b>

615
00:34:55,976 --> 00:34:58,520
<b>Yes. She's Dr. Yang's mother</b>

616
00:34:58,771 --> 00:35:00,689
<b>and the wife of Chairman Yang Tae-yang</b>

617
00:35:01,607 --> 00:35:03,317
<b>-of Taegeon Apparel.
-I see.</b>

618
00:35:04,151 --> 00:35:05,945
<b>I should help you,</b>

619
00:35:06,028 --> 00:35:08,113
<b>but I'm not feeling well. I'm sorry.</b>

620
00:35:08,614 --> 00:35:11,784
<b>It's okay. We're almost done.</b>

621
00:35:13,077 --> 00:35:15,454
<b>Ma'am, would you like some coffee?
Iced? Hot?</b>

622
00:35:15,537 --> 00:35:16,580
<b>Coffee?</b>

623
00:35:17,456 --> 00:35:19,875
<b>By the way, why are you not married?</b>

624
00:35:19,959 --> 00:35:21,543
<b>Okay, iced it is.</b>

625
00:35:23,087 --> 00:35:24,338
<b>I think I have enough now.</b>

626
00:35:24,922 --> 00:35:26,173
<b>-Really?
-Yes.</b>

627
00:35:27,216 --> 00:35:29,259
<b>Oh, my back.</b>

628
00:35:31,428 --> 00:35:34,264
<b>Hey, my puppy.</b>

629
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:37,768
<b>You called me
because you missed your grandpa?</b>

630
00:35:38,394 --> 00:35:40,646
<b>-What game?
-What's the point of having</b>

631
00:35:40,729 --> 00:35:42,898
<b>-children who are doctors and lawyers?
-You do what?</b>

632
00:35:42,982 --> 00:35:45,526
<b>Their dad can't even
have proper meals on time.</b>

633
00:35:46,527 --> 00:35:48,320
<b>I told you to dress casually.</b>

634
00:35:48,821 --> 00:35:50,364
<b>You can be comfortable around them.</b>

635
00:35:50,447 --> 00:35:52,700
<b>I am dressed casually.</b>

636
00:35:58,872 --> 00:36:00,040
<b>Do what?</b>

637
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,334
<b>The mafia game.</b>

638
00:36:03,002 --> 00:36:04,169
<b>-Is that it?
-Yes.</b>

639
00:36:05,087 --> 00:36:08,257
<b>My grandson is coming next weekend,</b>

640
00:36:09,008 --> 00:36:12,261
<b>and he wants me to play the mafia game
with him. What do I do?</b>

641
00:36:13,178 --> 00:36:16,265
<b>You can do it.
A lot of young people play it. It's fun.</b>

642
00:36:16,348 --> 00:36:19,143
<b>It must be fun since <i>The Godfather</i> is fun.</b>

643
00:36:20,477 --> 00:36:23,313
<b>Yes. To put it simply,</b>

644
00:36:23,647 --> 00:36:26,400
<b>one of you is chosen as the mafia.</b>

645
00:36:26,483 --> 00:36:29,319
<b>And the rest of you
will be innocent civilians.</b>

646
00:36:29,403 --> 00:36:32,239
<b>When you're chosen as the mafia,
you have to pretend to be a civilian</b>

647
00:36:32,322 --> 00:36:33,741
<b>to not get caught by them.</b>

648
00:36:33,824 --> 00:36:36,827
<b>The goal is to figure out
who the mafia is.</b>

649
00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:39,830
<b>I see. That's easy.</b>

650
00:36:40,831 --> 00:36:42,791
<b>We have to find out
which one of us is lying, then.</b>

651
00:36:43,876 --> 00:36:46,712
<b>That's right. I'll lead the game.</b>

652
00:36:46,795 --> 00:36:50,174
<b>Since there are four of you, if a civilian
dies in the first round, it's game over.</b>

653
00:36:50,257 --> 00:36:52,051
<b>The mafia will win.</b>

654
00:36:52,134 --> 00:36:53,969
<b>Do you all understand the rules?</b>

655
00:36:54,053 --> 00:36:57,264
<b>I'm good at fishing out people
who are hiding things.</b>

656
00:36:57,347 --> 00:36:59,183
<b>-I think I can ace this game.
-Same here.</b>

657
00:36:59,266 --> 00:37:01,602
<b>If we're playing a game,
there should be a prize.</b>

658
00:37:01,685 --> 00:37:03,645
<b>We don't win anything? No prizes?</b>

659
00:37:03,729 --> 00:37:05,731
<b>Right. Hold on.</b>

660
00:37:06,607 --> 00:37:07,649
<b>Here.</b>

661
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:09,693
<b>I got them from the hospital.</b>

662
00:37:09,777 --> 00:37:11,570
<b>Those are the tickets I gave out.</b>

663
00:37:12,071 --> 00:37:15,282
<b>Yes. These are recital tickets
I got from the hospital.</b>

664
00:37:15,365 --> 00:37:17,618
<b>-How come I didn't get one?
-I didn't get one, either.</b>

665
00:37:17,701 --> 00:37:20,412
<b>They only gave me ten tickets.</b>

666
00:37:20,496 --> 00:37:22,790
<b>So I gave the tickets to the doctors
at the VIP Ward</b>

667
00:37:22,873 --> 00:37:24,333
<b>to thank them for their hard work.</b>

668
00:37:24,792 --> 00:37:28,378
<b>Besides, you don't know much
about classical music anyway.</b>

669
00:37:29,963 --> 00:37:32,257
<b>You should've given me the tickets.
Why bring them out here?</b>

670
00:37:32,341 --> 00:37:34,343
<b>You can win the game and take the tickets.</b>

671
00:37:34,426 --> 00:37:36,720
<b>Besides, you're not even interested
in classical music.</b>

672
00:37:36,804 --> 00:37:38,013
<b>Go with your girlfriend.</b>

673
00:37:38,097 --> 00:37:39,598
<b>I don't have a girlfriend!</b>

674
00:37:39,681 --> 00:37:40,933
<b>Why don't you have one?</b>

675
00:37:41,016 --> 00:37:42,935
<b>You're a handsome doctor
at a university hospital.</b>

676
00:37:43,018 --> 00:37:44,686
<b>You should have a girlfriend.</b>

677
00:37:44,770 --> 00:37:46,105
<b>He doesn't have one</b>

678
00:37:46,188 --> 00:37:48,482
<b>because he hangs out with his friends
and plays in the band.</b>

679
00:37:48,899 --> 00:37:52,069
<b>Seok-hyeong might not have a girlfriend
since he's divorced,</b>

680
00:37:52,569 --> 00:37:54,279
<b>but why don't you have a girlfriend?</b>

681
00:37:54,488 --> 00:37:56,323
<b>Is there anyone you're interested in?</b>

682
00:37:56,615 --> 00:37:58,450
<b>-There is.
-Who?</b>

683
00:37:59,493 --> 00:38:00,494
<b>The Lord.</b>

684
00:38:02,204 --> 00:38:03,497
<b>Mom!</b>

685
00:38:06,041 --> 00:38:07,000
<b>I'm leaving.</b>

686
00:38:07,292 --> 00:38:09,503
<b>No. You can't leave yet.</b>

687
00:38:09,586 --> 00:38:11,213
<b>Professor Ahn, sit down.</b>

688
00:38:11,296 --> 00:38:13,590
<b>You need to teach us
how to play the game before you go.</b>

689
00:38:14,383 --> 00:38:16,135
<b>You should let him eat in peace.</b>

690
00:38:17,136 --> 00:38:19,346
<b>What's so bad about being religious?</b>

691
00:38:19,429 --> 00:38:22,224
<b>-Right.
-You love Him a lot, too.</b>

692
00:38:22,307 --> 00:38:26,270
<b>-Exactly.
-Seriously. You're so selfish.</b>

693
00:38:26,854 --> 00:38:27,855
<b>What's that?</b>

694
00:38:30,941 --> 00:38:31,859
<b>It's...</b>

695
00:38:33,861 --> 00:38:35,946
<b>It's seaweed.</b>

696
00:38:40,159 --> 00:38:42,327
<b>All right. We'll begin now.</b>

697
00:38:42,411 --> 00:38:44,830
<b>After I announce, "It is night,"</b>

698
00:38:44,913 --> 00:38:46,665
<b>I will pick someone as the mafia.</b>

699
00:38:46,748 --> 00:38:49,960
<b>And when I say, "It is morning,"</b>

700
00:38:50,043 --> 00:38:54,089
<b>that's when you start looking for
who is in the mafia.</b>

701
00:38:54,173 --> 00:38:56,049
<b>We have to do this all night?</b>

702
00:38:56,133 --> 00:38:58,677
<b>That must be why
only young people play this game.</b>

703
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:00,345
<b>I have an appointment in the afternoon.</b>

704
00:39:00,429 --> 00:39:02,556
<b>Then you should leave early.</b>

705
00:39:03,473 --> 00:39:05,809
<b>Since we're all here,
let's give it a go at least once.</b>

706
00:39:06,143 --> 00:39:09,104
<b>You're all available
this afternoon, right?</b>

707
00:39:09,563 --> 00:39:10,981
<b>Jeong-won, do you have any plans?</b>

708
00:39:14,193 --> 00:39:16,778
<b>All right. It is night.</b>

709
00:39:16,862 --> 00:39:19,740
<b>Everyone. Close your eyes
and lower your head.</b>

710
00:39:20,073 --> 00:39:23,869
<b>Now, I'm going to choose someone
to be the mafia.</b>

711
00:39:23,952 --> 00:39:25,746
<b>All right.</b>

712
00:39:28,415 --> 00:39:29,833
<b>Now, the mafia will--</b>

713
00:39:29,917 --> 00:39:32,836
<b>It's me. I'm the mafia.</b>

714
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,296
<b>It's her.</b>

715
00:39:34,379 --> 00:39:36,048
<b>I felt something go past me.</b>

716
00:39:37,674 --> 00:39:40,135
<b>-It's me.
-Congrats.</b>

717
00:39:42,012 --> 00:39:44,431
<b>All right. It's morning.</b>

718
00:39:44,514 --> 00:39:48,769
<b>Now, you have to find out
who the mafia is.</b>

719
00:39:48,852 --> 00:39:50,979
<b>Stop tapping the floor now.</b>

720
00:39:52,522 --> 00:39:56,151
<b>-It's not me.
-We didn't say anything.</b>

721
00:39:56,235 --> 00:39:58,320
<b>I'm not a yakuza, either.</b>

722
00:39:59,696 --> 00:40:02,366
<b>This game isn't called "Yakuza."
It's called "Mafia."</b>

723
00:40:03,992 --> 00:40:04,952
<b>What about you?</b>

724
00:40:06,119 --> 00:40:08,872
<b>You're stupid.
I'm not supposed to tell you.</b>

725
00:40:09,373 --> 00:40:11,833
<b>Whatever you are,
you should say that you're a civilian.</b>

726
00:40:11,917 --> 00:40:13,293
<b>Why won't you say that?</b>

727
00:40:13,377 --> 00:40:15,921
<b>Really? I can say that?</b>

728
00:40:17,047 --> 00:40:18,340
<b>I'm a civilian.</b>

729
00:40:20,259 --> 00:40:22,094
<b>You're doing that on purpose, aren't you?</b>

730
00:40:22,594 --> 00:40:25,097
<b>-Aren't you the mafia?
-Me? No, I'm not.</b>

731
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:26,682
<b>Hold on.</b>

732
00:40:27,182 --> 00:40:31,353
<b>Since it's advantageous for you
to suspect me as the mafia,</b>

733
00:40:31,436 --> 00:40:35,065
<b>I should say that I am in the mafia.</b>

734
00:40:35,565 --> 00:40:37,442
<b>I am the mafia. I'm not a civilian.</b>

735
00:40:37,526 --> 00:40:39,486
<b>How do you run the foundation
with that brain?</b>

736
00:40:39,569 --> 00:40:40,404
<b>Just retire soon.</b>

737
00:40:40,487 --> 00:40:42,781
<b>-Don't run our hospital into the ground.
-What do you mean?</b>

738
00:40:42,906 --> 00:40:46,618
<b>As soon as I took over the hospital,
our profit skyrocketed.</b>

739
00:40:47,744 --> 00:40:51,373
<b>And thanks to her husband, our hospital
is covered by the press a lot these days.</b>

740
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:52,833
<b>Our hospital is doing very well.</b>

741
00:40:52,916 --> 00:40:56,461
<b>Why is your face getting so red?</b>

742
00:40:58,005 --> 00:40:59,256
<b>-Me?
-Yes.</b>

743
00:40:59,798 --> 00:41:02,634
<b>-Are you the mafia?
-Your face is redder than his.</b>

744
00:41:02,718 --> 00:41:05,178
<b>Aren't you in the mafia?
You've been quite chatty.</b>

745
00:41:05,262 --> 00:41:07,055
<b>No, I'm not. How can I be the mafia?</b>

746
00:41:07,139 --> 00:41:11,143
<b>No one in the mafia would openly say
that they are in the mafia.</b>

747
00:41:11,226 --> 00:41:12,519
<b>It's really not me!</b>

748
00:41:12,602 --> 00:41:14,187
<b>Jong-su, say something.</b>

749
00:41:15,772 --> 00:41:18,233
<b>Rosa isn't the mafia.</b>

750
00:41:18,317 --> 00:41:19,609
<b>How do you know that?</b>

751
00:41:19,693 --> 00:41:21,361
<b>Because I'm the mafia.</b>

752
00:41:22,362 --> 00:41:23,905
<b>What is he doing?</b>

753
00:41:24,156 --> 00:41:26,533
<b>Did Jeong-won tap you
on your shoulder or not?</b>

754
00:41:28,243 --> 00:41:30,704
<b>-He didn't.
-Jong-su, be quiet.</b>

755
00:41:31,288 --> 00:41:33,248
<b>Seeing how you keep trying
to eliminate me,</b>

756
00:41:33,332 --> 00:41:34,791
<b>I think you are the mafia.</b>

757
00:41:34,875 --> 00:41:36,376
<b>-Shall we vote?
-Let's do it.</b>

758
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:37,878
<b>I think you're in the mafia.</b>

759
00:41:37,961 --> 00:41:39,254
<b>I'm sure of it, too.</b>

760
00:41:39,338 --> 00:41:40,839
<b>Let's vote Rosa out.</b>

761
00:41:40,922 --> 00:41:42,966
<b>My gosh. It's really not me!</b>

762
00:41:43,050 --> 00:41:45,218
<b>I'm not in the mafia.</b>

763
00:41:45,302 --> 00:41:47,054
<b>Jong-su, don't you believe me?</b>

764
00:41:47,137 --> 00:41:48,430
<b>I do.</b>

765
00:41:48,513 --> 00:41:50,807
<b>Everyone. I am the mafia.</b>

766
00:41:50,891 --> 00:41:52,517
<b>Forget it. Just vote.</b>

767
00:41:52,934 --> 00:41:54,269
<b>Professor Ahn, proceed.</b>

768
00:41:54,436 --> 00:41:58,273
<b>-Fine, let's vote. It's two against two.
-You can't vote if someone calls you out.</b>

769
00:41:58,357 --> 00:42:00,233
<b>Why are there so many rules?</b>

770
00:42:00,317 --> 00:42:02,277
<b>Change the rule so I can vote
since it's my house.</b>

771
00:42:02,361 --> 00:42:03,779
<b>Yes. Let her vote.</b>

772
00:42:03,862 --> 00:42:07,240
<b>All right. The voting will take place.</b>

773
00:42:07,324 --> 00:42:10,952
<b>If you believe Jeong Rosa is the mafia,</b>

774
00:42:11,036 --> 00:42:12,204
<b>raise your thumb</b>

775
00:42:12,287 --> 00:42:14,122
<b>-facing up.
-Yes.</b>

776
00:42:17,542 --> 00:42:18,502
<b>Hey.</b>

777
00:42:20,921 --> 00:42:22,214
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

778
00:42:22,798 --> 00:42:24,758
<b>How could you betray me like this?</b>

779
00:42:25,384 --> 00:42:27,302
<b>And the votes are in.</b>

780
00:42:30,847 --> 00:42:33,809
<b>Jeong Rosa,
an innocent civilian, has died.</b>

781
00:42:33,892 --> 00:42:35,685
<b>I told you that it wasn't me!</b>

782
00:42:35,769 --> 00:42:39,648
<b>The person in the mafia was</b>

783
00:42:39,731 --> 00:42:42,401
<b>Ju Jong-su.</b>

784
00:42:43,568 --> 00:42:45,028
<b>What? You bastard!</b>

785
00:42:46,738 --> 00:42:48,782
<b>Jeez. What the...</b>

786
00:42:48,865 --> 00:42:51,993
<b>I should have known.
You were always so sly.</b>

787
00:42:52,077 --> 00:42:55,455
<b>You even look like a weasel. You fraud.</b>

788
00:42:55,539 --> 00:42:58,375
<b>You lied in elementary school
saying that you went to feed the cows</b>

789
00:42:58,458 --> 00:43:01,420
<b>when you went to the hill and
drank <i>makgeolli.</i> I should've known then.</b>

790
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:03,755
<b>This is just a game.</b>

791
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:06,466
<b>This is how you play this game.</b>

792
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:08,343
<b>Aren't I right, Professor Ahn?</b>

793
00:43:08,427 --> 00:43:10,053
<b>Totally.</b>

794
00:43:12,139 --> 00:43:14,307
<b>Whether it is a game or gambling,</b>

795
00:43:14,391 --> 00:43:16,810
<b>your true colors are bound to show
when you play.</b>

796
00:43:16,893 --> 00:43:18,770
<b>Even if you had to betray someone,</b>

797
00:43:18,854 --> 00:43:19,896
<b>how could you betray</b>

798
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:21,857
<b>your best friend of 65 years?
How could you?</b>

799
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:24,943
<b>I was just playing the game
the best I could.</b>

800
00:43:25,110 --> 00:43:26,903
<b>-Give me that. I'll do it.
-Forget it.</b>

801
00:43:26,987 --> 00:43:28,447
<b>-Give me that.
-My gosh.</b>

802
00:43:28,530 --> 00:43:29,531
<b>-Come here.
-Oh, no.</b>

803
00:43:29,614 --> 00:43:31,908
<b>-Wait.
-Stop it. My gosh.</b>

804
00:43:31,992 --> 00:43:34,619
<b>-Hold on.
-Goodness!</b>

805
00:43:34,703 --> 00:43:35,871
<b>-How could you?
-Hey.</b>

806
00:43:41,918 --> 00:43:44,337
<b>Hey, Seok-hyeong.
Did you deliver the baby?</b>

807
00:43:44,421 --> 00:43:46,882
<b><i>Yes. Mom, how was it?</i></b>

808
00:43:47,466 --> 00:43:49,968
<b><i>Wasn't it uncomfortable
with strangers around?</i></b>

809
00:43:50,385 --> 00:43:52,512
<b><i>Let's go to a hot spring next weekend.</i></b>

810
00:43:52,596 --> 00:43:54,973
<b><i>I found a good hot spring in Gangwon-do.</i></b>

811
00:43:55,348 --> 00:43:58,226
<b>I want to hang out with them
next weekend, too.</b>

812
00:43:58,602 --> 00:43:59,603
<b><i>What?</i></b>

813
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:01,062
<b><i>Really?</i></b>

814
00:44:02,147 --> 00:44:05,484
<b>I haven't laughed this much
since I got old.</b>

815
00:44:05,650 --> 00:44:09,029
<b>I've never met people who are
as entertaining as they are my whole life.</b>

816
00:44:09,905 --> 00:44:12,908
<b>Thank you, son.</b>

817
00:44:13,158 --> 00:44:16,661
<b>Tell Jeong-won that I thanked him.</b>

818
00:44:17,329 --> 00:44:20,040
<b>I had a lot of fun in a long while.</b>

819
00:44:22,250 --> 00:44:23,168
<b>Okay.</b>

820
00:44:34,679 --> 00:44:35,847
<b>You're back already?</b>

821
00:44:37,265 --> 00:44:38,308
<b>Why did you order so much?</b>

822
00:44:38,391 --> 00:44:40,185
<b>I heard another nurse will be joining us.</b>

823
00:44:40,268 --> 00:44:43,271
<b>So there are only three of us.
We can't have all of that.</b>

824
00:45:00,914 --> 00:45:03,625
<b>She eats so much,
but she doesn't gain weight.</b>

825
00:45:03,833 --> 00:45:06,586
<b>I know. Gosh, it's so annoying.</b>

826
00:45:07,337 --> 00:45:10,340
<b>Didn't you say you were going to a musical
with your boyfriend last weekend?</b>

827
00:45:10,423 --> 00:45:12,384
<b>-Was it good?
-We broke up.</b>

828
00:45:12,551 --> 00:45:13,552
<b>Why?</b>

829
00:45:13,802 --> 00:45:16,263
<b>He suddenly asked me
how much my annual salary was.</b>

830
00:45:16,346 --> 00:45:19,307
<b>I thought he might help me
with my investments, so I told him.</b>

831
00:45:19,391 --> 00:45:21,601
<b>After that, he asked me
what my father does for a living.</b>

832
00:45:22,936 --> 00:45:25,438
<b>I thought his questions
were a bit childish.</b>

833
00:45:25,522 --> 00:45:27,440
<b>I was slightly irritated,</b>

834
00:45:27,524 --> 00:45:29,943
<b>and I began to question his intentions.</b>

835
00:45:30,026 --> 00:45:32,904
<b>I told him that my father ran
a guesthouse in Gangwon-do.</b>

836
00:45:32,988 --> 00:45:34,114
<b>And what happened?</b>

837
00:45:34,197 --> 00:45:36,491
<b>In case he thought we ran a fancy resort,</b>

838
00:45:36,575 --> 00:45:39,077
<b>I told him it was a small guesthouse
at the foot of Seoraksan.</b>

839
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:41,454
<b>His face turned grim all of a sudden.</b>

840
00:45:41,538 --> 00:45:42,789
<b>He runs a guesthouse?</b>

841
00:45:43,290 --> 00:45:45,083
<b>How nice. The view must be great.</b>

842
00:45:45,166 --> 00:45:46,751
<b>Only the view is great.</b>

843
00:45:46,835 --> 00:45:48,545
<b>Anyway, since I'm a doctor,</b>

844
00:45:48,628 --> 00:45:51,881
<b>he must have assumed I had
a lot of money and had a rich family.</b>

845
00:45:51,965 --> 00:45:53,967
<b>My gosh, he's so materialistic.</b>

846
00:45:54,050 --> 00:45:56,303
<b>Gosh, poor you, Min-ha.</b>

847
00:45:56,386 --> 00:45:57,554
<b>You're in trouble now.</b>

848
00:45:57,721 --> 00:45:59,347
<b>She has a wish, you know.</b>

849
00:45:59,431 --> 00:46:02,100
<b>She wants to have her first kiss
on Christmas wearing matching rings.</b>

850
00:46:02,767 --> 00:46:05,145
<b>Your first kiss?
I've never been kissed before, either.</b>

851
00:46:05,979 --> 00:46:07,522
<b>Are you mad?</b>

852
00:46:07,606 --> 00:46:09,608
<b>I meant the first kiss of this year. Okay?</b>

853
00:46:09,691 --> 00:46:10,692
<b>I see.</b>

854
00:46:10,775 --> 00:46:12,193
<b>You still have a lot of time.</b>

855
00:46:12,277 --> 00:46:13,653
<b>You should go on blind dates.</b>

856
00:46:14,529 --> 00:46:15,614
<b>Actually,</b>

857
00:46:15,697 --> 00:46:19,326
<b>I'm going to stop going on blind dates.</b>

858
00:46:20,243 --> 00:46:22,704
<b>I'm thinking of confessing my feelings.</b>

859
00:46:24,789 --> 00:46:25,999
<b>You have a crush?</b>

860
00:46:26,791 --> 00:46:29,878
<b>Well, you know...</b>

861
00:46:33,548 --> 00:46:34,549
<b>Yes?</b>

862
00:46:35,216 --> 00:46:36,426
<b>Okay. I got it.</b>

863
00:46:37,302 --> 00:46:40,055
<b>I just got a call saying Kim Jae-yeong
is experiencing a gross ROM.</b>

864
00:46:40,138 --> 00:46:41,765
<b>They sent her up to the delivery room.</b>

865
00:46:41,848 --> 00:46:42,891
<b>Who was that again?</b>

866
00:46:42,974 --> 00:46:45,560
<b>I told you about her once.
The really affectionate couple.</b>

867
00:46:45,644 --> 00:46:48,063
<b>The husband said he'd sing,
so the wife smacked him.</b>

868
00:46:48,146 --> 00:46:49,564
<b>Right.</b>

869
00:46:50,607 --> 00:46:52,317
<b>All right. You're doing very well.</b>

870
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:54,027
<b>Breathe quickly.</b>

871
00:46:54,110 --> 00:46:55,487
<b>Push harder.</b>

872
00:46:55,570 --> 00:46:57,697
<b>Push harder. Push.</b>

873
00:46:57,781 --> 00:47:00,450
<b>Okay. Great.</b>

874
00:47:00,742 --> 00:47:03,495
<b>Honey, you're doing so well. So great.</b>

875
00:47:08,583 --> 00:47:12,420
<b><i>Cardiothoracic surgeon needed in the ER.</i></b>

876
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:19,177
<b>The patient had a cardiac arrest
due to bradycardia.</b>

877
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:20,595
<b>I performed CPR for three minutes.</b>

878
00:47:20,679 --> 00:47:22,514
<b>His cardiac activity has been
restored for now.</b>

879
00:47:23,890 --> 00:47:25,141
<b>Let's check his ultrasound.</b>

880
00:47:28,395 --> 00:47:30,605
<b>My gosh, his heart is in awful shape.</b>

881
00:47:30,689 --> 00:47:33,566
<b>Why didn't he come to the hospital sooner?</b>

882
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:35,276
<b>He probably didn't have the money.</b>

883
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:38,154
<b>According to his colleague,
he works in logistics during the day</b>

884
00:47:38,238 --> 00:47:40,115
<b>and does deliveries
for fish markets at night.</b>

885
00:47:40,198 --> 00:47:41,866
<b>What about his guardian? Did anyone come?</b>

886
00:47:41,950 --> 00:47:43,576
<b>I talked to his father a few minutes ago.</b>

887
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:45,453
<b>He's on his way right now
from the country.</b>

888
00:47:46,037 --> 00:47:49,374
<b>When I checked, his father is receiving
chemo at our hospital.</b>

889
00:47:49,457 --> 00:47:51,793
<b>Why is he in the country
if he's doing chemo here?</b>

890
00:47:51,876 --> 00:47:53,837
<b>He works in construction.</b>

891
00:47:56,131 --> 00:47:58,383
<b>Both of them live
from paycheck to paycheck.</b>

892

<b>His colleague is already worried
about the medical bill.</b>

893
00:48:00,719 --> 00:48:01,928
<b>We'll think about that later.</b>

894
00:48:02,011 --> 00:48:03,430

<b>It's not like I've got anything better
to do at home.</b>

1050
00:59:47,633 --> 00:59:49,885
<b>Oh, right. Jeong-won's been
staying at my house.</b>

1051
00:59:49,969 --> 00:59:52,430
<b>Really? Invite me to your home.</b>

1052
00:59:52,513 --> 00:59:54,098
<b>Yes, let's pick a day. Today?</b>

1053
00:59:54,390 --> 00:59:57,560
<b>Wait, I can't do it today.
My younger sister is staying over today.</b>

1054
00:59:57,935 --> 01:00:00,271
<b>I'll try to pick another date. Gosh.</b>

1055
01:00:01,981 --> 01:00:04,567
<b>I heard that your younger sister
is in the military.</b>

1056
01:00:04,650 --> 01:00:06,026
<b>Is she good at martial arts?</b>

1057
01:00:08,028 --> 01:00:09,113
<b>A total of 15 degrees.</b>

1058
01:00:24,462 --> 01:00:26,297
<b>Sixth degree in Muay Thai,
in the national team.</b>

1059
01:00:26,380 --> 01:00:28,257
<b>Fourth degree in hapkido,
third degree in kendo,</b>

1060
01:00:28,340 --> 01:00:29,842
<b>First degree in taekwondo and judo.</b>

1061
01:00:29,925 --> 01:00:33,846
<b>I heard that she's been
practicing jiu-jitsu lately.</b>

1062
01:00:33,929 --> 01:00:35,055
<b>No way.</b>

1063
01:00:35,890 --> 01:00:39,226
<b>My sister is really good at kicks.</b>

1064
01:00:39,727 --> 01:00:42,396
<b>Her kicks are amazing.
They really are something else.</b>

1065
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:45,566
<b>Guess how many kicks she can do
in a second. I'll exaggerate just a bit.</b>

1066
01:00:45,649 --> 01:00:47,067
<b>She can do 1,000 kicks. I'm serious.</b>

1067
01:00:49,612 --> 01:00:50,571
<b>You know,</b>

1068
01:00:51,405 --> 01:00:52,573
<b>your kicks...</b>

1069
01:00:54,074 --> 01:00:56,285
<b>Your right kicks...</b>

1070
01:00:57,536 --> 01:00:58,537
<b>They're deadly.</b>

1071
01:00:59,205 --> 01:01:00,581
<b>I thought you were a robber.</b>

1072
01:01:00,664 --> 01:01:03,209
<b>What kind of a robber punches in
the door code when entering?</b>

1073
01:01:03,292 --> 01:01:04,376
<b>A new kind of robber?</b>

1074
01:01:07,505 --> 01:01:08,923
<b>Do you want more kimchi?</b>

1075
01:01:26,065 --> 01:01:27,233
<b>My goodness.</b>

1076
01:01:35,783 --> 01:01:37,076
<b>So you're leaving at dawn?</b>

1077
01:01:37,159 --> 01:01:39,954
<b>Yes. I'm taking the first bus.
I have to be there by 8 a.m.</b>

1078
01:01:40,913 --> 01:01:43,249
<b>Have you ever gone on a blind date
with a celebrity?</b>

1079
01:01:44,375 --> 01:01:45,834
<b>Where did that come from?</b>

1080
01:01:45,918 --> 01:01:49,380
<b>The groom at the wedding turned out
to be the CEO of an entertainment agency.</b>

1081
01:01:49,463 --> 01:01:51,257
<b>And his agency signed only one actress.</b>

1082
01:01:51,423 --> 01:01:52,967
<b>She even came to the wedding.</b>

1083
01:01:53,050 --> 01:01:55,719
<b>She asked me
if I was Ik-jun's younger sister.</b>

1084
01:01:57,027 --> 01:02:00,364
<b>The groom at the wedding turned out

01:02:00,447 --> 01:02:02,241
<b>And his agency signed only one actress.</b>

1086
01:02:02,408 --> 01:02:03,951
<b>She even came to the wedding.</b>

1087
01:02:04,034 --> 01:02:06,704
<b>She asked me
if I was Ik-jun's younger sister.</b>

1088
01:02:07,788 --> 01:02:10,082
<b>-Is this the actress?
-Yes, that's her.</b>

1089
01:02:10,749 --> 01:02:12,668
<b>She was gorgeous in person.</b>

1090
01:02:12,751 --> 01:02:14,211
<b>And she had a good personality, too.</b>

1091
01:02:15,504 --> 01:02:17,631
<b>Did you really go on a blind date
with an actress?</b>

1092
01:02:17,715 --> 01:02:18,591
<b>Should I tell her?</b>

1093
01:02:23,012 --> 01:02:24,180
<b>We used to date.</b>

1094
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:27,850
<b>Oh, my <i>gat</i> kimchi.</b>

1095
01:02:27,933 --> 01:02:29,143
<b>You're not lying, right?</b>

1096
01:02:29,226 --> 01:02:30,853
<b>Weren't you a public health doctor, then?</b>

1097
01:02:30,936 --> 01:02:32,938
<b>I was in the fourth year of my residency.</b>

1098
01:02:33,022 --> 01:02:34,982
<b>After seeing me on <i>Good Doctors</i>
for five seconds,</b>

1099
01:02:35,065 --> 01:02:36,775
<b>she had a crush on me and called me.</b>

1100
01:02:36,859 --> 01:02:38,527
<b>I don't believe it.</b>

1101
01:02:38,611 --> 01:02:40,154
<b>I used to be pretty popular back then.</b>

1102
01:02:40,654 --> 01:02:41,655
<b>Why did you break up?</b>

1103
01:02:41,739 --> 01:02:44,074
<b>If you had tied the knot,
you would've been happily married.</b>

1104
01:02:44,158 --> 01:02:47,119
<b>-You wouldn't have met that ex of yours.
-Then, I wouldn't have U-ju.</b>

1105
01:02:47,870 --> 01:02:48,746
<b>Goodness.</b>

1106
01:02:48,829 --> 01:02:50,873
<b>But seriously,
why did you break up with her?</b>

1107
01:02:50,956 --> 01:02:53,584
<b>She even came to Changwon
when you were a public health doctor.</b>

1108
01:02:55,794 --> 01:02:56,962
<b>She wouldn't eat.</b>

1109
01:02:57,296 --> 01:02:58,672
<b>-What?
-What are you talking about?</b>

1110
01:02:58,756 --> 01:03:00,716
<b>When we met, she never ate.</b>

1111
01:03:02,176 --> 01:03:05,221
<b>And it looked like she was
addicted to sleeping pills.</b>

1112
01:03:05,512 --> 01:03:07,306
<b>When I woke up
to go to work in the morning,</b>

1113
01:03:07,389 --> 01:03:09,225
<b>she would go to sleep then.</b>

1114
01:03:09,308 --> 01:03:13,103
<b>It felt like she lived in
a different world from me.</b>

1115
01:03:14,230 --> 01:03:15,856
<b>Of course, in the end, she dumped me.</b>

1116
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:18,984
<b>Are you serious? You really dated her?</b>

1117
01:03:19,068 --> 01:03:19,985
<b>I'm serious.</b>

1118
01:03:20,194 --> 01:03:22,404
<b>You never believe me anything I say.</b>

1119
01:03:22,488 --> 01:03:24,156
<b>Even if it's the most obvious truth.</b>

1120
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:26,992
<b>You should have earned my trust
when you had the time.</b>

1121
01:03:28,410 --> 01:03:29,828
<b>Where am I sleeping tonight?</b>

1122
01:03:30,037 --> 01:03:32,039
<b>-Let me sleep in your room.
-No.</b>

1123
01:03:32,373 --> 01:03:34,375
<b>-Sleep in Jun-wan's room.
-With him?</b>

1124
01:03:34,458 --> 01:03:35,876
<b>Are you crazy?</b>

1125
01:03:36,502 --> 01:03:38,295
<b>Jun-wan will sleep on the sofa.</b>

1126
01:03:39,713 --> 01:03:41,632
<b>Oh, gosh.</b>

1127
01:03:42,633 --> 01:03:44,718
<b>Sometimes, you're so fake.</b>

1128
01:03:45,928 --> 01:03:47,012
<b>You're spot-on.</b>

1129
01:04:09,743 --> 01:04:11,287
<b>Hello? Who is this?</b>

1130

01:04:14,999 --> 01:04:16,000
<b><i>Is it you, Jun-wan?</i></b>

1133
01:04:16,083 --> 01:04:18,419
<b>Is this your phone, Ik-sun?</b>

1134
01:04:18,502 --> 01:04:20,921
<b><i>I must have left it at home.
I thought I left it in the taxi.</i></b>

1135

<b><i>My gosh. What a relief.</i></b>

1136
01:04:22,840 --> 01:04:24,883
<b>-Where are you now?

01:08:31,505 --> 01:08:33,966
<b>"Screw you. I won't let you be happy.
Over my dead body."</b>

1200
01:08:34,466 --> 01:08:36,552
<b>I do understand her</b>

1201
01:08:37,636 --> 01:08:39,805
<b>but refusing to divorce him isn't right.</b>

1202
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:45,811
<b>Could you persuade your mother?</b>

1203
01:08:46,353 --> 01:08:48,230
<b>I think she'd at least listen to her son.</b>

1204
01:08:49,439 --> 01:08:50,649
<b>I don't want to.</b>

1205
01:09:11,128 --> 01:09:12,254
<b>I am...</b>

1206
01:09:12,879 --> 01:09:14,673
<b>pregnant.</b>

1207
01:09:15,966 --> 01:09:17,718
<b>I'm three months pregnant already.</b>

1208

<b>Let's not choose the difficult path
for all of us.</b>

1209
01:09:22,389 --> 01:09:24,558
<b>I know that she despises me,</b>

1210
01:09:25,058 --> 01:09:27,352
<b>but how long can she keep this up?
She's throwing a tantrum.</b>

1211
01:09:28,478 --> 01:09:30,355
<b>I heard she's not well.</b>

1212
01:09:32,608 --> 01:09:34,818
<b>What's the point of hating a girl like me?</b>

1213
01:09:38,196 --> 01:09:39,865
<b>Let's be adults about this.</b>

1214
01:09:39,948 --> 01:09:42,951
<b>We should do what must be done
for both parties</b>

1215
01:09:43,619 --> 01:09:45,120
<b>and settle things once and for all.</b>

<b>We have a long life ahead of us.</b>

<b>I trust that you'll talk to your mother.</b>

1218

<b>You're a smart man.</b>

1219
01:10:05,432 --> 01:10:08,018
<b>If you didn't feel any lumps before</b>

1220
01:10:08,101 --> 01:10:10,395
<b>and you suddenly feel a big lump,</b>

1221
01:10:10,896 --> 01:10:14,441
<b>it could be a sign of bad news.</b>

1222
01:10:15,859 --> 01:10:18,153
<b>From the way the lump felt,</b>

1223
01:10:18,987 --> 01:10:20,947
<b>it was quite firm.</b>

1224
01:10:21,031 --> 01:10:23,533
<b>And when you look at its shape,</b>

1225
01:10:25,410 --> 01:10:27,371
<b>it's spiky as you can see here.</b>

1226
01:10:27,704 --> 01:10:30,290
<b>And there's a shadow in the back here.</b>

1227
01:10:31,458 --> 01:10:33,168
<b>The shape is irregular.</b>

1228
01:10:35,128 --> 01:10:36,296
<b>In this case,</b>

1229
01:10:36,755 --> 01:10:38,965
<b>it's better to get a biopsy.</b>

1230
01:10:39,758 --> 01:10:42,386
<b>Why don't you get the biopsy today?</b>

1231
01:10:45,722 --> 01:10:47,974
<b>I have a job.</b>

1232
01:10:48,058 --> 01:10:49,351
<b>How long will it take?</b>

1233
01:10:49,434 --> 01:10:51,061
<b>About 20 minutes.</b>
