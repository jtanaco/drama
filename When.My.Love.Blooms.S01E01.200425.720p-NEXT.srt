You must really be careful. The atmosphere is really bad.

Frigid?

17

Their goods are much cheaper.

25
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,680
That's why I hate them. That's why I got fired.

Why work at a supermarket?

28
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:26,620
- Because I have a record. - A record?

Not a ghost. A special visitor.

A morning spider means a special visitor.

Evening spiders mean robbers.

36

I must see the chairman first.

172
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,420
Dismissal is death! Cancel the dismissal!

173
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:12,790
- Cancel! Cancel! - Cancel! Cancel!

174
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:14,760
Mayflies only live for one day.

175
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,960
- Have some water. - We last two years.

176
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,760
That's how long our contracts last.

177
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:21,860
Anyone who works for over two years becomes a regular employee.

178
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:23,730
So the company fires us after two years.

179
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:25,130
We cry and beg...

180
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:27,840
and fight, but we keep getting fired.

181
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,940
That's how we spend those two years.

182
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:31,310
In fear.

183
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:33,070
Cancel the unfair dismissal!

184
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:35,280
- Cancel! Cancel! - Cancel! Cancel!

185
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,980
Cancel the unfair dismissal!

186
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:39,640
- Cancel! Cancel! - Cancel! Cancel!

187
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:42,050
Cancel the unfair dismissal!

188
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:44,020
- Cancel! Cancel! - Cancel! Cancel!

189
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,750
Cancel the unfair dismissal!

190
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,720
- Cancel! Cancel! - Cancel! Cancel!

191
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,420
Cancel the unfair dismissal!

192
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:51,190
- Cancel! Cancel! - Cancel! Cancel!

193
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:52,960
Cancel the unfair dismissal!

194
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,800
- Cancel! Cancel! - Cancel! Cancel!

195
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,460
Cancel the unfair dismissal!

196
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:58,460
- Cancel! - Cancel!

197
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:01,800
What an eventful welcome ceremony.

198
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,410
Even if it were sewage and not an egg,

199
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:06,710
I'd have laughed like a lunatic.

200
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:09,010
It's my first day back in society.

201
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:11,980
Spending time behind bars is no easy feat.

202
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:15,080
- You did well. - Not at all.

203
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,590
Do you want to return to work?

204
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:19,690
I've been away for so long that I am a bit anxious.

205
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:21,650
Then go to the supermarket.

206
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,590
I put Seo Kyung in charge,

207
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:25,560
but I'm not sure she'll manage.

208
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:29,500
Four years will pass in no time.

209
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,430
Take the fall and hang in there for four years.

210
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:35,470
Then I'll make you my successor.

211
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:41,340
The women protesting down there.

212
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:44,640
I want them out of my sight.

213
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:49,150
You're the best at getting rid of people.

214
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:54,250
Why do you think they call you Scissorhands?

215
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,020
Yes, sir.

216
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:00,630
Jae Hyun.

217
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:03,560
Just because the hound brought back the hare,

218
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:07,000
did you ever see a hunter let the hound keep it?

219
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:10,930
A hound must eat what a hound eats.

220
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:13,970
If it wants the hare,

221
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,440
wouldn't the hunter get angry?

222
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:19,680
Yes.

223
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,380
You don't have to work right away.

224
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:27,250
You need to play some.

225
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:28,960
You always worked,

226
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,890
so did you forget how to play?

227
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:35,990
I'm not sure what to do, but I'll give it a go.

228
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:39,530
I'm a pretty quick learner.

229
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:48,740
Let's try living like a rock

230
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:54,980
Even if the wind and rain pound

231
00:20:54,980 --> 00:21:01,160
We will not fall for any trick or lure

232
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:07,520
Let's try living like a rock

233
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,260
Hey, Young Min.

234
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:13,430
Shall I bring something tasty this weekend?

235
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:18,670
(Murderous Company)

236
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:21,400
Young Min, sorry. I'll call you back.

237
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:28,020
Thank you.

238
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,780
Not at all.

239
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:32,790
I'll stick this together and bring it back.

240
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:36,690
Don't bother. I should do that. This is about my son.

241
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:38,690
I have a son too.

242
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:41,160
So I want to help you.

243
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,130
They're such bad people.

244
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:48,840
What do the youth do to play?

245
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:52,270
They play games or drink alcohol.

246
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:55,010
Guys go and play billiards.

247
00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:57,780
You say the landscape gets remodelled in four years,

248
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:59,640
so why hasn't that changed?

249
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:03,480
I don't know. How about a movie?

250
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,280
Some nice ones are out.

251
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,550
I don't like that.

252
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,920
Things like movies.

253
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:16,160

(Hye Jung)

256
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:33,280
Call someone. Like the security guy.

257
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:37,920
I may be a mom with no femininity left in me,

258
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:40,950
but I don't want to advertise that I live alone.

259
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:43,420
How do you live alone when you're that timid?

260
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:45,290
It's fine.

261
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:47,890
I don't do much at night anyway.

262
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:51,430
I'll watch some TV then sleep early.

263
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,440
I can see just fine with some candles.

264
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,870
You sound like a madam from the Joseon era.

265
00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:58,770
Why don't you just catch fireflies?

266
00:22:58,770 --> 00:23:02,010
It's nice and cozy, like a cinema.

267
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:04,950
While others went to clubs,

268
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:06,710
you went to cinemas to watch movies.

269
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:09,250
Now you don't go near one.

270
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:11,220
Movie tickets are a waste of money.

271
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:13,390
They show it all on TV after a while.

272
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:15,590
I'm sick of your stories, so stop.

273
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:18,560
Hang in there for a few days and I'll fix it for you.

274
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,790
Will you?

Tomorrow at 3pm.

(Hendrix, Guitars, Amplifiers)

286
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:20,380
How will I recognise you, Dampopo?

287
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:24,210
I'll be in a white hoodie.

288
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,190
- Excuse me. - Excuse me.

289
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:46,670
Do you want "Love Letter" too?

290
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:51,650
You placed an order first.

291
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:53,350
Why are you just leaving?

292
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:54,920
You can have it.

293
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,780
You ordered it because you want to watch.

294
00:25:57,780 --> 00:26:00,480
I'd feel bad to keep it for myself.

295
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,060
- Then what? - Let's watch together.

296
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:04,490
Dampopo said that...

297
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:07,360
the video will be too grainy if he makes another copy.

298
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:10,130
- Or if you watch it too much. - Forget it.

299
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,030
I won't tell anyone.

300
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:15,400
No one would believe me anyway.

301
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,840
Who'd believe that...

302
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:19,740
a hardcore protester watches sad Japanese movies?

303
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:22,340
Don't you speak Korean? I said forget it.

304
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:49,800
I want to watch "Love Letter" with you.

("Love Letter")

306
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:39,280
What are you doing?

307
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:43,490
It's a habit. I tend to exercise my fingers when I can.

308
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:45,560
It's distracting.

309
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:47,490
Okay.

310
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,300
That's dirty.

311
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:30,100
I always have a runny nose when you're around.

312
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,780
You saw me crying my eyes out twice.

313
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:39,380
That means you saw me at my worst.

314
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:41,740
- So you must take responsibility... - It's over. Leave.

315
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,750
Okay.

316
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:48,750
Wasn't the soundtrack of the movie good?

317
00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:52,190
I can play pieces like that too.

318
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:55,730
There's this favourite piece I've been playing a lot lately.

319
00:28:56,730 --> 00:28:58,500
Do you want to listen to it?

320
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,130
No.

321
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:02,040
That's a shame.

322
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,400
My fourth period on Wednesday is free,

323
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:07,070
so I always practice it in Room 301 at the Music Hall.

324
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:09,910
Forget it. Thanks for the movie.

325
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:14,380
When can I see you again?

326
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:15,520
What do you mean?

327
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,380
- When will we meet? - Why must we?

328
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:20,520
Because I want to see you.

329
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:22,760
Just go.

330
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,990
Why don't we date?

331
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:26,790
I'm busy.

332
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:29,500
Exactly. Why do you join the protests when you're a student?

333
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:31,730
Other people just stick to one thing.

334
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:34,330
Is that something I should be criticized for?

335
00:29:34,570 --> 00:29:36,100
Let me join you too.

336
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:37,300
With my studies or the campaign?

00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:38,540
The campaign.

338
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:40,440
I like doing campaigns too.

339
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,940
Right. When I was young, I used to compete in horse racing.

340
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:48,180
I'm running this campaign to get rid of bourgeois like you.

341
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:50,620
Your parents taught you horse riding and invested a lot to raise you.

342
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:52,890
If they find out you're joining the campaign,

343
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:54,960
your parents must be thrilled.

344
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,260
They didn't do that.

345
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:58,760
Which bus are you taking?

346
00:29:58,760 --> 00:29:59,890
Bus 12.

347
00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:01,520
It's here.

348
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:04,790
(Gaepo-dong to the entrance to Yonsei University)

349
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:14,340
(Gaepo-dong to the entrance to Yonsei University)

350
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,410
I won't give up.

351
00:30:18,410 --> 00:30:20,180
So you should give up instead!

352
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:23,710
I'll date you even if it means death!

353
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:42,960
Is it "Love Letter" again?

354
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,960
How could you watch a movie as soon as you come out?

355
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:52,240
That didn't mean you should turn it off.

356
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:55,040
Anyway, welcome back.

357
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,840
It must've been tough.

358
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:59,050
It must've been tough all by yourself too.

359
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:01,210
I'm sorry I couldn't pick you up in the afternoon.

360
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:03,910
It's okay. It's not like I came back with a gold medal.

361
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:07,350
And you must be busy now that you're the CEO.

362
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:10,620
That reminds me.

363
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:12,620
I'm going to Hawaii tomorrow.

364
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:14,730
- Hawaii? - It's not a personal trip.

365
00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:16,160
It's a business trip.

366
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,890
To Hawaii?

367
00:32:17,930 --> 00:32:20,300
I'm going there to research the industry if our supermarket...

368
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:22,200
can launch there.

369
00:32:26,170 --> 00:32:28,210
Okay. Have a safe trip.

370
00:32:28,210 --> 00:32:30,310
I'm really not going there for pleasure.

371
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:32,540
Okay. I got it.

372
00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:37,980
Oh, right. I need to ask you to do something.

373
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,750
It's about Jun Seo.

374
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:42,520
Can you pay more attention to him?

375
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:46,620
Don't you feel bad that he was away from his father for four years?

376
00:32:46,930 --> 00:32:48,800
It doesn't matter how much I'm there for him,

377
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,330
but you said boys always need their fathers.

378
00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:53,900
I'll do my best, but...

379
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:56,070
I'll be busy too.

380
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:58,240
But you said you wouldn't come back to work right away.

381
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,070
I'm going to have fun...

382
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,710
to the fullest.

383
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,570
He made you stay in the slammer for four years.

384
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:05,470
Now, he's giving you the finger.

385
00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:06,470
Unbelievable.

386
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:09,110
He said he'd make you the vice chairman of the headquarters.

387
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:10,880
How could you be the vice chairman of a supermarket?

388
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,550
It's the opposite. I'm grateful...

389
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,450
because he's doing exactly what I expected of him.

390
00:34:14,450 --> 00:34:17,250
In the end, it's Hyung Sung Supermarket.

391
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:18,890
That's the last of the succession process.

392
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:21,680
It's the biggest in the corporate governance structure.

393
00:34:22,990 --> 00:34:24,850
And did you do what I asked you?

394
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:27,690
I delivered the materials...

395
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:29,700
to the inspection agency of the media agencies.

396
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:31,430
I did what I asked,

397
00:34:31,430 --> 00:34:34,570
but what's our ammunition?

398
00:34:34,570 --> 00:34:36,440
Shares or real bullets. We don't have anything.

399
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:39,740
Pandora's box or the Trojan horse.

400
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:42,040
Can you put it in layman's terms?

401
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:44,610
Whether Pandora's box opens...

402
00:34:44,610 --> 00:34:48,040
or the enemies spill out from the Trojan horse,

403
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:50,650
can they just sit back and watch?

404
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:52,350
Causing a scene and forcing the enemies...

405
00:34:52,350 --> 00:34:53,850
to make their next move...

406
00:34:53,850 --> 00:34:56,350
is our ammunition and weapon.

407
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:57,790
Do you understand that now?

408
00:34:57,790 --> 00:34:59,890
I see.

409
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:07,130
By the way, I took a photo of your wife.

410
00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:09,330
- A photo? - Yes.

411
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:40,420
Sir.

412
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:46,500
I'm sorry.

413
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:49,200
- Where were we? - Are you all right?

414
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,930
Hold on.

415
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:16,530
My son, what did you have for dinner?

416
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:17,930
Rice.

417
00:37:17,930 --> 00:37:19,230
What about the side dishes?

418
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:21,100
Frogs?

419
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:24,270
Mom, I need to do my homework.

420
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:27,910
Fine. You never show me your affection.

421
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:29,740
You can hang up.

422
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:49,090
My gosh. My hands slipped.

423
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:52,190
I'm sorry, Smart Pauper.

424
00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:55,230
I should go get my lunch again.

425
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:20,090
Now, we're mothers of the same international middle school.

426
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:21,690
Let's support our children...

427
00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:24,530
and fix any problems together should they arise at school.

428
00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:26,470
Sure. Don't worry.

429
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:28,370
There won't be any problems at school.

430
00:38:28,370 --> 00:38:30,930
- Everyone comes from a good family. - Yes.

431
00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:34,540
School violence is always done by kids from poor families.

432
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:36,540
- That's right. - Yes.

433
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:37,910
By the way,

434
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:41,510
I heard Young Min got first place for the finals again.

435
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:44,880
He always got first place ever since he started school.

436
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,380
I heard you studied piano in college.

437
00:38:47,690 --> 00:38:49,720
What does his father do?

438
00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:50,860
Actually...

439
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:53,130
He's a lawyer in Gangnam.

440
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:55,430
- Lawyer? - No wonder.

441
00:38:55,430 --> 00:38:58,400
I don't know about other stuff, but intelligence runs in the family.

442
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,800
- Right. - Right?

443
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,530
Sometimes, rich people can be more frugal.

444
00:39:01,530 --> 00:39:04,600
You're giving us cookies to celebrate your son's grades?

445
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:07,910
You must have your work cut out for you too.

446
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:09,040
Thanks to your son, the top student,

447
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,140
you have to chair the parents' committee.

448
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:14,380
I don't think she's the type to chat like we do.

449
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:16,780
- Don't make us sound so crude. - My gosh.

450
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:20,120
No, you can't. What are you doing?

451
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:24,920
I just heard Hwa Jin is dead.

452
00:39:25,890 --> 00:39:30,260
- My comrade has vanished - My comrade has vanished

453
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:35,500
- Only the flag flaps in the wind - Only the flag flaps in the wind

454
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:41,110
- Until the new era emerges - Until the new era emerges

455
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:45,570
- Let's not be weak - Let's not be weak

456
00:39:46,410 --> 00:39:51,420
- Time may pass by - Time may pass by

457
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:56,090
- The universe will know - The universe will know

458
00:39:56,460 --> 00:40:01,460
- After waking up, we will scream - After waking up, we will scream

459
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:06,060
- At the top of our lungs - At the top of our lungs

460
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:09,900
It's been a while.

461
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,600
You look great.

462
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:15,640
Is it because you married a rich girl?

463
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:18,270
You still look better than ever even after staying in prison.

464
00:40:18,410 --> 00:40:20,580
I just feel bad for the one who passed.

465
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:22,010
Everyone seems to have a great life.

466
00:40:22,010 --> 00:40:23,810
Hey, Kyung Ho.

467
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:25,420
I get how you must feel.

468
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:27,420
You weren't going to follow through.

469
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:30,320
Why did you get her involved?

470
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:35,890
She would've gotten the scholarship for four years in college...

471
00:40:35,930 --> 00:40:38,930
and been a great officer of the law if you didn't get her involved.

472
00:40:38,930 --> 00:40:40,700
My foolish wife had...

473
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:43,570
a hard time leading the labour movement.

474
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:47,810
Couldn't you have asked her why at least?

475
00:40:47,810 --> 00:40:49,610
It had been 20 years...

476
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:51,780
since she saw her old crush.

477
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:53,580
If you thought about the feeling she had to ask for money...

478
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:56,610
even for a minute, you wouldn't have done that.

479
00:40:57,220 --> 00:41:00,150
So are you saying that Hwa Jin died...

480
00:41:01,690 --> 00:41:04,590
- because of me? - That's right, you jerk.

481
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:14,360
I saw your interview in a magazine.

482
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,970
Even I was proud of you.

483
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:20,140
Is that why you came to see me?

484
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:22,240
Well,

485
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,780
no.

486
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:26,440
Then, what is it?

487
00:41:29,450 --> 00:41:31,880
Can you lend me some money, Jae Hyun?

488
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:34,420
Kyung Ho and I...

489
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:37,920
have bad credit scores, so we can't take out a loan.

490
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:40,190
And we can't take out private loans anymore.

491
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:43,590
Can you accept money from me?

492
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:48,930
It looks like your civic group reported me and the company...

493
00:41:49,170 --> 00:41:51,730
I work for to the Ministry of Labour.

494
00:41:52,570 --> 00:41:54,670
Actually, all of my money...

495
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,140
is from the company.

496
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:01,410
I see.

497
00:42:01,550 --> 00:42:03,910
I came to the wrong person.

498
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:13,590
I'm sorry. Things have been messy for me too.

499
00:42:15,630 --> 00:42:18,490
- How much do you need? - Forget it.

500
00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:20,600
I don't need it.

501
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:23,300
No, you're right.

502
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:25,800
I cannot take...

503
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:27,870
that dirty money from you.

Ji Su.

508
00:43:25,870 --> 00:43:27,730
It was cancer.

509
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:29,730
She didn't have money,

510
00:43:30,670 --> 00:43:32,630
so she couldn't get the surgery in time.

511
00:43:37,610 --> 00:43:39,340
Didn't...

512
00:43:40,210 --> 00:43:42,380
she have a child?

513
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:44,650
Yes.

514
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:47,750
She had an eight-year-old son.

515
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:51,520
She...

516
00:43:53,690 --> 00:43:55,620
must have been in a lot of pain.

517
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,760
The pain must've been unbearable.

518
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:07,270
I'm regretting for the first time...

519
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:13,840
that I cut my ties with them and left.

520
00:44:15,850 --> 00:44:17,710
If I didn't,

521
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:22,120
I could have been able to spend more time with her.

522
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,650
Back then,

523
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:26,860
you had no choice.

524
00:44:29,030 --> 00:44:31,860
In 1, 2, 3.

Even when we take photos, we get three seconds to get ready.

526

But this kind of farewell doesn't give us any time.

527
00:44:42,810 --> 00:44:44,970
And there's no warning...

528
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:47,280
or hint.

529
00:44:48,550 --> 00:44:50,850
We're helpless.

530
00:44:54,090 --> 00:44:56,450
When I left,

531
00:44:58,490 --> 00:45:00,430
is this how other people must have felt?

532
00:45:00,430 --> 00:45:02,660
This isn't the same thing.

533
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:05,730
Stop beating yourself for it.

534
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:12,830
I'm sure she went to a nice place.

535
00:45:14,310 --> 00:45:16,370
She did a lot of good deeds.

536

Around my age, there are no happy occasions.

537
00:45:30,390 --> 00:45:32,790
There are only bad occasions.

538
00:45:34,590 --> 00:45:38,000
So you should get your medical checkups diligently.

539
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,200
Isn't that the only report card we'll get now?

540
00:45:41,370 --> 00:45:44,270
It shows us the kind of life we have been leading so far.

541
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,970
And we can sort of see what kind of future we'll have.

542
00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:49,970
I'm not scared of such report cards.

543
00:45:50,310 --> 00:45:52,070
Then, what are you scared of?

544
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:54,980
Let's say that we miraculously meet again.

545
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:58,350
But I'm scared...

546
00:45:58,620 --> 00:46:00,520
it might be at her funeral.

547
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:03,550
Are you talking about Yoon Ji Su?

548
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:09,860
Hey, don't you know she's young? It's too early for her funeral.

549
00:46:09,930 --> 00:46:12,200
Hwa Jin was too young to die as well.

550
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:13,900
And besides,

551
00:46:14,230 --> 00:46:16,170
I looked everywhere, but I couldn't find her.

552
00:46:16,170 --> 00:46:18,940
Are you in the NIS? CIA?

553
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:20,310
How can you find everyone you want?

554
00:46:20,310 --> 00:46:22,240
I'm sure she's hiding somewhere.

555
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:24,140
Is that so?

556
00:46:24,140 --> 00:46:29,350
Hey, don't you know that she was clever?

557
00:46:29,350 --> 00:46:32,490
People think she's delicate because she looks weak.

558
00:46:32,490 --> 00:46:36,690
When she was in college, she was a total warrior.

559
00:46:36,690 --> 00:46:40,460
She was like Black Widow. The one who roams around in tights.

560
00:46:40,460 --> 00:46:42,460
My gosh, she scares me.

561
00:46:48,170 --> 00:46:50,000
Engineer majors are the best!

562
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,670
I didn't learn to switch lights in college.

563
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:55,540
Is this how you utilize this top-level labour force?

564

I'll cook you something delicious.

565
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:01,640
The protest pays nothing. When will you keep that up?

566
00:47:01,810 --> 00:47:05,150
You're so consistent. You never liked protests.

567
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:08,050
It's because I'm a pacifist.

568
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:12,660
I don't think I can do it this year.

569
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:15,990
Nice. I'm glad to hear that.

570
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:17,130
But why all of a sudden?

571
00:47:17,130 --> 00:47:19,930
My father's caretaker wants me to raise her pay.

572
00:47:19,930 --> 00:47:23,330
Didn't you say she was the only one who could handle him?

573
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:26,440
You should be grateful for her,

574
00:47:27,110 --> 00:47:29,640
but isn't she taking advantage of that?

575
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,040
Hye Jung.

576
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:32,710
Yes?

577
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:35,140
I think I'm going to throw up.

578
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:39,480
I sit with the protesters and share a bottle of water some days...

579
00:47:39,650 --> 00:47:42,220
and others, I hang around with mothers who buy clothes...

580
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:44,220
that are a month's worth of living for the protesters,

581
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:47,590
eating brunch at a hotel and chatting.

582
00:47:47,590 --> 00:47:49,760
I feel so queasy.

583
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:53,090
That's why you need to stick to one thing.

584
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:55,370
That way you won't get confused.

585
00:47:55,370 --> 00:47:58,870
I can't give up on the protesters,

586
00:47:58,870 --> 00:48:01,070
and when I think of Young Min,

587
00:48:01,070 --> 00:48:03,940
I can't say no to the mothers, either.

588
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:08,110
That's why I have to put on a mask and play the piano.

589
00:48:10,450 --> 00:48:13,720
Whoever said you get focused when you reach 40...

590
00:48:13,950 --> 00:48:16,660
should be given a beating.

591
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:18,960
We're all going crazy.

592
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:20,920
Who the heck is focused?

593
00:48:22,530 --> 00:48:24,930
When I reach 40,

594
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:28,170
I thought I would be sitting elegantly in a massage chair,

595
00:48:28,170 --> 00:48:30,140
looking at travel brochures,

596
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:31,970
rubbing oil all over my body...

597
00:48:31,970 --> 00:48:35,740
in a heavenly beach,

598
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:37,410
and getting a tan.

599
00:48:37,410 --> 00:48:39,770
Gosh, life.

600
00:48:40,310 --> 00:48:42,680
I do visit heaven often.

Yes, I'm sorry.

605
00:48:59,130 --> 00:49:01,330
Your son attends an international middle school, right?

606
00:49:01,330 --> 00:49:04,470
Gosh, that must cost a fortune.

607
00:49:04,470 --> 00:49:07,010
Isn't that a bit out of your league?

608
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:09,070
- Haven't you heard? - What?

609
00:49:09,070 --> 00:49:10,610
He won several times...

610
00:49:10,610 --> 00:49:12,080
at international Olympiads,

611
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:15,810
so the school gave him a full scholarship.

612
00:49:15,810 --> 00:49:18,180
- They even pay for the expenses. - Goodness.

613

Is that so?

614
00:49:19,490 --> 00:49:21,490
Then you should go and look after him...

615
00:49:21,490 --> 00:49:22,860
instead of sitting around like this.

What happened? Where did you get hurt?

644

Did you get hurt anywhere else?

- No. - Then tell me.

What happened?

647
00:54:10,210 --> 00:54:13,210
There's this poor kid,

648
00:54:13,550 --> 00:54:15,350
and he suddenly went crazy...

649

652

Yes. I didn't do anything.

667
00:55:26,420 --> 00:55:28,390
but the plaintiff, Yoon Ji Su,

668
00:55:28,390 --> 00:55:30,090
denies any monetary compensation,

669
00:55:30,090 --> 00:55:32,960
including alimony and child support,

670
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:35,860
and only desires custody of Lee Young Min,

671
00:55:35,860 --> 00:55:38,960
so the verdict shall be as follows.

672
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:40,030
Order.

673
00:55:40,030 --> 00:55:43,540
The custody for Lee Young Min...

674
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:46,470
will be awarded to the plaintiff, Yoon Ji Su.

675
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:48,370
The duty of alimony...

676
00:55:48,370 --> 00:55:50,410
and child support of the defendant...

677
00:55:50,410 --> 00:55:53,740
shall be exempted as the plaintiff has requested.

678
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:58,910
Is your father in a critical condition?

679
00:55:59,350 --> 00:56:01,020
Unless you're expecting any life insurance money,

680
00:56:01,020 --> 00:56:03,090
what are you relying on?

681
00:56:03,090 --> 00:56:04,760
I have no intention of raising Young Min...

682
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:05,960
with you or your mother's money.

683
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:09,290
I get what you're aiming at, but do you think it's possible?

684
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:12,030
If something happens to Young Min,

685
00:56:12,030 --> 00:56:14,500
I'm going to file for custody.

686
00:56:14,570 --> 00:56:16,860
I'm not giving up on you, either.

687
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:19,800
As long as we have Young Min,

688
00:56:20,170 --> 00:56:22,440
you can never get too far.

689
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:42,660
I really don't know what to say.

690
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:45,200
This is a first since the school was established.

691
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:47,570
Why don't you bring him out, first?

692
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:49,670
I think this should be between the adults.

693
00:56:49,670 --> 00:56:51,600
Yes, of course.

694
00:56:51,770 --> 00:56:54,740
Yes, sir. Young Min, let's go.

695
00:56:57,910 --> 00:57:01,480
He doesn't seem to be a bully.

696
00:57:26,610 --> 00:57:28,740
Come on in, Ms. Yoon.

697
00:57:35,180 --> 00:57:36,880
I'm sorry.

698
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:39,880
I apologize with all my heart.

699
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:05,080
If you show us mercy this once,

700
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:07,580
I will never let this happen again.

701
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:10,550
I know this is unforgivable,

702
00:58:10,550 --> 00:58:13,450
- but he is still a young student. - Ma'am,

703
00:58:14,220 --> 00:58:16,850
this isn't that simple of a matter.

704
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:19,650
The victim's father is here, so...

705
00:58:27,630 --> 00:58:31,630
Gosh, he must be so outraged.

706
00:58:33,140 --> 00:58:35,440
I'm sorry. Should I go after him?

707
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:37,170
Stay here.

708
00:58:43,350 --> 00:58:46,350
Let's not set up the School Violence Committee.

709
00:58:46,350 --> 00:58:50,320
But you just left, so I thought you were outraged.

710
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:53,060
I left because I didn't think I needed an apology.

711
00:58:53,060 --> 00:58:56,290
But this is still school violence,

712
00:58:56,290 --> 00:58:57,600
and for discipline, we should...

713
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:59,800
I'm here after seeing Jun Seo.

714
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:03,260
It's nothing to worry about so please end it here.

715
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:07,200
Young Min, you can tell me.

716
00:59:07,410 --> 00:59:10,470
There's no way you could have done this without a reason.

717
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:12,640
You wouldn't even hurt a fly,

718
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:14,580
let alone a person.

719
00:59:16,780 --> 00:59:19,950
Tell me. Did something happen?

720
00:59:20,490 --> 00:59:23,520
But am I getting kicked out?

721
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:26,220
No.

722
00:59:26,890 --> 00:59:29,190
They're letting it slide.

723
00:59:29,430 --> 00:59:31,260
You don't have to worry.

724
00:59:32,430 --> 00:59:37,200
So you really have to tell me what happened, Young Min.

725
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:40,940
Mom, I have homework to do.

726
00:59:51,220 --> 00:59:54,420
Yes, I'll be there at about midnight.

727
00:59:54,420 --> 00:59:56,050
Yes.

728
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:07,760
Then drive safely, sir.

729
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,100
No, actually, I won't be going.

730
01:00:10,100 --> 01:00:12,400
Yes, it's snowing too hard.

731
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:15,070
I'll be leaving the car here, so come and pick it up.

732
01:00:15,070 --> 01:00:16,700
All right.

733
01:01:15,070 --> 01:01:20,270
(Last train to Hwabon, 9:30pm)

734
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:54,200
I think that's mine.

735
01:02:06,520 --> 01:02:08,180
There you are.

736
01:02:09,190 --> 01:02:10,820
Yoon Ji Su.

737
01:02:30,010 --> 01:02:32,740
It's a winter wonderland here, isn't it?

738
01:02:49,290 --> 01:02:51,030
With all this happening,

739
01:02:51,930 --> 01:02:54,230
I guess I won't be getting home tonight.

740
01:03:06,850 --> 01:03:09,480
Don't worry too much about the school.

741
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:12,980
Boys get into fights all the time...

742
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:15,920
at school.

743
01:03:40,780 --> 01:03:42,480
There you are.

744
01:03:46,180 --> 01:03:47,880
Yoon Ji Su.

745
01:04:55,250 --> 01:04:58,120
(Those who fade away heartbreakingly...)

746
01:04:58,120 --> 01:05:03,130
(leave a scar-like light in the hearts...)

747
01:05:03,130 --> 01:05:07,800
(of those who knew them.)

748

(From "The Gray Snowman", by Choe Yun)

749
01:05:33,690 --> 01:05:36,190
(When My Love Blooms)

750
01:05:37,100 --> 01:05:39,100
I guess it happened...

751
01:05:39,100 --> 01:05:41,860
because it snowed. A lot.

752
01:05:41,870 --> 01:05:45,370
I wish more snow would fall. So we can't get anywhere.

753
01:05:47,070 --> 01:05:50,640
You came to me every day and I didn't even have to try.

754
01:05:50,740 --> 01:05:51,980
(I can go on because of you. Sorry and thank you.)

755
01:05:51,980 --> 01:05:54,510
That's why I could go on with life.

756
01:05:55,450 --> 01:05:58,080
- What do you think you're doing? - Let's play it by the law.

757
01:05:58,080 --> 01:06:00,250
I'm not trying to teach you a lesson.

758
01:06:00,250 --> 01:06:03,150
We just have different ways of protecting our love.
