1
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:50,110
I need you to do something for me.

2
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:53,310
You just...

3
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:56,010
have to go...

4
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:59,450
back and forth so I can see you.

5
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:02,920
The thing you said you liked looking at...

6
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:05,320
You don't mean...

7
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:06,690
Me?

8
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:11,830
I can't say exactly what this feeling is.

9
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:13,800
But...

10
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:19,100
I need you.

11
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:23,810
Can you stay?

12
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:57,910
Please stay.

13
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:04,850
(A Piece of Your Mind)

14
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,220
I have to stay.

15
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:20,130
So what? Why are you complaining to me?

16
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:22,970
Hey. I'll call you back in five minutes.

17
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:24,330
Where are you going?

18
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:26,470
- I need to go. - Look how you're dressed.

19
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,710
You're right. Not now.

20
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:35,480
Hey. Snap out of it.

21
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:40,620
Hey. Girls keep hitting on me like crazy lately.

22
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:43,950
That was a coworker just now that everyone says is pretty.

23
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:46,220
She calls when she's drunk and flirts like crazy.

24
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:48,230
Why is this happening to me lately?

25
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:50,630
No one liked me in college.

26
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:51,860
That's right.

27
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:54,000
This is so disturbing.

28
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,400
Should I answer this or not?

29
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:57,000
You say she's a coworker, so answer it.

30
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,470
If anything happens later, it's all your fault.

31
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,840
Then don't answer it.

32
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,840
Who was it, that you had to take it outside?

33
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:10,580
Well... So...

34
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:14,320
Seo Woo ran out like a crazy girl.

35
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,820
I stopped her and sent her home.

36
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:19,220
What got into her in the middle of the night?

37
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,830
I should stay for him.

38
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,570
How do I do that?

39
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:41,510
Seo Woo.

40
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,110
Seo Woo!

41
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:45,820
Han Seo Woo!

42
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:49,220
Seo Woo!

43
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:50,520
Eun Joo.

44
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,060
Let me see.

45
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:56,860
Come over here.

46
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,430
Don't get any stupid ideas.

47
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:02,430
What do you mean?

48
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:04,500
I heard you ran around like a crazy girl.

49
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,840
I did not.

50
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:08,410
Don't think about doing something rash again.

51
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:09,640
What?

52
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:15,450
I won't. Come on.

53
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:18,680
I get so nervous this time of year, with your suicidal thoughts.

54
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,150
That's not it.

55
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:21,750
I'm so sick of it.

56
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,550
Get your head on straight, got it?

57
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:27,180
Seo Woo. A bunch of young kids came today,

58
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:29,490
taking pictures and traveling.

59
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,250
It looked nice.

60
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,590
You should date too.

61
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,840
I don't know where my own things are.

62
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,310
Should I bring it to you?

63
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:54,010
No, I'll go down.

64
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:58,920
Level B-3.

65
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,620
I'm here.

66
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,920
Go to C48.

67
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:51,770
I want to play this for you,

68
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,740
Mom,

69
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:58,340
Dad.

70
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:17,790
When will you be done with work?

71
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:19,060
(When will you be done with work?)

72
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,230
You're okay, right?

73
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:25,000
I texted just because.

74
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:29,910
"How are you? Isn't the weather nice?"

75
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:33,280
I like it when I get random texts like that.

76
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:36,410
I feel cared for.

77
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,950
I'm okay.

78
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:43,120
I just saw something I like looking at,

79
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,750
so I'm in a very good mood.

80
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:55,500
I got my hopes up for nothing.

81
00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:00,640
I'm working on what to do to make it feel like...

82
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:02,140
I'm "staying" with you.

83
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,380
That's why I'm texting you for no reason.

84
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,350
Do you need anything right now?

85
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:11,780
(Before Dawn)

86
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:14,580
You usually have your head on the table when you're in the studio,

87
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:16,120
so maybe a cushion?

88
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,120
Or slippers.

89
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,860
I'm sure you need something.

90
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:44,080
I'm okay.

91
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:51,390
Guess what you often say like a habit.

92
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,290
A habit?

93
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,630
What is it?

94
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,300
"I want people to hear it."

95
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:05,540
Keep the door open so more people can hear it.

96
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,570
This is the last song we recorded here.

97
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:12,410

98

100
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:08,570
About the house concert, I think it was booked a long time ago.

101
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:11,300
- You remember, right? - I forgot about it.

102
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:13,240
I thought so.

103
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:15,410
The rehearsal is today.

104
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:18,380
If you can't make it, let them know in advance.

105
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:21,540
Soon Ho, didn't you say you were a gardener?

106
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:23,050
Yes, and I still am.

107
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:25,480
How do you throw out plants?

108
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,050
Why are you throwing them out?

109
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:29,290
- Because they're dead. - I see.

110
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:31,390
Can you send me pictures of them?

111
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:32,860
I'll check the state they're in.

112
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:36,690
(Mr. Kang)

113
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,000
Oh, gosh.

114
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,470
None of them are dead.

115
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:44,330
They're dead.

116
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:46,170
If you can't keep them,

117
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:48,300
will you send them to my farm?

118
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:51,110
- Are they in your balcony? - Yes.

119
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:53,640
The eucalyptus is missing.

120
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,810
The one you bought for your wife that time.

121
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:57,580
Eucalyptus...

122
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:01,020
What does it look like again?

123
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:05,360
We have the same one in our studio.

124
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:07,120
Seo Woo got it as a gift.

125
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,960
It was neglected and almost died,

126
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,130
but I saved it. Hold on.

127
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:12,800
Who...

128
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,770
gave it to Seo Woo?

129
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:17,400
I didn't ask her.

130
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:28,310
Ji Soo went to the studio...

131
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,910
and gave the plant to Han Seo Woo.

133
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:41,990
What's with the two of them?

134
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:49,570
The weather is so nice.

135
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:51,770
I hate it.

136
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,620
She threw...

137
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:42,950
the plant away.

138
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:43,240
I want to play it for you.

(Express Bus Timetable)

141
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:18,880
As you can see, the buildings are still ablaze...

142
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,410
as if they had been bombed.

143
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,280
Do you want to go to your house with me?

144
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:23,580
No.

145
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,350
I won't go.

146
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,520
I don't think I can.

147
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:40,660
Is it like history taking?

148
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:41,660
It's different.

149
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:43,570
You can ask more casually.

150
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:45,970
I can find its point of reaction right away.

151
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,540

Where are you?

You're where?

This is where I need to stay for you.

158

It's a huge improvement that you went to the bus terminal.

Right.

161
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,160
I can go with you.

162
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:19,960
It's okay.

163
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:24,330
I talked so big to my mom...

164
00:17:24,330 --> 00:17:26,340
that I'd bring her what I recorded.

165
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:29,370
She always asked me when I was going to,

166
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:32,310
saying she'd listen to it 1,000 times if I did.

I'll pick the best one for you.

00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,620
You'll be shocked.

173
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:52,630
This one is...

174
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:03,510
Brahms.

175
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:05,440
"Cello Sonata..."

176
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:07,740
"Number Two."

177
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:12,110
- What's next? - Next one is...

178
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,640
It's not very good.

179
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:34,970
He's a great pianist,

180
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:37,170
but he's in a slump these days.

181
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:40,310
He played this when he was slumping. You can tell?

182
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,380
I have no choice.

183
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,650
I'll have to show you my skills.

184
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:48,220
Do you play an instrument?

185
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:50,220
My mom was a piano teacher.

186
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:52,150
So you learned.

187
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:54,720
I told her that I liked listening, but hated playing,

188
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,130
so she didn't teach me.

189
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,630
I learned a little from watching, that's all.

190
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:00,700
Just wait and see.

191
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:03,200
I'll come with my recording gear next time.

192
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:06,000
I can't wait.

193
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:23,190
You look like you slept a bit,

194
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,520
or maybe not.

195
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:31,090
Once everything is resolved,

196
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:33,760
you'll be able to sleep.

197
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:36,630
Your body will send a signal.

198
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:41,970
"It's all good now. The complicated things are over."

199
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,510
Then you'll fall asleep.

200
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:48,440
Losing someone next to you.

201
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:50,750
It's tough every time you experience it.

202
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:57,190
But if you have someone, you're bound to lose them.

203
00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:01,720
And you need a way to endure it each time.

204
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,600
What was your way?

205
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,030
Well, for me,

206
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:12,800
I just needed one person who understood.

207
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:17,310
"I'm struggling. I'm lonely. Help me."

208
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:21,040
The one person who would listen every time...

209
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:23,180
if I tell them right away without hiding it.

210
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:25,250
Who was it until now?

211
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:26,680
Eun Joo.

212
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:31,790
But she's starting to get exhausted recently.

213
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:35,730
But then again, it's been a long time.

214
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:37,830
One percent.

215
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,460
And one person.

216
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:43,930
That's all you need.

217
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,750
You left all your stuff at the studio.

218
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:05,290
That's right. I only brought my phone.

219
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:07,760
Let me go with you. I left something there too.

220
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:12,400
Like your heart?

221
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:14,600
My bicycle.

222
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,970
Oh, I see.

223
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:23,670
I'm slightly concerned...

224
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:27,180
about what I should do to stay with you.

225
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:30,780
How were the texts?

226
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:33,680
Did it make you feel like someone was with you?

227
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,080
It did for me.

228
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:38,950
It's not that I want someone physically next to me,

229
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:41,290
but more like in the air around me,

230
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,460
warming my surroundings.

231
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,800
Your texts are effective.

232
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:50,600
That's good to hear.

233
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,540
I'll go inside then.

234
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,750
Bye.

235
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:07,850
- My bicycle. - Oh, right.

236
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,490
Your bicycle.

237
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,540
What's this?

238
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,750
What...

239
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:39,850
What are these?

240
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:51,560
He is so silly.

241
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:55,560
They're pretty. I love them.

242
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:17,720
Darn, he's so distracting.

243
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:21,890
In Wook, will you let me work?

244
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:24,760
I'll leave a little while later.

245
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:27,600
I can stop thinking when I'm here.

246
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,900
I see. Stay here then.

247
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:31,370
Eat and sleep here.

248
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:33,370
Don't think. That's the worst.

249
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:34,870
They can make...

250
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:37,840
your brain and heart rot away.

251
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:39,610
All right.

252
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,220
Jin Moo.

253
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:51,390
It's just a single plant,

254
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:58,990
but I feel like I'm being laid bare.

255
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,930
(Eunjoo Homestay)

256
00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:04,570
Seo Woo.

257
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:07,140
I wasn't late yesterday.

258
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:08,400
Open the door!

259
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,040
Hurry up.

260
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:11,840
Take this.

261
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:13,910
Gosh.

262
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,920
I'm so tired.

263
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,820
Hey, your face isn't covered.

264
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:31,360
Cover it back. This memorial isn't for you.

265
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,660
Whatever, it's fine.

266
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:36,330
No, cover it with something. Anything is fine.

267
00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:38,030
Do it already.

268
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:47,410
There you go. Good job.

269
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:50,050
Let's bow.

270
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:12,070
Ma'am, Seo Woo is staying in the semi-basement...

271
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:13,870
because she wants to.

272
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:16,540
I just can't change her mind.

273
00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:21,980
So don't be disappointed in me.

274
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,550
It's good now.

275
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:30,190
If I don't say this, it makes me feel uneasy all year round.

276
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:36,830
You aren't exhausted yet.

277
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:39,130
What are you saying?

278
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:44,730
What about Chang Sup? Did he not come home again last night?

279
00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:47,370
No. I guess he's very busy.

280
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:49,940
He doesn't usually pull all-nighters.

281
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:52,640
Maybe things are unusual right now.

282
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:58,710
Thanks.

283
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:03,990
How much must I talk with it to find its point of reaction?

284
00:26:04,050 --> 00:26:05,750
I haven't talked to someone for this long...

285
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:09,390
since my boyfriend when I was 22. I was up all night.

286
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:10,660
It depends.

287
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:12,330
I'm sure...

288
00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:14,860
her daughter is the point of reaction, but it's not responding.

289
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:16,730
Or it could be something unexpected.

290
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:19,500
No, I'm 100 percent sure it's her.

291
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,970
She had leukemia.

292
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:23,870
When she knew she was terminally ill, she called me...

293
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:25,810
and made an appointment for her mom.

294
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:28,610
In case my mom does something rash.

295
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:30,610
She's very weak emotionally.

296
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,950
Please see her at least once a week.

297
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:35,580
You are...

298
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:37,350
very sweet.

299
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:41,090
I envy your mom.

300
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:46,160
But Kim Min Jung never talks about her daughter.

301
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:48,460
It would be healthier for her if she did.

302
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:50,500
Her daughter did the right thing.

303
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:53,140
Things could've been bad if she was left alone.

304
00:26:53,870 --> 00:26:57,410
"I'm struggling. I'm lonely. Help me."

305
00:26:57,770 --> 00:27:01,180
The one person who would listen every time...

306
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,350
if I tell them right away without hiding it.

307
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:08,480
She vents, which means she has the will to live.

308
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,690
If she didn't have that will, she wouldn't talk at all.

309
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:15,120
People should listen to each other and help each other out.

310
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:18,930
Gosh, what in the world must I say...

311
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:21,030
for Kim Min Jung to come out?

312
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:22,930
This is so difficult.

313
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:24,570
(General Ward A)

314
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:28,340
Ms. Kim Min Jung.

315
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:31,170
You may go in now.

316
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,710
- It smells like food in here. - Sorry.

317
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:40,980
I had to eat in my office...

318
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:43,490
because I'm working on a paper.

319
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:45,450
I'm sorry.

320
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,860
- Here. - Thank you.

321
00:27:50,890 --> 00:27:54,400
What happened to the address? Are you moving?

322
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,430
I plan to.

323
00:27:57,170 --> 00:27:58,500
You didn't tell me.

324
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,370
Eunjoo Homestay? That's it?

325
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:04,170
- Do you know them? - How would I?

326
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:07,180
I need the address.

327
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:09,950
I won't stop communication and disappear.

328
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:11,880
How can I trust you?

329
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:17,050
Anyway,

330
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,660
send me the address sometime today.

331
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,120
Okay.

332
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:26,860
What shall we chat about today?

333
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:30,930
Doctor. Your teeth.

334
00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:33,540
- Sorry. Did something get stuck? - What did you eat?

335
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:54,020
I wondered how you were doing,

336
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:55,720
as well as the babies in the balcony.

337
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:57,960
If you don't mind,

338
00:28:58,090 --> 00:29:00,300
should I take all the babies in the balcony?

339
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:03,630
It's more depressing if your plants are dying.

340
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:05,300
It's okay.

341
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,470
Just throw them out.

342
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:10,340
Leave them out front, and I'll raise them.

343
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:15,940
The performer is in a slump and holed up at home,

344
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:18,350
and his plants are dying.

345
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:23,220
To be honest, I don't know how to help someone get out of a slump.

346
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:24,590
I've never seen it before.

347
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:29,260
But I know exactly how to save plants from dying.

348
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,930
At least one of you should live.

349
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:36,100
- I'll take care of... - You won't take care of it.

350
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:37,730
All you do is run away.

351
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:42,740
- Are you ready? - Let's go.

352
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:43,970
I'm ready to go.

353
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,440
She's close to my wife.

354
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,950
I don't want her saying things.

355
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:53,450
Are you actually married?

356
00:29:58,650 --> 00:29:59,860
There's the balcony.

357
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:21,340
Shall we begin?

358
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,300
Are you ready?

359
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:35,040
My gosh.

360
00:32:35,410 --> 00:32:37,380
I never said I was good.

361
00:32:37,850 --> 00:32:40,520
- I guess not. - Did you not like it?

362
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,020
Want to try one more time?

363
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:47,090
No. Mix it nicely and make it sound good.

364
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:49,390
I don't know if I'm that good.

365
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:16,150
Where to?

366
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:18,820
One to Yangnyang please.

367
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:19,990
Okay. Yangnyang.

368
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,790
Have a nice trip.

369
00:37:53,830 --> 00:37:56,100
I recorded this.

370
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:09,140
I'm doing well.

371
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:13,880
Don't worry about me.

372
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:11,470
I'm home.

373
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:15,240
Mom.

374
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:18,110
Dad.

375
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:24,910
You mixed it nicely.

376
00:40:31,790 --> 00:40:34,660
I wanted you to stay, so I should follow you around.

377
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,000
You came alone,

378
00:40:45,330 --> 00:40:47,700
so you don't mind going back together, right?

379
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:27,110
I think this time of year will get better now.

380
00:41:57,470 --> 00:41:58,740
Thank you.

381
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:09,620
Stay for dinner. I want to have the welcoming dinner now.

382
00:42:11,050 --> 00:42:12,390
Are you kidding me?

383
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:16,390
What? Because I was rude to her?

384
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:20,090
We're dating, okay? Satisfied?

385
00:42:21,130 --> 00:42:23,130
What's wrong with you? You're embarrassing me.

386
00:42:24,030 --> 00:42:25,930
Are you embarrassed of me?

387
00:42:26,230 --> 00:42:28,300
Is that why you've been so mean to me?

388
00:42:32,970 --> 00:42:34,280
Why you...

389
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:45,890
I'm really sorry.

390
00:42:45,890 --> 00:42:47,120
It's okay.

391
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:49,990
I made gimbap. Share with the others...

392
00:42:49,990 --> 00:42:51,590
It's okay. I'm late.

393
00:42:51,590 --> 00:42:53,460
What? But...

394
00:42:55,230 --> 00:42:56,860
Give me a gimbap.

395
00:42:57,130 --> 00:42:58,330
I'm hungry.

396
00:43:10,350 --> 00:43:13,050
The doctors' lounge was my home.

397
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:15,420
When I was in my 20s?

398
00:43:16,250 --> 00:43:18,320
Living in a homestay...

399
00:43:18,650 --> 00:43:20,560
and hanging out in groups...

400
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:25,230
I've never experienced that.

401
00:43:25,230 --> 00:43:28,660
Searching for details regarding...

402
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:30,730
- experiences... - Min Jung, stop.

403
00:43:32,970 --> 00:43:34,340
How's Eunjoo Homestay?

404
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:37,040
Searching for information regarding...

405
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,610
- Eunjoo Homestay... - Stop the search.

406
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:41,010
Stop with Eunjoo Homestay.

407
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:44,510
I went to see Eun Joo.

408
00:43:49,550 --> 00:43:52,690
Who's Eun Joo?

409
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:55,760
The owner of the homestay owner where I lived in my 20s.

410
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:57,530
She was full of energy.

411
00:43:57,930 --> 00:44:00,430
I feel like seeing her will give me the strength to live.

412
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:02,900
Min Jung, is that you?

413
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:05,470
My gosh.

414
00:44:05,830 --> 00:44:07,770
Why did you suddenly become Min Jung?

415
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:09,940
It's me. What's wrong with you?

416
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:15,810
Min Jung, is that you?

417
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:17,380
I told you, it is.

418
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:46,870
The person you have reached is not available.

419
00:44:46,870 --> 00:44:49,680
Please leave a message after the tone.

420
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:55,980
Seeing you...

421
00:44:56,620 --> 00:44:58,250
is making me even more depressed.

422
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:21,040
Thank you.

423
00:45:33,750 --> 00:45:34,760
(Eunjoo Homestay)

424
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:44,300
I'll go now.

425
00:45:45,030 --> 00:45:47,370
The mattress was delivered.

426
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:50,400
I brought the sofa in by myself too.

427
00:45:50,970 --> 00:45:54,210
You moved that heavy thing all by yourself?

428
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:55,640
Yes. It was really hard.

429
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:57,510
I was afraid I'd dislocate my shoulder.

430
00:45:59,710 --> 00:46:01,280
You should've...

431
00:46:02,620 --> 00:46:04,550
done that with me.

432
00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:11,560
1, 2, 3.

433
00:46:13,830 --> 00:46:15,100
Slowly.

434
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:28,110
- Here. - No, no.

435
00:46:28,110 --> 00:46:29,240
In the bedroom.

436
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:31,650
- Bedroom? - 1, 2, 3.

437
00:46:49,630 --> 00:46:52,830
Finally, the bedroom and living room have been differentiated.

438
00:46:53,530 --> 00:46:56,070
She was critical that they weren't before.

439
00:46:59,140 --> 00:47:00,610
It's the door to dreams.

440
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:05,010
The pillows are nice.

441
00:49:22,170 --> 00:49:23,340
Is there food for me?

442
00:49:24,540 --> 00:49:26,540
You said you don't eat breakfast.

443
00:49:26,940 --> 00:49:28,240
I need to eat today.

444
00:49:31,250 --> 00:49:32,510
I don't need soup.

445
00:49:33,580 --> 00:49:34,880
I'll scoop the rice for you.

446
00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:37,350
The person eating should scoop however much they want.

447
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:43,260
Chang Sup is late because of work,

448
00:49:43,620 --> 00:49:45,530
and Jin Soo is sleeping...

449
00:49:45,530 --> 00:49:46,760
I don't care.

450
00:49:53,430 --> 00:49:54,540
What's your problem?

451
00:49:55,470 --> 00:49:56,700
I said to call.

452
00:49:58,110 --> 00:49:59,210
My bad.

453
00:50:02,310 --> 00:50:03,340
Eun Joo.

454
00:50:04,810 --> 00:50:06,650
I went to my hometown.

455
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:10,590
Good girl.

456
00:50:12,290 --> 00:50:14,760
I've been feeling down since yesterday.

457
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:17,490
You're amazing.

458
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:22,830
Did you go by yourself?

459
00:50:26,930 --> 00:50:28,170
I'm so proud of you.

460
00:50:30,470 --> 00:50:32,770
I was going to eat with her because I felt sorry for her.

461
00:50:33,670 --> 00:50:35,680
- I'll be home later. - Okay.

462
00:50:47,090 --> 00:50:48,120
Where did she go?

463
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:55,500
I wonder if he's up.

464
00:51:22,990 --> 00:51:25,090
What good babies. You grew more.

465
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:28,330
What? Yes.

466
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:32,330
You're happy to have new family members?

467
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:41,840
Hey.

468
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:44,710
I have lotion and BB cream.

469
00:51:45,350 --> 00:51:47,820
- You can use them all. - Thank you.

470
00:51:48,350 --> 00:51:49,980
You didn't go home?

471
00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:51,590
Good for you.

472
00:51:51,590 --> 00:51:54,120
The studio has no business, but good for you.

473
00:52:53,510 --> 00:52:54,620
Where are the chairs?

474
00:52:55,450 --> 00:52:56,820
Why would we have chairs?

475
00:52:57,220 --> 00:52:58,320
Then do people listen standing up?

476
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:00,420
It's a house. They lie down.

477
00:53:00,590 --> 00:53:02,090
Everyone brings a pillow.

478
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:04,760
That's why it's in a house?

479
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:06,290
You almost fooled me.

480
00:53:07,230 --> 00:53:08,360
Seo Woo,

481
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:10,600
why are you in such a good mood that you're being so silly?

482
00:53:10,830 --> 00:53:13,300
She's full of energy too. She's carrying everything.

483
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:15,770
I went to my hometown yesterday.

484
00:53:15,770 --> 00:53:16,840
Was it a day trip?

485
00:53:17,510 --> 00:53:18,670
Seo Woo...

486
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:22,880
What is it?

487
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:25,710
What is it? Why can't I be in the loop?

488
00:53:25,810 --> 00:53:28,780
You got over your trauma.

489
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:31,090
What trauma?

490
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:33,520
Hey. I want in too.

491
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:38,330
You rode a bike?

492
00:53:38,730 --> 00:53:40,330
You never even took it out after coming to Seoul.

493
00:53:40,330 --> 00:53:41,460
I even drove too.

494
00:53:42,030 --> 00:53:43,300
How far did you go?

495
00:53:43,530 --> 00:53:46,070
I drove for about five hours round trip.

496
00:53:46,070 --> 00:53:49,070
Why are you doing things you never did before?

497
00:53:49,070 --> 00:53:50,940
That's why you passed out and slept.

498
00:53:52,570 --> 00:53:54,610
You're becoming high maintenance.

499
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:17,800
You're hiding something, aren't you?

500
00:54:19,170 --> 00:54:20,300
Your wife...

501
00:54:21,270 --> 00:54:22,340
isn't coming.

502
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:26,170
You can't accept that.

503
00:54:27,370 --> 00:54:29,310
- You're half right. - I am?

504
00:54:30,610 --> 00:54:32,910
Then what is it that you can't accept?

505
00:54:33,180 --> 00:54:35,650
Tell me whether or not this is the absolute worst.

506
00:54:35,820 --> 00:54:37,350
That way, I can try to help.

507
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:38,890
The absolute worst...

508
00:54:40,190 --> 00:54:41,760
already happened.

509
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:47,130
How much does Seo Woo know?

510
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:07,580
Why won't he pick up?

511
00:55:07,780 --> 00:55:09,250
I have a bad feeling about this.

512
00:55:26,030 --> 00:55:27,200
Why didn't you come in?

513
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:31,110
- You look terrible. - I'm...

514
00:55:33,340 --> 00:55:34,780
just too anxious right now.

515
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:41,050
Can you try to take some deep breaths?

516
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:43,020
Take some deep breaths.

517
00:55:43,420 --> 00:55:45,050
There's someone I can't see.

518
00:55:47,420 --> 00:55:48,560
I want to avoid it.

519
00:55:49,820 --> 00:55:50,990
At the performance?

520
00:55:51,730 --> 00:55:53,360
Who? I'll get rid of them.

521
00:55:54,260 --> 00:55:56,300
You look like anxiety swallowed you up.

522
00:55:57,230 --> 00:55:58,400
Take deep breaths.

523
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,440
Come out. I'll hold you up.

524
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:05,710
Come out and try to stand.

525
00:56:05,910 --> 00:56:07,170
Put your feet on the ground.

526
00:56:07,780 --> 00:56:08,780
Come on.

527
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:15,720
Mr. Kang. Play with your eyes closed just for today.

528
00:56:16,180 --> 00:56:19,050
Play today, and quit the piano afterward.

529
00:56:19,590 --> 00:56:21,160
Your world won't fall apart even if you do.

530
00:56:24,490 --> 00:56:27,060
What you're afraid of won't happen.

531
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:52,550
Just a minute, please.

532
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:04,060
Don't stress about today's recording.

533
00:57:04,060 --> 00:57:06,830
Mr. Choi said not to feel pressured.

534
00:57:10,570 --> 00:57:12,710
You're okay, right?

535
00:57:20,170 --> 00:57:21,980
You're okay, right?

536
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:43,960
You're all set.

537
00:57:51,570 --> 00:57:53,810
Hey, we need to listen to this together.

538
00:57:54,270 --> 00:57:56,280
She found Kim Min Jung's point of reaction.

539
00:57:57,510 --> 00:57:58,550
Play it.

540
00:57:58,610 --> 00:58:00,550
Okay, I'm putting you on speaker.

541
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:05,350
It's Eunjoo Homestay. It was Eunjoo Homestay!

542
00:58:05,350 --> 00:58:06,550
Eunjoo Homestay?

543
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:08,520
Awesome.

544
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:10,920
I go to work at the hotel early in the morning,

545
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:12,830
eat a light lunch...

546
00:58:12,860 --> 00:58:16,360
or eat at a pretty restaurant and take a picture,

547
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:18,630
and post on my social media page around 1pm.

548
00:58:18,630 --> 00:58:22,370
I call my daughter as soon as my drama ends...

549
00:58:22,370 --> 00:58:24,570
and chat with her about it, then I go to bed.

550
00:58:24,570 --> 00:58:26,270
That's my daily life.

551
00:58:26,770 --> 00:58:29,710
How did you find the point of reaction? It's so random.

552
00:58:29,710 --> 00:58:31,610
I don't think it was random.

553
00:58:31,610 --> 00:58:33,750
It may be subjective, but it's connected...

554
00:58:33,750 --> 00:58:35,250
to a positive self-concept.

555
00:58:35,250 --> 00:58:37,550
- Positive... - It's purely personal,

556
00:58:37,550 --> 00:58:40,350
everyone has a memory that activates their will,

557
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:42,890
no, a memory that keeps them living.

558
00:58:42,890 --> 00:58:45,160
Something that motivates you.

559
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:46,660
Is it like the most beautiful moment in one's life?

560
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:48,500
No, it's different.

561
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:52,630
It's like the healthiest experience.

562
00:58:52,770 --> 00:58:54,600
A small piece of the person.

563
00:58:57,710 --> 00:58:58,740
(House Concert)

564
00:58:58,740 --> 00:59:00,540
It looks nice.

565
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:15,220
It's very different.

566
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:16,880
Isn't it good?

567
01:00:17,380 --> 01:00:19,590
I feel like he's back.

568
01:00:20,550 --> 01:00:22,620
Is he doing well?

569
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:39,670
I guess the person he can't see didn't come.

570
01:01:10,740 --> 01:01:12,240
I guess you're better.

571
01:01:12,740 --> 01:01:14,010
You're completely different.

572
01:01:15,010 --> 01:01:17,010
I feel extremely anxious,

573
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:19,810
but it's strange. It made something...

574
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:22,250
surface for some reason.

575
01:01:23,350 --> 01:01:26,990
Maybe your confidence and anxiety are alike.

576
01:01:27,720 --> 01:01:29,820
It was as good as your best performance.

577
01:01:30,790 --> 01:01:32,130
I don't know what I feel.

578
01:01:34,730 --> 01:01:37,130
Great job today.

579
01:01:37,130 --> 01:01:39,230
In Wook is buying dinner tonight.

580
01:01:39,570 --> 01:01:42,570
He looks like he had no clue.

581
01:01:43,140 --> 01:01:44,240
Yes, let's go.

582
01:01:45,170 --> 01:01:47,070
- What about Seo Woo? - Seo Woo!

583
01:01:47,980 --> 01:01:49,310
Why are you going without me?

584
01:01:52,610 --> 01:01:54,010
You should come with us.

585
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:57,720
But... I have a lot to put away. Go ahead. I'll meet you there.

586
01:01:57,720 --> 01:01:58,820
Please do...

587
01:01:59,220 --> 01:02:00,620
my recordings going forward.

588
01:02:03,490 --> 01:02:05,990
Are you officially hiring Seo Woo?

589
01:02:12,570 --> 01:02:14,800
I'll do my best.

590
01:02:15,340 --> 01:02:16,970
Great work everyone.

591
01:02:33,620 --> 01:02:34,960
Where did you sleep?

592
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:36,360
Where I chatted with it.

593
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:38,690
So that's the house.

594
01:02:38,730 --> 01:02:42,760
That house is perfect for you. It's quantum mechanics, you know?

595
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:46,130
It really comes down to the interactions.

596
01:02:46,130 --> 01:02:48,370
It meshes with you for some reason.

597
01:02:48,540 --> 01:02:51,770
Something in that house having a certain mass...

598
01:02:51,770 --> 01:02:53,640
It isn't an atom or a photon.

599
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:58,450
Whatever it is cuts through the air like this...

600
01:02:58,450 --> 01:03:01,380
and increases the electrical energy...

601
01:03:01,380 --> 01:03:03,920
in your nerve endings from zero...

602
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:06,250
to bring them to their maximum excited state.

603
01:03:06,250 --> 01:03:09,220
Sure. It's the perfect situation to make things up.

604
01:03:09,220 --> 01:03:12,060
"Something, somehow, for some reason..."

605
01:03:12,060 --> 01:03:13,430
Why are you walking so fast?

606
01:03:14,230 --> 01:03:15,600
Was I walking fast?

607
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:16,700
Yes.

608
01:03:17,130 --> 01:03:18,430
I have plans.

609
01:03:18,430 --> 01:03:19,670
What's the meeting about?

610
01:03:20,370 --> 01:03:23,370
It's just... It's not a meeting, but it kind of is.

611
01:03:23,370 --> 01:03:24,640
See you tomorrow.

612
01:03:27,870 --> 01:03:29,810
I see. "Just"?

613
01:03:30,780 --> 01:03:33,480
Why is he acting out of character?

614
01:04:14,420 --> 01:04:15,490
Oh my gosh.

615
01:04:17,860 --> 01:04:19,390
When did you come?

616
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:21,400
Just now.

617
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:24,000
But...

618
01:04:24,730 --> 01:04:27,170
Were you watching the whole time?

619
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:34,780
I thought I felt eyes on me.

620
01:04:42,450 --> 01:04:43,820
So this is how you look...

621
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:47,150
when you sleep well.

622
01:04:48,460 --> 01:04:51,290
You always looked very irritable.

623
01:04:51,590 --> 01:04:55,400
But... I'm getting a different vibe from you.

624
01:04:57,360 --> 01:04:59,130
I slept well for the first time in a while.

625
01:05:02,170 --> 01:05:03,400
This is how I feel.

626
01:05:06,610 --> 01:05:10,010
I analyzed why I slept so well all day long.

627
01:05:10,010 --> 01:05:12,550
You were tired. You drove and stuff.

628
01:05:13,780 --> 01:05:14,980
It's the house.

629
01:05:14,980 --> 01:05:17,080
That house is a good fit for you.

630
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:20,150
That house is perfect for you. It's quantum mechanics.

631
01:05:20,250 --> 01:05:22,490
Please, anything but quantum mechanics.

632
01:05:22,490 --> 01:05:23,960
Like frequencies.

633
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:27,030
Looking at quantum mechanics, it's mutual interaction.

634
01:05:27,030 --> 01:05:29,530
Your special frequencies matched.

635
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:32,300
It went from here to there.

636
01:05:32,770 --> 01:05:35,500
The special frequencies within that house...

637
01:05:35,500 --> 01:05:36,940
were picked up by you.

638
01:05:37,040 --> 01:05:39,270
Something somehow...

639
01:05:39,270 --> 01:05:40,310
That's why...

640
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:42,640
you could feel me behind you.

641
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:44,850
Exactly. The house is the reason.

642
01:05:46,810 --> 01:05:47,850
You're astute.

643
01:05:48,450 --> 01:05:51,750
So there's something in the house that helps me sleep.

644
01:05:52,620 --> 01:05:53,820
That certain something.

645
01:05:55,420 --> 01:05:56,620
I should sleep there from now on.

646
01:05:57,490 --> 01:05:59,960
Nice.

647
01:06:01,530 --> 01:06:02,830
Did you sleep well?

648
01:06:03,430 --> 01:06:05,500
I did. I slept like a log.

649
01:06:06,770 --> 01:06:08,370
I think I know why.

650
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:11,940
You know how new blankets are all crinkly.

651
01:06:11,940 --> 01:06:13,210
And they feel nice.

652
01:06:13,610 --> 01:06:15,210
I fell right asleep.

653
01:06:18,350 --> 01:06:19,780
- The blanket. - I'm positive.

654
01:06:22,820 --> 01:06:24,220
I didn't get to see you sleep.

655
01:06:25,020 --> 01:06:26,920
- Next time? - Sleep with me again next time.

656
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:35,530
I mean...

657
01:06:36,730 --> 01:06:39,330
Is "Sleep with me" the right way to say it?

658
01:07:03,290 --> 01:07:05,890
Everyone's there, so I have to go.

659
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,130
Are you going to the house?

660
01:07:12,370 --> 01:07:15,040
I want to see if it really is the location.

661
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:17,640
I see.

662
01:07:19,470 --> 01:07:20,940
You see what?

663
01:07:23,840 --> 01:07:25,310
Why are you so awkward?

664
01:07:32,450 --> 01:07:33,690
When I was coming here...

665
01:07:35,060 --> 01:07:36,560
It's not like we made plans,

666
01:07:38,630 --> 01:07:39,690
but I hoped...

667
01:07:40,860 --> 01:07:42,200
you'd be here.

668
01:07:43,130 --> 01:07:46,730
It was a very unfamiliar feeling, but it felt warm.

669
01:07:56,540 --> 01:07:57,610
That sounds...

670
01:07:59,110 --> 01:08:00,150
really nice.

671
01:08:05,190 --> 01:08:07,050
(Mr. Kang In Wook)

672
01:08:07,620 --> 01:08:09,960
I think he's calling to tell me to hurry up.

673
01:08:10,290 --> 01:08:11,290
Excuse me.

674
01:08:14,090 --> 01:08:15,130
Hello.

675
01:08:15,530 --> 01:08:17,000
I'd like to listen...

676
01:08:18,630 --> 01:08:20,200
to my performance at the studio.

677
01:08:21,900 --> 01:08:22,900
Right now?

678
01:08:23,970 --> 01:08:25,670
I left the studio.

679
01:08:27,670 --> 01:08:28,710
This is...

680
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:31,980
very unusual for me.

681
01:08:34,550 --> 01:08:36,220
The food is good here.

682
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:37,480
Let's drink until late...

683
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:39,950
and work in the afternoon tomorrow.

684
01:08:39,950 --> 01:08:41,960
- Yes, sir. - Eat up.

685
01:08:42,620 --> 01:08:43,790
It'll take 10 minutes.

686
01:08:45,060 --> 01:08:46,960
It wasn't an important performance,

687
01:08:49,730 --> 01:08:51,030
but it's meaningful to me.

688
01:08:54,370 --> 01:08:56,700
Will 10 minutes really do?

689
01:08:59,440 --> 01:09:00,470
Okay.

690
01:09:05,580 --> 01:09:09,350
Mr. Kang In Wook had been in a slump all this time,

691
01:09:09,350 --> 01:09:11,450
and did really well today.

692
01:09:12,590 --> 01:09:14,190
He wants to listen to the recording.

693
01:09:15,190 --> 01:09:16,290
I'll wait.

694
01:09:29,640 --> 01:09:30,670
Kang In Wook.

695
01:09:47,750 --> 01:09:49,160
It's definitely different.

696
01:09:53,660 --> 01:09:54,830
Tension.

697
01:09:55,560 --> 01:09:58,130
There's a tension that anxiety creates.

698
01:09:59,870 --> 01:10:02,700
Anxiety created by a person I really don't want to see.

699
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:07,440
Did you see the person earlier at the recital?

700
01:10:12,410 --> 01:10:13,950
No. I thought the person was there, but I was wrong.

701
01:10:14,810 --> 01:10:16,720
You were anxious thinking the person was there.

702
01:10:18,390 --> 01:10:19,650
I see.

703
01:10:24,290 --> 01:10:25,330
Let me try to play.

704
01:10:27,460 --> 01:10:29,500
You want to play right now?

705
01:11:11,170 --> 01:11:12,410
I'll be done soon.

706
01:11:12,940 --> 01:11:14,240
Is he playing right now?

707
01:11:14,840 --> 01:11:16,440
I think he felt inspired.

708
01:11:35,560 --> 01:11:36,860
Sorry.

709
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:38,970
We can listen together.

710
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:11,490
I'll text often.

711
01:13:13,090 --> 01:13:15,900
You said that made you feel like I was with you.

712
01:13:19,270 --> 01:13:22,770
I am helping, aren't I?

713
01:13:26,310 --> 01:13:29,910
I'm helping you, but I feel like I'm the one receiving help.

714
01:13:30,910 --> 01:13:32,610
Giving feels like receiving,

715
01:13:33,450 --> 01:13:34,910
and receiving feels like giving.

716
01:13:36,620 --> 01:13:38,550
Isn't that what it means to be together?

717
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:42,290
You are...

718
01:13:43,390 --> 01:13:45,020
of great help.

719
01:13:46,630 --> 01:13:47,660
I'm glad.

720
01:13:52,500 --> 01:13:55,200
The more I think about it, the more I like the phrase...

721
01:13:55,570 --> 01:13:57,440
"being in the air".

722
01:13:58,300 --> 01:14:00,640
Staying by your side comfortably like air.

723
01:14:00,910 --> 01:14:02,140
How nice is that?

724
01:14:02,510 --> 01:14:04,840
Unintrusive like flowing water.

725
01:14:06,210 --> 01:14:08,210
It's nice feeling like someone is by your side.

726
01:14:08,920 --> 01:14:10,780
It provides a sense of security.

727
01:14:13,050 --> 01:14:16,260
I can stay as much as you want.

728
01:14:18,890 --> 01:14:20,460
It's not like anyone can do it.

729
01:14:21,090 --> 01:14:22,600
It's only because it's me.

730
01:14:23,230 --> 01:14:24,730
Why can you do it?

731
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:30,200
Because you are such and such a person,

732
01:14:30,440 --> 01:14:34,310
and I am such and such a person. I think that's why it's possible.

733
01:14:34,570 --> 01:14:36,580
That "such and such" is for you to fill in,

734
01:14:38,580 --> 01:14:40,310
but it's like we share...

735
01:14:40,310 --> 01:14:43,220
the one thing we wish others would understand.

736
01:14:49,720 --> 01:14:50,920
I'll do it too.

737
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:55,060
I'll be the person who stays...

738
01:14:57,330 --> 01:14:58,430
for you.

739
01:15:18,180 --> 01:15:21,220
(Epilogue)

740
01:16:51,080 --> 01:16:53,480
(A Piece of Your Mind)

741
01:16:53,810 --> 01:16:54,810
Your hand.

742
01:16:55,210 --> 01:16:57,380
Briefly and affectionately.

743
01:16:57,380 --> 01:17:01,350
How does it feel to be in the studio with Kang In Wook all day long?

744
01:17:01,350 --> 01:17:03,060
Eun Joo and her boyfriend broke up.

745
01:17:03,190 --> 01:17:04,260
Get out.

746
01:17:04,260 --> 01:17:05,360
Oh my gosh.

747
01:17:06,160 --> 01:17:07,660
You're leaving anyway.

748
01:17:07,660 --> 01:17:08,760
I want to settle down here.

749
01:17:08,760 --> 01:17:09,760
Out of the blue?

750
01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:12,300
Did my 1 percent grow to 20 percent?

751
01:17:12,630 --> 01:17:14,400
Someone's hand that I want to hold.

752
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:16,400
Isn't it really nice...

753
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:17,600
to hold their hand?

754
01:17:20,210 --> 01:17:21,570
Close your eyes.
