<b>I'm already going through enough. Let's talk about it next time.</b>

<b>I think I'm more than qualified.</b>

<b>I really worked hard, sir.</b>

225

<b>I know you worked hard.</b>

226
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:53,540
<b>Then you should give me a chance.</b>

<b>I'd love to give you a chance.</b>

<b>But you're still single.</b>

229

<b>- What? - Why are you so ambitious...</b>

230

<b>when you don't even have a family to feed?</b>

<b>- Dr. Kim is single, too. - My gosh, come on.</b>

<b>Men and women are different.</b>

<b>So it's okay for a guy but not okay for a woman to be ambitious?</b>

<b>I'm not being greedy. I'm just trying to survive.</b>

<b>Dr. Sul, listen to me.</b>

236

<b>The hospital is already in a mess because of Dr. Ji.</b>

<b>I don't need you to add onto that.</b>

238

<b>I'm not very happy...</b>

<b>with how you're behaving right now.</b>

<b>You're acting as if you only care about yourself.</b>

<b>Women always cause so many problems. My goodness.</b>

242

<b>You're right. I'm a woman.</b>

<b>And I'm single.</b>

244
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:53,570
<b>But I worked just as hard as the others, if not more.</b>

245
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,570
<b>Because I don't have any children whom I can rely on after I retire,</b>

246
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,510
<b>and I don't have a husband to protect me.</b>

247
00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:00,470
<b>And I can't believe you're treating Sun Woo like this.</b>

<b>You already demoted her so you could get that donation.</b>

249
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:07,150
<b>But now, you're even treating her like a nuisance?</b>

250
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:09,650
<b>Why? Do you think she's some kind of a criminal...</b>

251
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:11,220
<b>because a detective came by to see her?</b>

252
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:13,820
<b>No, I never called her a criminal.</b>

253

<b>Every time something happened at the hospital,</b>

254

<b>she stepped up on your behalf and took care of everything.</b>

255
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:20,460
<b>But now, you think she's just a troublemaker?</b>

256
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:22,000
<b>Why?</b>

257
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:25,430
<b>- Is it because she's single? - Dr. Sul!</b>

258

<b>- Why are you overreacting today? - Then tell me...</b>

<b>why you think women are troublemakers...</b>

260

316
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,470
<b>Not everyone who is questioned is guilty.</b>

317
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:13,780
<b>He may have been Joon Young's mom's patient.</b>

318
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:16,510
<b>Sometimes they ask for details when investigating a case.</b>

319
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:23,990
<b>Running your mouth without knowing the details...</b>

320
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:26,190
<b>is extremely ignorant.</b>

321
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:40,240
<b>I'm right. They are dating.</b>

322
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:42,770
<b>They're definitely dating.</b>

323
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:44,410
<b>Where are you going?</b>

324
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:47,140
<b>(Mom)</b>

325
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,630
<b>Joon Young.</b>

326
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:17,940
<b>What was...</b>

327
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:21,380
<b>Dr. Ji's relationship with the man that died?</b>

328
00:33:27,050 --> 00:33:30,890
<b>A divorcee and a younger man. Isn't it obvious?</b>

329
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:34,020
<b>Oh my gosh.</b>

330
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:37,190
<b>Isn't what obvious?</b>

331
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:40,130
<b>I don't want to say it out loud.</b>

332
00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:43,700
<b>The Gosan mommy groups are going crazy.</b>

333
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:48,300
<b>Don't tell me you believe such a groundless rumor.</b>

334
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:50,970
<b>Why is it groundless?</b>

335
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:55,550
<b>Dr. Ji's item was found at the scene.</b>

336
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:56,550
<b>Really?</b>

337
00:33:57,910 --> 00:33:59,420
<b>Did Ji Sun Woo kill him then?</b>

338
00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:02,420
<b>How do you know that?</b>

339
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:04,820
<b>My husband looked into it.</b>

340
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:10,190
<b>Unfortunately, our son Hae Kang is close with her son.</b>

341
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:12,930
<b>So we have to stay informed.</b>

342
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:16,230
<b>Ye Rim, you don't have kids, so you don't understand how we feel.</b>

343
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:21,440
<b>Politicians must be careful...</b>

344
00:34:22,410 --> 00:34:24,370
<b>of malicious gossip above all else.</b>

345
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:29,810
<b>A politician's wife shouldn't go around speaking so carelessly.</b>

346
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:34,620
<b>I don't say a peep elsewhere.</b>

347
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:37,820
<b>It's because I trust everyone in our association.</b>

348
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:42,560
<b>Of course. We should know.</b>

349
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:45,800
<b>Everyone here is involved with Ji Sun Woo one way or another.</b>

350
00:34:46,430 --> 00:34:48,730
<b>Furthermore, she's a member.</b>

351
00:34:48,730 --> 00:34:49,970
<b>That's right.</b>

352
00:34:49,970 --> 00:34:52,970
<b>If we can't exchange information during such an important time,</b>

353
00:34:53,970 --> 00:34:56,270
<b>the association would be meaningless.</b>

354
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,910
<b>"Exchange information"? What a euphemism.</b>

355
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,080
<b>In reality, it's just hearsay.</b>

356
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:05,150
<b>What's with you today?</b>

357
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:07,220
<b>You keep crossing the line.</b>

358
00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:09,620
<b>Oh dear. Is that how you took it?</b>

359
00:35:10,690 --> 00:35:13,220
<b>Shouldn't you head back to the hospital, Dr. Sul?</b>

360
00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:17,290
<b>I set the hours during which I see my patients, ma'am.</b>

361
00:35:18,130 --> 00:35:20,160
<b>I'm high enough to do that.</b>

362
00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:26,400
<b>I have something to tell you.</b>

363
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,970
<b>I'm going to court tomorrow.</b>

364
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:33,110
<b>My divorce will be finalized a month later.</b>

365
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:34,940
<b>Really?</b>

366
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:38,150
<b>You should've just scared him and ended it at that.</b>

367
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:40,620
<b>You don't even have kids. You'll be all alone.</b>

368
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,890
<b>I'm sure he learned his lesson.</b>

369
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,720
<b>Give in and take him back.</b>

370
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:47,120
<b>It's not an act to scare him.</b>

371
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:48,830
<b>I'm really...</b>

372
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:52,090
<b>getting divorced.</b>

373
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:55,830
<b>If you ask why I'm getting divorced,</b>

374
00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:57,700
<b>I'll tell you whenever you want.</b>

375
00:35:58,230 --> 00:35:59,970
<b>So please don't ignite your imagination.</b>

376
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:01,940
<b>Okay, then.</b>

377
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:05,510
<b>I'll bow out now.</b>

378
00:36:07,210 --> 00:36:08,610
<b>You can talk about me freely.</b>

379
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,460
<b>I'll find out...</b>

380
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:22,290
<b>what happened.</b>

381
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:33,870
<b>I guess this group is almost finished too.</b>

382
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:39,740
<b>Ye Rim!</b>

383
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:45,550
<b>If you're trying to stop me, don't bother.</b>

384
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:48,250
<b>Why would I stop you? That was so cathartic.</b>

385
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:50,220
<b>You did great.</b>

386
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,620
<b>Let's go for a drink.</b>

387
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,940
<b>How are things with Mom?</b>

388
00:37:15,310 --> 00:37:16,680
<b>Did she go to work today?</b>

389
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:18,780
<b>Of course, she did.</b>

390
00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:21,480
<b>What time did she get home last night?</b>

391
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:23,190
<b>Was she home very late?</b>

392
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:25,560
<b>Why do you keep asking?</b>

393
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:28,690
<b>Of course, I should ask.</b>

394
00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:32,730
<b>I need to know whether or not she's doing a good job raising you.</b>

395
00:37:37,930 --> 00:37:39,000
<b>What's wrong?</b>

396
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:45,370
<b>Joon Young.</b>

397
00:37:45,370 --> 00:37:46,910
<b>Why did you get divorced then?</b>

398
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,610
<b>Why did you come back?</b>

399
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:51,710
<b>You're the problem.</b>

400
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:53,750
<b>You're the one who cheated and left us.</b>

401
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:55,520
<b>You're the one who got married as you pleased.</b>

402
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,220
<b>You're the one who was wrong.</b>

403
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:01,090
<b>Take care of your problems on your own.</b>

404
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:03,790
<b>Stop annoying me.</b>

405
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:33,220
<b>(Kim Yoon Ki)</b>

406
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:41,460
<b>The person you have reached is not available.</b>

407
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:43,870
<b>Please leave a message after the tone.</b>

408
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,020
<b>What's the matter with you?</b>

409
00:40:16,430 --> 00:40:17,830
<b>We've met before, haven't we?</b>

410
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:21,360
<b>I think I saw you with Chairman Yeo a few times.</b>

411
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:23,200
<b>What are you trying to do?</b>

412
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:25,500
<b>Why are you tailing Ji Sun Woo?</b>

413
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,540
<b>I have no idea what you're talking about.</b>

414
00:40:30,410 --> 00:40:32,210
<b>This is getting interesting.</b>

415
00:40:34,610 --> 00:40:37,880
<b>Is that incident related to Chairman Yeo?</b>

416
00:40:40,650 --> 00:40:43,020
<b>(Wild Rabbit)</b>

417
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:55,770
<b>In Kyu called Lee Tae Oh...</b>

418
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,970
<b>and demanded him to bring money.</b>

419
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:12,380
<b>Where's Park In Kyu?</b>

420
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:16,820
<b>I'm going to kill him, so hurry up and tell me where he is!</b>

421
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:18,990
<b>Let go of me!</b>

422
00:41:21,990 --> 00:41:23,230
<b>I was so scared.</b>

423
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,360
<b>That's why I told him...</b>

424
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:29,670
<b>In Kyu's on the rooftop.</b>

425
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:50,120
<b>I never imagined...</b>

426
00:41:51,650 --> 00:41:53,260
<b>such a thing would happen.</b>

427
00:42:02,830 --> 00:42:04,370
<b>It was him.</b>

428
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:08,770
<b>But you didn't see it with your own eyes.</b>

429
00:42:10,770 --> 00:42:13,340
<b>He's the one who killed In Kyu.</b>

430
00:42:16,210 --> 00:42:19,050
<b>But will people believe you?</b>

431
00:42:23,450 --> 00:42:24,690
<b>I know.</b>

432
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:29,430
<b>I have no money or connections, so who'd believe me?</b>

433
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:32,260
<b>That's why I ran away.</b>

434
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:35,030
<b>I ran like a coward.</b>

435
00:42:44,710 --> 00:42:46,740
<b>The police must be looking for me too.</b>

436
00:42:48,410 --> 00:42:50,610
<b>If they find out I was with him until the last moment,</b>

437
00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:52,750
<b>what'll happen to me?</b>

438
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:56,650
<b>You'd be at a disadvantage...</b>

439
00:42:58,290 --> 00:42:59,620
<b>since you had a fight with him.</b>

440
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:01,820
<b>It wasn't me.</b>

441
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:04,960
<b>It was Lee Tae Oh.</b>

442
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:09,270
<b>Tae Oh has Chairman Yeo behind his back.</b>

443
00:43:10,830 --> 00:43:12,330
<b>He'll try to stop Tae Oh...</b>

<b>from getting charged at least for his daughter.</b>

445

<b>It'd be best not to take any rash actions.</b>

446
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:46,770
<b>People won't believe me,</b>

447
00:43:47,670 --> 00:43:49,540
<b>but they'll believe you.</b>

448
00:43:52,070 --> 00:43:53,480
<b>I want you to hold onto it.</b>

449

<b>You're...</b>

<b>the only person...</b>

<b>I can trust now.</b>

<b>You'll help me, right?</b>

<b>Until I call you,</b>

<b>stay here and don't let anyone see you.</b>

455

<b>You trust me, don't you?</b>

456
00:45:26,670 --> 00:45:27,770
<b>What is it?</b>

457
00:45:29,870 --> 00:45:31,270
<b>I had dinner with Joon Young.</b>

458
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:35,140
<b>Why did you come home so late?</b>

459
00:45:38,910 --> 00:45:41,980
<b>I was contacted by the police to come in for questioning.</b>

460
00:45:44,250 --> 00:45:45,820
<b>They already came to see me and left.</b>

461
00:45:47,260 --> 00:45:48,720
<b>You were at Gosan Station yesterday, weren't you?</b>

462
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:51,660
<b>I saw you there.</b>

463
00:46:10,810 --> 00:46:11,880
<b>Why?</b>

464
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:14,780
<b>Are you trying...</b>

465
00:46:16,150 --> 00:46:19,050
<b>- to frame me as a murderer now? - Watch what you say.</b>

466
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:22,790
<b>- You're Joon Young's mother. - Yes.</b>

467
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:27,530
<b>I'm glad you said that.</b>

468
00:46:30,070 --> 00:46:32,700
<b>I'm Joon Young's mom, and you're Joon Young's dad.</b>

469
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:36,040
<b>So be honest with me.</b>

470
00:46:40,180 --> 00:46:41,280
<b>Park In Kyu...</b>

471
00:46:44,610 --> 00:46:45,850
<b>Was it your doing?</b>

472
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:53,060
<b>Someone saw you go to the rooftop.</b>

473
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:54,160
<b>Who says?</b>

474
00:46:56,090 --> 00:46:57,160
<b>Don't tell me...</b>

475
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:00,700
<b>Min Hyun Seo said that.</b>

476
00:47:02,730 --> 00:47:05,330
<b>Are you two working together to frame me?</b>

477
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:07,140
<b>Why would I do that?</b>

478
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:09,200
<b>Because you did it. You killed Park In Kyu.</b>

479
00:47:09,570 --> 00:47:10,640
<b>Am I wrong?</b>

480
00:47:11,810 --> 00:47:14,910
<b>It was you who went up to the rooftop after scaring Hyun Seo.</b>

481
00:47:14,910 --> 00:47:16,810
<b>After that, Park In Kyu fell down.</b>

482
00:47:18,910 --> 00:47:21,820
<b>He was already on the ground when I went up there.</b>

483
00:47:23,290 --> 00:47:24,550
<b>It has to be one or the other.</b>

484
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:27,660
<b>Either Min Hyun Seo killed him,</b>

485
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:30,330
<b>or you killed him with her.</b>

486
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:31,990
<b>Do you think...</b>

487
00:47:34,330 --> 00:47:35,830
<b>that makes any sense?</b>

488
00:47:35,830 --> 00:47:37,030
<b>- Are you telling me I'm wrong? - You're wrong.</b>

489
00:47:37,030 --> 00:47:38,500
<b>Can you swear it on Joon Young's name?</b>

490
00:47:38,830 --> 00:47:40,540
<b>Don't get him involved in this.</b>

491
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,670
<b>I didn't do anything wrong enough to deserve this.</b>

492
00:47:42,670 --> 00:47:44,870
<b>It wasn't me either. It's true I went there furious,</b>

493
00:47:45,770 --> 00:47:47,380
<b>but I wasn't the one who did it. Okay?</b>

494
00:47:50,580 --> 00:47:51,650
<b>Fine.</b>

495
00:47:53,250 --> 00:47:55,420
<b>Neither of us did it. Right?</b>

496
00:47:56,190 --> 00:47:57,420
<b>It must be Min Hyun Seo, then.</b>

497
00:47:58,950 --> 00:48:01,190
<b>Let's just say she did it.</b>

498
00:48:01,490 --> 00:48:02,820
<b>Are you crazy?</b>

499
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:06,530
<b>Are you sacrificing that poor girl so you can get out of it?</b>

500
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:09,360
<b>Are you trying to frame her as a murderer?</b>

501
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:11,530
<b>I'm saying this so both of us can get out of it.</b>

502
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:12,970
<b>Don't you get it?</b>

503
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:30,650
<b>Hey, Lee Tae Oh.</b>

504
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:36,530
<b>- Thank you. - Bye.</b>

505
00:48:36,790 --> 00:48:37,860
<b>You.</b>

506
00:48:38,630 --> 00:48:41,260
<b>I'm glad I ran into you.</b>

507
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:44,070
<b>Just think about what would be the best for Joon Young.</b>

508
00:48:44,530 --> 00:48:45,630
<b>All right?</b>

509
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:47,400
<b>You...</b>

510
00:48:48,470 --> 00:48:52,240
<b>promised to give me the associate director position.</b>

511
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:58,150
<b>Hey, be careful. You'll fall.</b>

512
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:02,920
<b>Jerk.</b>

513
00:49:04,150 --> 00:49:06,990
<b>You jerk, come back here.</b>

514
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:12,930
<b>You're so cute.</b>

515
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:16,730
<b>- Myung Sook. - He's a jerk.</b>

516
00:49:17,570 --> 00:49:19,770
<b>Hey, you.</b>

517
00:49:21,470 --> 00:49:23,270
<b>Why is he here?</b>

518
00:49:24,070 --> 00:49:26,010
<b>Did he come here to get on your nerves again?</b>

519
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,510
<b>He just came to see Joon Young.</b>

520
00:49:29,510 --> 00:49:30,880
<b>We're going to have another round of drinks.</b>

521
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:33,220
<b>Do you want to join?</b>

522
00:49:35,580 --> 00:49:38,290
<b>I have to talk to my friends about something.</b>

523
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:40,860
<b>Okay.</b>

524
00:49:44,290 --> 00:49:45,430
<b>Do you have a lot of homework?</b>

525
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:47,860
<b>Should I make you some snacks?</b>

526
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:49,460
<b>I don't need it.</b>

527
00:49:51,230 --> 00:49:53,940
<b>Did you have a nice dinner with Dad?</b>

528
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:57,370
<b>Yes.</b>

529
00:49:59,610 --> 00:50:00,940
<b>Go to bed early if you're tired.</b>

530
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:03,850
<b>Don't worry. I'll figure it out.</b>

531
00:50:04,850 --> 00:50:07,750
<b>Okay. I'm hanging up.</b>

532
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:17,990
<b>Hey.</b>

533
00:50:18,530 --> 00:50:21,330
<b>He's in the eighth grade. Just let him be.</b>

534
00:50:21,530 --> 00:50:24,830
<b>It's useless to worry about him. He'll just think you're nagging.</b>

535
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,640
<b>She's right, Sun Woo. Come here and have a drink.</b>

536
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:30,170
<b>Where did you guys get so drunk?</b>

537
00:50:30,670 --> 00:50:31,840
<b>Did something good happen?</b>

538
00:50:32,910 --> 00:50:34,980
<b>We're no longer part of the women's association anymore.</b>

539
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:36,350
<b>So we had a few drinks to celebrate.</b>

540
00:50:38,150 --> 00:50:39,180
<b>What did you just say?</b>

541
00:50:39,180 --> 00:50:41,950
<b>She's going to get a divorce.</b>

542
00:50:43,620 --> 00:50:45,290
<b>We both signed the papers.</b>

543
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:47,160
<b>And we're going to the courthouse tomorrow.</b>

544
00:50:47,690 --> 00:50:49,560
<b>Our marriage will finally be over in a month.</b>

545
00:50:54,630 --> 00:50:58,300
<b>Don't look at me like that. I'm really happy right now.</b>

546
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:08,910
<b>Why are you crying?</b>

547
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:11,250
<b>Even Sun Woo is trying hard to hang in there.</b>

548
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:23,730
<b>I'm surprised by how easy it is.</b>

549
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:26,130
<b>It's so futile.</b>

550
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:31,930
<b>All I needed to do was sign a piece of paper.</b>

551
00:51:34,970 --> 00:51:36,470
<b>I wonder why...</b>

552
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:41,080
<b>I gave myself such a hard time by trying to protect this marriage.</b>

553
00:51:44,110 --> 00:51:45,610
<b>Is marriage...</b>

554
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:49,920
<b>this meaningless?</b>

555
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:52,250
<b>I mean,</b>

556
00:51:53,290 --> 00:51:54,690
<b>there's nothing left.</b>

557
00:51:54,690 --> 00:51:57,290
<b>My marriage is over, and I'm totally empty-handed.</b>

558
00:52:00,430 --> 00:52:01,660
<b>Does it mean nothing...</b>

559
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:04,200
<b>to be married?</b>

560
00:52:07,170 --> 00:52:09,340
<b>How great would it be if you could get over someone that easily?</b>

561
00:52:11,270 --> 00:52:12,840
<b>You'd better brace yourself.</b>

562
00:52:14,210 --> 00:52:16,480
<b>Ending your relationship won't be as easy as you think.</b>

563
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:18,810
<b>At least that's how it was with me.</b>

564
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:23,220
<b>Whatever the case,</b>

565
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:28,720
<b>I'm so happy that you guys are single now.</b>

566
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:30,360
<b>You.</b>

567
00:52:32,830 --> 00:52:34,000
<b>Stop crying.</b>

568
00:52:35,630 --> 00:52:36,670
<b>And you.</b>

569
00:52:37,770 --> 00:52:39,100
<b>Don't lose your fight.</b>

570
00:52:40,170 --> 00:52:41,200
<b>And as for me...</b>

571
00:52:45,170 --> 00:52:47,710
<b>I'll continue to be cool.</b>

572
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:52,550
<b>Okay?</b>

573
00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:05,690
<b>Sun Woo.</b>

574
00:53:06,830 --> 00:53:07,900
<b>Be careful.</b>

575
00:53:09,130 --> 00:53:10,970
<b>People think you're the one...</b>

576
00:53:12,030 --> 00:53:13,940
<b>who killed that guy at Gosan Station.</b>

577
00:53:18,910 --> 00:53:19,910
<b>Really?</b>

578
00:53:24,110 --> 00:53:26,850
<b>You know what? Just forget it.</b>

579
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:31,250
<b>When did you ever care about what other people think?</b>

580
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:34,160
<b>Listen.</b>

581
00:53:35,990 --> 00:53:38,230
<b>Pretend like you didn't do it even if you did.</b>

582
00:53:39,930 --> 00:53:42,530
<b>And you should become the associate director again.</b>

583
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:45,230
<b>Just get what you want and be a queen.</b>

584
00:53:46,230 --> 00:53:47,270
<b>Okay?</b>

585
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:49,440
<b>Cheers.</b>

586
00:53:50,970 --> 00:53:52,040
<b>Cheers.</b>

587
00:53:54,380 --> 00:53:55,440
<b>We're the best.</b>

588
00:54:07,490 --> 00:54:09,320
<b>Why are you still up? It's late.</b>

589
00:54:19,570 --> 00:54:21,300
<b>Did you know the guy...</b>

590
00:54:24,370 --> 00:54:26,140
<b>that died at Gosan Station?</b>

591
00:54:28,540 --> 00:54:31,350
<b>- Who told you that? - I heard a cop went to see you.</b>

592
00:54:32,950 --> 00:54:34,180
<b>My friends told me at school.</b>

593
00:54:36,350 --> 00:54:37,850
<b>He was my patient.</b>

594
00:54:38,820 --> 00:54:40,760
<b>That's why a cop came to see me.</b>

595
00:54:42,390 --> 00:54:43,630
<b>You didn't kill him.</b>

596
00:54:45,330 --> 00:54:46,360
<b>Right?</b>

597
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:50,800
<b>Of course not.</b>

598
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:53,300
<b>My gosh.</b>

599
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:55,170
<b>Then why are people suspicious of you?</b>

600
00:54:58,410 --> 00:55:00,010
<b>They're just bored.</b>

601
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:03,710
<b>They're just people who enjoy talking behind people's backs.</b>

602
00:55:05,950 --> 00:55:07,950
<b>I'm sure you also have a few friends like that.</b>

603
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:10,050
<b>It's mostly about the same person though.</b>

604
00:55:12,250 --> 00:55:13,890
<b>Why can't you live a comfortable life?</b>

605
00:55:14,490 --> 00:55:16,630
<b>Why can't you be normal like the other moms?</b>

606
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:21,200
<b>And what about me? Why do I need to live like this?</b>

607
00:55:22,430 --> 00:55:24,230
<b>I didn't even do anything wrong.</b>

608
00:55:25,570 --> 00:55:27,500
<b>I never told you to get a divorce.</b>

609
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:29,540
<b>And I never told Dad to marry another woman.</b>

610
00:55:32,210 --> 00:55:34,010
<b>I never wanted any of that.</b>

611
00:55:50,290 --> 00:55:51,960
<b>This is all on me and your dad.</b>

612
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:23,190
<b>Nice.</b>

613
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:25,890
<b>Nice. It's a hazard.</b>

614
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:30,100
<b>It feels as if you're starting from zero again.</b>

615
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:33,870
<b>I didn't get to practice a lot because of Jenny.</b>

616
00:56:34,670 --> 00:56:37,110
<b>I'm going to bother you to play once the weather gets nicer.</b>

617
00:56:37,110 --> 00:56:38,510
<b>I'd love that.</b>

618
00:56:38,970 --> 00:56:40,540
<b>You'd better keep your word.</b>

619
00:56:45,150 --> 00:56:47,950
<b>Is everything okay with Tae Oh?</b>

620
00:56:52,490 --> 00:56:54,520
<b>Every time you ask me that,</b>

621
00:56:55,390 --> 00:56:57,290
<b>it makes me feel like I'm waiting to get graded.</b>

622
00:56:58,890 --> 00:56:59,930
<b>Really?</b>

623
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:01,830
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

624
00:57:03,430 --> 00:57:05,130
<b>Things can't always be great.</b>

625
00:57:08,540 --> 00:57:11,910
<b>I finally learned that after I got married.</b>

626
00:57:13,510 --> 00:57:15,010
<b>I didn't know that before.</b>

627
00:57:18,010 --> 00:57:20,950
<b>You can break up with him whenever you want.</b>

628
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:25,790
<b>I'll take care of you and Jenny.</b>

629
00:57:29,190 --> 00:57:30,690
<b>I know...</b>

630
00:57:32,630 --> 00:57:34,260
<b>you still don't like Tae Oh.</b>

631
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:36,060
<b>I know that.</b>

632
00:57:38,030 --> 00:57:40,400
<b>I want to take responsibility for the choice I made.</b>

633
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:44,470
<b>I don't want to give you and Mom a hard time because of my marriage.</b>

634
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:50,510
<b>A dad means everything to a daughter.</b>

635
00:57:52,250 --> 00:57:54,250
<b>And Jenny should have a dad.</b>

636
00:57:56,620 --> 00:57:58,420
<b>You get what I mean, right?</b>

637
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:03,060
<b>No, I don't.</b>

638
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:12,130
<b>Let's just play nine holes today.</b>

639
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:13,770
<b>Why? Is it not fun?</b>

640
00:58:14,140 --> 00:58:16,810
<b>I want to go home early so I can eat with Tae Oh.</b>

641
00:58:59,850 --> 00:59:00,920
<b>Oh, gosh.</b>

642
00:59:06,750 --> 00:59:08,590
<b>- What time is it? - Are you crazy?</b>

643
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:10,760
<b>Why did you sleep here?</b>

644
00:59:13,830 --> 00:59:16,500
<b>I must've told the driver the wrong address.</b>

645
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:23,240
<b>I'm craving your homemade hangover soup.</b>

646
00:59:24,540 --> 00:59:25,570
<b>Please?</b>

647
00:59:31,650 --> 00:59:33,650
<b>I'm so happy about the fact that I don't have to cook.</b>

648
00:59:34,380 --> 00:59:36,180
<b>Stop talking nonsense and just drink water.</b>

649
00:59:37,490 --> 00:59:39,190
<b>I don't know if it's because I slept here.</b>

650
00:59:41,590 --> 00:59:42,890
<b>But I slept really well last night.</b>

651
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:51,830
<b>- Shouldn't you go to work? - I should.</b>

652
00:59:55,170 --> 00:59:57,540
<b>But I need to drop by Sun Woo's office first.</b>

653
01:00:00,170 --> 01:00:01,240
<b>Why?</b>

654
01:00:04,150 --> 01:00:06,410
<b>One of my school friends is a cop.</b>

655
01:00:07,250 --> 01:00:09,280
<b>This isn't his jurisdiction. He works somewhere else.</b>

656
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:10,290
<b>Anyway,</b>

657
01:00:11,050 --> 01:00:13,960
<b>I drank with him until late last night and found out some stuff.</b>

658
01:00:16,190 --> 01:00:18,260
<b>This is very strange.</b>

659
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:20,260
<b>Strange? How?</b>

660
01:00:23,430 --> 01:00:25,870
<b>Gosan Station has cameras all over the place.</b>

661
01:00:26,630 --> 01:00:30,240
<b>But the server was being inspected that day, so they have no footage.</b>

662
01:00:31,070 --> 01:00:34,140
<b>From noon to midnight. For the entire 12 hours.</b>

663
01:00:36,980 --> 01:00:40,720
<b>Of all days, it was when they were doing an inspection?</b>

664
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:44,390
<b>No. It was because of a sudden error.</b>

665
01:00:46,250 --> 01:00:47,760
<b>It wasn't scheduled.</b>

666
01:00:49,620 --> 01:00:53,530
<b>That's why the police can't conclude it was suicide.</b>

667
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,930
<b>Because it seems suspicious.</b>

668
01:00:58,170 --> 01:01:00,400
<b>Maybe Chairman Yeo was behind it.</b>

669
01:01:01,370 --> 01:01:02,800
<b>No way.</b>

670
01:01:03,370 --> 01:01:04,810
<b>That's a bit much, Ye Rim.</b>

671
01:01:05,210 --> 01:01:07,880
<b>Frankly, in a tiny city like this,</b>

672
01:01:08,180 --> 01:01:11,980
<b>someone with his authority can pull off a lot of things.</b>

673
01:01:12,410 --> 01:01:13,580
<b>You know that.</b>

674
01:01:14,020 --> 01:01:15,180
<b>For Chairman Yeo,</b>

675
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:18,950
<b>it would be a breeze to control the police chief and avoid warrants.</b>

676
01:01:19,690 --> 01:01:20,860
<b>Don't you agree?</b>

677
01:01:25,660 --> 01:01:27,330
<b>This is the original. There are no copies.</b>

678
01:02:31,300 --> 01:02:32,430
<b>You and I...</b>

679
01:02:34,070 --> 01:02:35,840
<b>must take this with us to our graves.</b>

680
01:02:37,870 --> 01:02:39,110
<b>What about Da Kyung?</b>

681
01:02:39,410 --> 01:02:42,640
<b>She didn't say much after asking what time Mr. Lee left the office.</b>

682
01:02:43,810 --> 01:02:45,710
<b>She can never find out.</b>

683
01:02:46,710 --> 01:02:49,420
<b>We must bury this as quietly as possible. Got that?</b>

684
01:02:51,390 --> 01:02:54,420
<b>Do you think burying it is the best for her?</b>

685
01:02:57,630 --> 01:02:58,830
<b>Sorry, sir.</b>

686
01:03:00,130 --> 01:03:04,800
<b>No, no. You're not completely wrong.</b>

687
01:03:05,370 --> 01:03:07,370
<b>Let's decide which is best...</b>

688
01:03:08,770 --> 01:03:10,770
<b>after watching this.</b>

689
01:03:11,610 --> 01:03:12,970
<b>What should we do about Ji Sun Woo?</b>

690
01:04:08,230 --> 01:04:09,330
<b>Hello?</b>

691
01:04:30,050 --> 01:04:32,490
<b>What's wrong? Do you have something on your mind?</b>

692
01:04:34,590 --> 01:04:37,090
<b>No. There's no need to concern yourself.</b>

693
01:04:40,330 --> 01:04:42,030
<b>You have so many things...</b>

694
01:04:43,430 --> 01:04:45,130
<b>that I shouldn't know.</b>

695
01:04:51,470 --> 01:04:54,510
<b>My head's spinning because of Park In Kyu.</b>

696
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:04,150
<b>Why?</b>

697
01:05:05,550 --> 01:05:07,460
<b>You said you had nothing to do with it.</b>

698
01:05:12,460 --> 01:05:13,860
<b>I may...</b>

699
01:05:16,360 --> 01:05:18,000
<b>have to bring Joon Young.</b>

700
01:05:31,710 --> 01:05:33,380
<b>You're so mean.</b>

701
01:05:35,620 --> 01:05:38,790
<b>"No. It can't be. It had better not be."</b>

702
01:05:39,690 --> 01:05:42,560
<b>Do you know what I tell myself countless times a day to hang on?</b>

703
01:05:45,030 --> 01:05:46,790
<b>But all you talk about is Joon Young?</b>

704
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:51,030
<b>- What are you talking about? - Where's your wedding ring?</b>

705
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:54,400
<b>Did you decide not to even wear it anymore?</b>

706
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:56,800
<b>What was that bloodstain on your shirt?</b>

707
01:06:00,140 --> 01:06:02,180
<b>Why were you at Gosan Station that night?</b>

708
01:06:03,340 --> 01:06:04,510
<b>Tell me.</b>

709
01:06:05,750 --> 01:06:08,550
<b>What happened at Gosan Station that night?</b>

710
01:06:46,220 --> 01:06:47,890
<b>I understand why you're being like this,</b>

711
01:06:49,220 --> 01:06:50,290
<b>but it wasn't me.</b>

712
01:06:51,030 --> 01:06:52,360
<b>I didn't do it.</b>

713
01:06:54,830 --> 01:06:56,700
<b>Yes, I was at Gosan Station at that time.</b>

714
01:06:56,860 --> 01:06:58,670
<b>But I didn't even see that punk.</b>

715
01:06:58,670 --> 01:07:01,600
<b>By the time I got there, he was already on the ground.</b>

716
01:07:03,500 --> 01:07:05,010
<b>Go and tell the police that.</b>

717
01:07:07,710 --> 01:07:08,810
<b>That will do.</b>

718
01:07:18,150 --> 01:07:19,650
<b>Ji Sun Woo was there.</b>

719
01:07:25,730 --> 01:07:26,830
<b>What do you mean?</b>

720
01:07:29,660 --> 01:07:30,830
<b>Are you saying...</b>

721
01:07:31,330 --> 01:07:32,730
<b>she killed him?</b>

722
01:07:32,730 --> 01:07:35,070
<b>I don't know for sure.</b>

723
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:38,270
<b>However, I am suspicious.</b>

724
01:07:39,570 --> 01:07:41,710
<b>Either Min Hyun Seo did it or they did it together.</b>

725
01:07:42,140 --> 01:07:45,480
<b>Then they sent me to the roof to frame me.</b>

726
01:07:48,080 --> 01:07:50,220
<b>Why don't you tell the police?</b>

727
01:07:51,320 --> 01:07:53,550
<b>She's Joon Young's mom!</b>

728
01:07:55,360 --> 01:07:58,790
<b>How could I make my son's mom a murderer?</b>

729
01:07:59,830 --> 01:08:00,960
<b>So?</b>

730
01:08:02,260 --> 01:08:04,730
<b>Will you protect someone who may have killed a person?</b>

731
01:08:04,730 --> 01:08:05,930
<b>Because she's Joon Young's mom?</b>

732
01:08:13,670 --> 01:08:16,080
<b>Let's bring Joon Young home first. Okay?</b>

733
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:19,580
<b>Please...</b>

734
01:08:19,950 --> 01:08:22,550
<b>Sorry I couldn't be honest with you because I didn't want you to worry.</b>

735
01:08:23,850 --> 01:08:26,390
<b>But it really wasn't me.</b>

736
01:08:29,160 --> 01:08:30,290
<b>Please believe me, Da Kyung.</b>

737
01:08:33,660 --> 01:08:34,860
<b>Make me...</b>

738
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:38,100
<b>believe you.</b>

739
01:09:25,180 --> 01:09:27,210
<b>Why are you following Sun Woo?</b>

740
01:09:31,420 --> 01:09:32,920
<b>What are you up to, Dr. Kim?</b>

741
01:09:33,990 --> 01:09:36,090
<b>I saw Lee Tae Oh that night.</b>

742
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:02,880
<b>I hope you won't mess with Sun Woo...</b>

743
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:05,190
<b>just to cover up your son-in-law's crime.</b>

744
01:10:05,990 --> 01:10:07,450
<b>If that's what you plan to do,</b>

745
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:11,760
<b>I'd have to tell everyone what I saw too.</b>

746
01:10:17,670 --> 01:10:19,070
<b>What is it that you want to say?</b>

747
01:10:52,330 --> 01:10:53,370
<b>Come in.</b>

748
01:12:09,110 --> 01:12:11,680
<b>Did you want to frame me as the murderer?</b>

749
01:12:16,020 --> 01:12:18,190
<b>When we look at the circumstances and the witnesses,</b>

750
01:12:18,850 --> 01:12:21,460
<b>Tae Oh is more at a disadvantage than me.</b>

751
01:12:23,460 --> 01:12:25,860
<b>Actually, my connections in Gosan...</b>

752
01:12:26,630 --> 01:12:28,330
<b>are very few.</b>

753
01:12:28,330 --> 01:12:31,530
<b>I'm not someone powerful enough to manipulate a case.</b>

754
01:12:32,230 --> 01:12:34,500
<b>- Why would I do that? - I wonder why...</b>

755
01:12:36,100 --> 01:12:37,640
<b>there is no security footage from that day.</b>

756
01:12:39,110 --> 01:12:42,040
<b>I'm not from the police. How should I know about that?</b>

757
01:12:42,440 --> 01:12:43,510
<b>Don't you agree?</b>

758
01:12:44,040 --> 01:12:45,210
<b>Then we'll just...</b>

759
01:12:46,450 --> 01:12:48,980
<b>check the station's security footage from the next day...</b>

760
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:52,520
<b>to see who took the footage.</b>

761
01:12:54,620 --> 01:12:56,120
<b>They should have a record of it.</b>

762
01:13:03,530 --> 01:13:04,800
<b>What is it that you want?</b>

763
01:13:10,540 --> 01:13:11,810
<b>Both Tae Oh and I...</b>

764
01:13:14,340 --> 01:13:16,980
<b>shouldn't become murderers.</b>

765
01:13:20,150 --> 01:13:21,250
<b>Because Park In Kyu...</b>

766
01:13:24,650 --> 01:13:25,820
<b>committed suicide.</b>

767
01:14:45,730 --> 01:14:47,270
<b>Are you Mr. Lee Tae Oh?</b>

768
01:14:52,310 --> 01:14:53,570
<b>I need you to come with us.</b>

769
01:15:13,830 --> 01:15:15,230
<b>I'm at the police station.</b>

770
01:15:18,830 --> 01:15:21,270
<b>I'm sorry I made you go to a place like that.</b>

771
01:15:23,970 --> 01:15:26,110
<b>I decided not to become a nuisance to you anymore.</b>

772
01:15:28,010 --> 01:15:29,210
<b>Starting from now,</b>

773
01:15:30,280 --> 01:15:32,250
<b>I'll take care of my own problems.</b>

774
01:16:08,980 --> 01:16:11,020
<b>(Husband)</b>

775
01:16:19,790 --> 01:16:24,060
<b>(Lee Tae Oh)</b>

776
01:16:47,290 --> 01:16:48,360
<b>Let's go.</b>

777
01:17:00,170 --> 01:17:03,270
<b>It looks like there's a problem with your plan, Dr. Ji.</b>

778
01:17:48,250 --> 01:17:50,780
<b>(A World of Married Couple)</b>

779
01:17:50,920 --> 01:17:54,790
<b>I'm sorry, but I don't care about Lee Tae Oh's future.</b>

780
01:17:54,790 --> 01:17:56,890
<b>What do I have to do to make you believe me?</b>

781
01:17:57,020 --> 01:17:59,890
<b>Do you know why I couldn't escape from In Kyu?</b>

782
01:18:00,230 --> 01:18:01,460
<b>Because I pitied him.</b>

783
01:18:01,730 --> 01:18:04,000
<b>He wasn't like that when he was with me.</b>

784
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:06,400
<b>But he somehow looked content.</b>

785
01:18:06,530 --> 01:18:09,170
<b>She's enduring everything just because of you.</b>

786
01:18:09,670 --> 01:18:10,870
<b>Because she's your mom.</b>

787
01:18:11,200 --> 01:18:13,610
<b>Both of them were struggling to hold on.</b>

788
01:18:14,270 --> 01:18:16,080
<b>You should let go of him first.</b>

789
01:18:16,310 --> 01:18:18,680
<b>Although they're full of hate for each other,</b>

790
01:18:18,680 --> 01:18:21,720
<b>I doubt she can open her heart to someone new. At least not now.</b>

791
01:18:21,950 --> 01:18:23,650
<b>What if I told you I regret getting remarried?</b>

792
01:18:23,820 --> 01:18:26,250
<b>What if I told you it's plain and I've gotten sick of it?</b>

793
01:18:27,550 --> 01:18:29,320
<b>Will you tell me the truth too?</b>
