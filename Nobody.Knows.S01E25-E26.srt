50

53
00:05:10,434 --> 00:05:11,868
<b>It's all white.</b>

54
00:05:13,608 --> 00:05:15,274
<b>It doesn't seem to have chlorophyll.</b>

55
00:05:15,298 --> 00:05:19,442
<b>So, it feeds on decaying organisms.</b>

56
00:05:19,726 --> 00:05:20,817
<b>Isn't it amazing?</b>

57
00:05:20,841 --> 00:05:25,759
<b>Mistletoes live off other organisms'

58

<b>in the hill up there

59
00:05:27,885 --> 00:05:30,062
<b>But this one cleans up...</b>

60
00:05:30,188 --> 00:05:33,056
<b>by eating dirty and stinky bodies.</b>

61
00:05:33,223 --> 00:05:36,526
<b>Mistletoes are a parasitic plant,
and this one is a saprophyte.</b>

62
00:05:36,675 --> 00:05:38,061
<b>Did you learn that from school?</b>

63
00:05:38,695 --> 00:05:41,264
<b>- I saw it from a book.
- It wouldn't say this, though.</b>

64
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:44,568
<b>Some people are like mistletoes,</b>

65
00:05:45,001 --> 00:05:46,680
<b>and others are like this one.</b>

66
00:05:46,704 --> 00:05:49,750
<b>So we should live like a saprophyte,
not a parasitic one?</b>

67
00:05:49,774 --> 00:05:51,218
<b>That's right in some sense.</b>

68
00:05:51,242 --> 00:05:53,877
<b>But people should live together
while helping each other.</b>

69
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:55,836
<b>That's called a commensal.</b>

70
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,914
<b>Now you're trying to lecture

71

<b>What's the name of it?</b>

72
00:06:01,743 --> 00:06:03,545
<b>- What?
- What is it?</b>

<b>Ghost plant,

74

<b>Young Jin, isn't it a mutant?</b>

75
00:06:13,764 --> 00:06:15,966
<b>It can't photosynthesize
due to the lack of chlorophyll.</b>

76
00:06:16,366 --> 00:06:19,536
<b>- That's why it's all white.
- Then, what does it feed on?</b>

77
00:06:20,704 --> 00:06:23,373
<b>It earns nutrition
from decaying bodies...</b>

78
00:06:23,507 --> 00:06:25,742
<b>of animals and plants,
and also from animal excretion.</b>

79
00:06:27,028 --> 00:06:28,545
<b>That's gross.</b>

80
00:06:28,745 --> 00:06:31,444
<b>What do you mean it's gross?
It's doing its best to live on.</b>

81
00:06:31,468 --> 00:06:34,151
<b>It even cleans up the dirty things.</b>

82
00:06:34,351 --> 00:06:35,652
<b>You sound like an old soul.</b>

83
00:06:36,019 --> 00:06:38,922
<b>Do you know you sometimes
talk like your grandfather?</b>

84
00:06:39,162 --> 00:06:41,458
<b>- What's wrong with it?
- Forget it.</b>

85
00:06:43,803 --> 00:06:44,928
<b>What's its name?</b>

86
00:06:47,046 --> 00:06:49,266
<b>What is it?</b>

87
00:06:51,679 --> 00:06:53,140
<b>Ghost plant,

88

00:06:54,272 --> 00:06:55,372
<b>Really?</b>

90

<b>My name is Soo Jung too.</b>

91

<b>How can you be this elegant

92
00:07:03,828 --> 00:07:05,248
<b>Like me!</b>

93
00:07:06,183 --> 00:07:07,284
<b>Let's go back.</b>

94
00:07:11,069 --> 00:07:12,189
<b>By the way,</b>

95
00:07:12,622 --> 00:07:16,059
<b>isn't a dead body buried
under the plant?</b>

96
00:07:22,843 --> 00:07:24,701
<b>That's nonsense.</b>

97
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:26,102
<b>Let's go.</b>

98
00:07:33,577 --> 00:07:36,112

<b>He stabbed the victim

<b>So that she'd bleed a lot.</b>

106
00:08:05,834 --> 00:08:09,346
<b>She must've been so scared

107
00:08:09,787 --> 00:08:11,615
<b>She also must've been
really angry...</b>

108

00:12:45,591 --> 00:12:46,756
<b>She's a good kid.</b>

157
00:12:47,148 --> 00:12:49,492
<b>Good enough to be redeemed
from the pain of life.</b>

158
00:13:01,601 --> 00:13:02,601
<b>I'll help you.</b>

159
00:13:02,886 --> 00:13:04,207
<b>Thank you.</b>

160
00:13:06,142 --> 00:13:08,378
<b>- What's your name?
- I'm Choi Soo Jung.</b>

161
00:13:08,511 --> 00:13:10,380
<b>- And yours?
- I'm Baek Sang Ho.</b>

162
00:13:11,429 --> 00:13:13,816
<b>- What about your friend?
- It's Young...</b>

163
00:13:15,671 --> 00:13:19,122
<b>She doesn't usually answer
when a stranger calls her name.</b>

164
00:13:19,787 --> 00:13:20,929
<b>You know what?</b>

165
00:13:21,307 --> 00:13:22,792
<b>I already know her name.</b>

166
00:13:24,076 --> 00:13:27,163
<b>You called her name out loud
over there.</b>

167
00:13:29,299 --> 00:13:32,001
<b>- Was it Cha Young Shin?
- It's Young Jin.</b>

168
00:13:33,369 --> 00:13:34,504
<b>Cha Young Jin.</b>

169
00:13:35,069 --> 00:13:37,273
<b>- I'll pretend not to know her name.
- Sure.</b>

170
00:14:02,232 --> 00:14:04,444
<b>- What's your name?
- I'm Choi Soo Jung.</b>

171
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:06,569
<b>- And yours?
- I'm Baek Sang Ho.</b>

172
00:14:17,513 --> 00:14:18,648
<b>I'm doing it tomorrow.</b>

173
00:14:21,651 --> 00:14:24,921
<b>I got it.
Stop worrying and just wait.</b>

174
00:14:56,292 --> 00:14:57,561
<b>(Young Jin)</b>

175
00:15:07,921 --> 00:15:09,065
<b>Fine. I'll come to you.</b>

176
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:30,030
<b>Soo Jung.</b>

177
00:15:33,202 --> 00:15:34,323
<b>I'm sorry if I startled you.</b>

178
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:38,094
<b>- Who are you?
- We met at the orphanage.</b>

179
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:40,129
<b>Can I come to you?</b>

180
00:15:41,093 --> 00:15:42,565
<b>You startled me.</b>

181
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:46,302
<b>- Where are you going?
- To Young Jin.</b>

182
00:15:46,593 --> 00:15:48,805
<b>What brings you to my neighborhood?</b>

183
00:15:49,734 --> 00:15:50,773
<b>I'm here for you.</b>

184
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:05,455
<b>Whom were you calling earlier?</b>

185
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:09,358
<b>Young Jin?</b>

186
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:12,094
<b>Should I call her again?</b>

187
00:16:24,148 --> 00:16:25,148
<b>She's not picking up.</b>

188
00:16:26,509 --> 00:16:27,827
<b>Don't be too disappointed.</b>

189
00:16:28,014 --> 00:16:29,912
<b>Your pain will end soon,</b>

190
00:16:30,181 --> 00:16:32,415
<b>but Young Jin's pain has just begun.</b>

191
00:16:33,282 --> 00:16:35,885
<b>I'm going to tell her
you died for her.</b>

192
00:16:36,366 --> 00:16:37,585
<b>And of course,</b>

193
00:16:37,854 --> 00:16:39,589
<b>I won't tell her why.</b>

194
00:16:40,056 --> 00:16:42,091
<b>That's what drives people crazy.</b>

195
00:16:48,233 --> 00:16:50,700
<b>(1 missed call)</b>

196
00:17:08,151 --> 00:17:09,385
<b>Cha Young Jin!</b>

197
00:17:12,326 --> 00:17:13,689
<b>Cha Young Jin!</b>

198
00:17:20,229 --> 00:17:21,831
<b>If I had answered the phone,</b>

199
00:17:23,421 --> 00:17:25,902
<b>Soo Jung might have still lived.</b>

200
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:30,239
<b>The assailant must have
her phone, right?</b>

201
00:17:30,263 --> 00:17:32,108
<b>I'm sure he threw it
into the sea or something.</b>

202
00:17:32,442 --> 00:17:33,976
<b>Or he must've broken it into pieces.</b>

203
00:17:34,468 --> 00:17:36,279
<b>Then, why would he have taken it
with him?</b>

204
00:17:37,036 --> 00:17:38,350
<b>- What?
- I heard...</b>

205
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:40,295
<b>that it's the first time
that the murderer had...</b>

206
00:17:40,516 --> 00:17:42,151
<b>taken his victims' belonging.</b>

207
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:46,007
<b>I'm sure he has it with him.</b>

208
00:18:01,003 --> 00:18:03,005
<b>(Soo Jung)</b>

209
00:18:09,202 --> 00:18:10,413
<b>Young Jin?</b>

210
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:13,210
<b>It's you, right?</b>

211
00:18:14,202 --> 00:18:15,055
<b>This is her.</b>

212
00:18:15,079 --> 00:18:16,795
<b>Finally, you picked up the phone.</b>

213
00:18:16,819 --> 00:18:19,555
<b>- If I had answered her call...
- She would've been alive by now.</b>

214
00:18:20,823 --> 00:18:22,702
<b>I was going to kill you,</b>

215
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:24,406
<b>but you didn't meet
the requirements I set.</b>

216
00:18:25,585 --> 00:18:26,796
<b>So I killed her instead.</b>

217
00:18:29,444 --> 00:18:31,140
<b>I'll kill you.</b>

218
00:18:31,467 --> 00:18:32,735
<b>Are you not scared of me?</b>

219
00:18:33,569 --> 00:18:35,371
<b>I might go find you.</b>

220
00:18:35,638 --> 00:18:37,473
<b>I'll go find you.</b>

221
00:18:37,647 --> 00:18:39,542
<b>Then, I should tell you this.</b>

222
00:18:39,842 --> 00:18:42,545
<b>The stigmata murder will not
happen anymore.</b>

223
00:18:42,652 --> 00:18:44,380
<b>Soo Jung was the last one.</b>

224
00:18:44,905 --> 00:18:47,416
<b>So you can't find me.</b>

225
00:18:49,687 --> 00:18:50,987
<b>I will.</b>

226
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:54,857
<b>No matter how long it takes,</b>

227
00:18:55,866 --> 00:18:57,627
<b>I'll find you at any cost.</b>

228
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,864
<b>So you must stay alive until then.</b>

229
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:04,634
<b>I kind of like you.</b>

230
00:19:04,959 --> 00:19:06,402
<b>I can't wait to meet you.</b>

231
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,938
<b>I really hope we meet someday.</b>

232
00:19:58,735 --> 00:20:01,608
<b>- Pick anything you like.
- I think it may take a while.</b>

233
00:20:01,632 --> 00:20:03,459
<b>Take your time.</b>

234
00:20:05,812 --> 00:20:07,292
<b>Do you want me to take it out
for you?</b>

235
00:20:08,431 --> 00:20:09,431
<b>Yes.</b>

236
00:20:26,857 --> 00:20:28,751
<b>It wasn't in the room of your place.</b>

237
00:20:31,187 --> 00:20:32,347
<b>The tenth floor of the hotel.</b>

238
00:20:35,334 --> 00:20:36,859
<b>I saw it in the study there.</b>

239
00:20:39,882 --> 00:20:41,142
<b>I thought...</b>

240
00:20:43,116 --> 00:20:45,201
<b>he'd kill me if he'd found out
that I saw it.</b>

241
00:20:53,876 --> 00:20:54,876
<b>Here.</b>

242
00:20:57,702 --> 00:20:59,115
<b>Why? Do you not like it?</b>

243
00:20:59,282 --> 00:21:01,517
<b>It's too heavy.</b>

244
00:21:01,851 --> 00:21:03,419
<b>It's only for display.</b>

245
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:04,920
<b>Hold on.</b>

246
00:21:08,999 --> 00:21:10,538
<b>This is a book I want to recommend.</b>

247
00:21:11,527 --> 00:21:14,096
<b>What do you think? Have you read it?</b>

248
00:21:17,218 --> 00:21:20,002
<b>- I bought this today.
- Did you buy one again already?</b>

249
00:21:21,003 --> 00:21:23,639
<b>He asked me
if I'd bought one again already.</b>

250
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:27,343
<b>He knew I lost the book.</b>

251
00:21:28,591 --> 00:21:30,679
<b>I need to go now.</b>

252
00:21:31,233 --> 00:21:32,393
<b>Aren't you going to pick one?</b>

253
00:21:33,562 --> 00:21:34,617
<b>I'm a little tired.</b>

254
00:21:36,678 --> 00:21:41,090
<b>Can I come and pick one next time?
I'll make sure to pick one then.</b>

255
00:21:42,288 --> 00:21:43,826
<b>Of course, you can.</b>

256
00:21:45,132 --> 00:21:46,262
<b>Come back anytime.</b>

257
00:21:54,366 --> 00:21:56,572
<b>The one who snatched your backpack.</b>

258
00:21:58,069 --> 00:22:00,109
<b>The one who put it back.</b>

259
00:22:01,155 --> 00:22:02,311
<b>It was all Baek Sang Ho.</b>

260
00:22:06,048 --> 00:22:08,117
<b>Why is this here?</b>

261
00:22:09,759 --> 00:22:11,831
<b>I met a demon.</b>

262
00:22:11,855 --> 00:22:14,323
<b>- What does that mean?
- Surviving...</b>

263
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:16,769
<b>put me in hell.</b>

264
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:19,226
<b>Are you looking for those
who committed...</b>

265
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:20,239
<b>a shameful sin at my hotel?</b>

266
00:22:20,263 --> 00:22:22,298
<b>You mean the drug dealers?</b>

267
00:22:22,645 --> 00:22:25,034
<b>If you can find either one of them,</b>

268
00:22:25,459 --> 00:22:27,503
<b>which one will you choose?</b>

269
00:22:27,729 --> 00:22:29,382
<b>This happened
because the buyer was mistaken...</b>

270
00:22:29,406 --> 00:22:32,308
<b>the seller sneaked the money away
when it was actually Eun Ho.</b>

271
00:22:33,812 --> 00:22:36,979
<b>Then the two of them
disappeared into thin air.</b>

272
00:22:37,279 --> 00:22:40,983
<b>Aren't you curious
about what happened between them?</b>

273
00:22:45,168 --> 00:22:46,389
<b>Ms. Cha.</b>

274
00:22:53,751 --> 00:22:55,386
<b>Can you continue?</b>

275
00:22:56,398 --> 00:22:57,566
<b>I want to.</b>

276
00:22:59,668 --> 00:23:00,736
<b>Why...</b>

277
00:23:02,872 --> 00:23:05,674
<b>did you run away upstairs,
not downstairs?</b>

278
00:23:13,937 --> 00:23:15,050
<b>On the tenth floor,</b>

279
00:23:16,202 --> 00:23:18,002
<b>nothing will open up
without our fingerprints.</b>

280
00:23:18,854 --> 00:23:19,955
<b>I'll take you home.</b>

281
00:23:23,905 --> 00:23:25,828
<b>I just want to take a walk.</b>

282
00:23:28,257 --> 00:23:29,257
<b>All right, then.</b>

283
00:23:34,569 --> 00:23:35,671
<b>Go home safely.</b>

284
00:23:36,779 --> 00:23:37,840
<b>Thank you.</b>

285
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,230
<b>That man noticed right away...</b>

286
00:24:01,564 --> 00:24:03,303
<b>that I was running away.</b>

287
00:24:03,327 --> 00:24:05,211
<b>- Are you going home?
- Yes.</b>

288
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:07,036
<b>Did he just let you go?</b>

289
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,371
<b>- What?
- Didn't he say he'd drive you home?</b>

290
00:24:10,004 --> 00:24:14,143
<b>He did, but I just wanted to go
by myself.</b>

291
00:24:53,488 --> 00:24:55,017
<b>I didn't want to die.</b>

292
00:25:23,412 --> 00:25:25,335
<b>I was scared to death.</b>

293
00:25:26,741 --> 00:25:28,417
<b>I couldn't move an inch.</b>

294
00:25:31,193 --> 00:25:32,521
<b>Hey!</b>

295
00:25:32,874 --> 00:25:33,874
<b>Hey!</b>

296
00:25:39,687 --> 00:25:41,397
<b>The moment they showed up,</b>

297
00:25:43,562 --> 00:25:44,800
<b>I jumped off.</b>

298
00:25:50,372 --> 00:25:51,372
<b>Why...</b>

299
00:25:52,875 --> 00:25:54,843
<b>did you fall from the middle?</b>

300
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:10,803
<b>When I was dragged back up,</b>

301
00:26:10,827 --> 00:26:12,795
<b>I was so frightened...</b>

302
00:26:17,755 --> 00:26:19,401
<b>that no one might know...</b>

303
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:23,272
<b>what happened to me.</b>

304
00:26:37,165 --> 00:26:38,611
<b>Baek Sang Ho...</b>

305
00:26:39,968 --> 00:26:41,199
<b>It'd be a miracle...</b>

306
00:26:41,223 --> 00:26:44,203
<b>if someone survives after falling
from this height.</b>

307
00:26:44,293 --> 00:26:48,063
<b>But that miracle
happened here yesterday.</b>

308
00:26:49,264 --> 00:26:52,000
<b>Good luck on finding the culprit.</b>

309
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:54,269
<b>Do you think...</b>

310
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:57,573
<b>- it's a criminal case?
- I hope so.</b>

311
00:26:57,906 --> 00:27:01,643
<b>That may be less painful

<b>I can't and I don't want to.</b>

472

<b>He can be forgiven

487

<b>However, for your faults,</b>

<b>Tell me so that I can understand.</b>

503

<b>while absorbing nutrients.</b>

<b>Why?</b>

<b>Min Sung.</b>

508
00:40:20,430 --> 00:40:22,248
<b>What does parasitism mean?</b>

509
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:26,328
<b>It's when an organism lives on
another one by absorbing nutrients.</b>

510
00:40:26,352 --> 00:40:27,515
<b>Like a parasite?</b>

511
00:40:28,538 --> 00:40:31,200
<b>It makes me want to study

<b>So you can help others

514

<b>I told you not to even talk

<b>Yes, it's Ko Eun Ho in Class 2-2.</b>

<b>- Yes.
- Was it Baek Sang Ho?</b>

542
00:43:01,632 --> 00:43:02,632
<b>Yes.</b>

543

<b>Then the cases of Kevin Jung,

<b>the stigmata serial murder case too.</b>

547
00:43:15,695 --> 00:43:17,476
<b>What's the correlation there?</b>

548
00:43:20,647 --> 00:43:22,605
<b>Eun Ho went to Sang Ho's study...</b>

549

<b>Not a picture of her phone,</b>

552
00:43:32,343 --> 00:43:33,343
<b>Yes.</b>

553
00:43:34,804 --> 00:43:36,847

00:48:38,505 --> 00:48:40,176
<b>No, I called you first.</b>

622
00:48:41,343 --> 00:48:44,548
<b>What if the kid regained his memory?</b>

623
00:48:45,439 --> 00:48:47,870
<b>I can't predict
what Sang Ho would do...</b>

624
00:48:48,367 --> 00:48:49,507
<b>if he finds out.</b>

625
00:48:49,921 --> 00:48:51,665
<b>I get what you're saying.</b>

626
00:48:51,689 --> 00:48:53,754
<b>I'll look into it and call you back.</b>

627
00:49:03,046 --> 00:49:04,046
<b>Hello.</b>

628
00:49:14,257 --> 00:49:15,837
<b>I'll leave you two alone.</b>

629
00:49:16,703 --> 00:49:17,710
<b>Goodbye.</b>

630
00:49:52,140 --> 00:49:53,177
<b>Let's try again.</b>

631
00:49:53,273 --> 00:49:55,741
<b>Well done. You're almost there.</b>

632
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:11,013
<b>I'm on my way to school.</b>

633
00:50:11,038 --> 00:50:14,311
<b>Did you tell Eun Ho's mom
that he regained all his memory?</b>

634
00:50:14,335 --> 00:50:17,598
<b>I just left as soon as she came.</b>

635
00:50:17,622 --> 00:50:19,951
<b>Oh, right. How did the result
come out, Ms. Cha?</b>

636
00:50:20,492 --> 00:50:21,889
<b>I'm still waiting.</b>

637
00:50:21,913 --> 00:50:23,684
<b>Call me when the result is out.</b>

638
00:50:23,708 --> 00:50:25,786
<b>I'll wait for you with the book
as we promised.</b>

639
00:50:36,812 --> 00:50:40,663
<b>We will take care of Eun Ho
from now on.</b>

640
00:50:41,617 --> 00:50:42,617
<b>What?</b>

641
00:50:45,671 --> 00:50:46,733
<b>Isn't it too late now?</b>

642
00:50:46,757 --> 00:50:49,939
<b>We will return
all the money you spent...</b>

643
00:50:49,963 --> 00:50:51,170
<b>on his surgery and hospital fees.</b>

644
00:50:51,194 --> 00:50:53,294
<b>Is his guardian aware of this?</b>

645
00:50:53,318 --> 00:50:54,334
<b>I will let her know.</b>

646
00:50:55,937 --> 00:50:59,233
<b>It's not much,
so I don't need it back. Oh, right.</b>

647
00:50:59,546 --> 00:51:00,975
<b>What are you going to do...</b>

648
00:51:00,999 --> 00:51:03,391
<b>with my 15 million dollars
which Lim Hee Jung borrowed?</b>

649
00:51:03,718 --> 00:51:05,998
<b>I'm going to find Mr. Jang Ki Ho.</b>

650
00:51:06,781 --> 00:51:09,288
<b>What are you going to do
by finding him?</b>

651
00:51:09,312 --> 00:51:11,018
<b>Do you really not know?</b>

652
00:51:11,062 --> 00:51:12,815
<b>I don't understand.</b>

653
00:51:13,015 --> 00:51:14,702
<b>I'd be willing to tell you
if you did.</b>

654
00:51:14,890 --> 00:51:17,688
<b>But since you don't,
I can't tell you.</b>

655
00:51:17,712 --> 00:51:19,988
<b>It's about privacy, you know.</b>

656
00:51:21,515 --> 00:51:23,522
<b>By the way,</b>

657
00:51:25,413 --> 00:51:26,863
<b>Why are you...</b>

658
00:51:27,265 --> 00:51:29,988
<b>looking for Mr. Jang?</b>

659
00:51:31,508 --> 00:51:32,508
<b>What?</b>

660
00:51:46,046 --> 00:51:49,335
<b>We will give you a chance
to speak one last time.</b>

661
00:51:49,359 --> 00:51:50,905
<b>You're up first, Ms. Cha.</b>

662
00:51:50,929 --> 00:51:52,212
<b>Sir.</b>

663
00:51:52,236 --> 00:51:54,312
<b>Will you let me speak first?</b>

664
00:51:54,336 --> 00:51:55,336
<b>Sure.</b>

665
00:51:56,507 --> 00:51:57,882
<b>Nineteen years ago,</b>

666
00:51:57,906 --> 00:52:00,877
<b>the culprit
of the stigmata murder case...</b>

667
00:52:00,901 --> 00:52:03,557
<b>used the eighth victim's phone
and called her friend.</b>

668
00:52:03,581 --> 00:52:06,401
<b>I happened to be with her
at that time,</b>

669
00:52:06,425 --> 00:52:07,756
<b>so I took the call on her behalf.</b>

670
00:52:07,780 --> 00:52:11,013
<b>The whole country
paid attention to it.</b>

671
00:52:11,037 --> 00:52:13,261
<b>Being in the spotlight,</b>

672
00:52:13,765 --> 00:52:16,649
<b>I came to see my lowest.</b>

673
00:52:16,796 --> 00:52:19,289
<b>It was a sense of duty that I wanted
to catch the culprit at first.</b>

674
00:52:19,313 --> 00:52:22,369
<b>But it eventually degenerated
into my ambition.</b>

675
00:52:22,393 --> 00:52:24,522
<b>Obsessed with that ambition,</b>

676
00:52:24,546 --> 00:52:26,155
<b>I was feeling so anxious.</b>

677
00:52:26,179 --> 00:52:29,123
<b>That's when Cha Young Jin showed up
as a new assistant inspector.</b>

678
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:30,840
<b>I shared...</b>

679
00:52:30,864 --> 00:52:33,558
<b>all the investigation records
with her...</b>

680
00:52:33,582 --> 00:52:35,754
<b>and made her join
the investigation team.</b>

681
00:52:35,778 --> 00:52:38,488
<b>I advised her
not to tell her colleagues...</b>

682
00:52:39,077 --> 00:52:42,989
<b>about her being the victim's friend
because it was needless.</b>

683
00:52:43,013 --> 00:52:44,386
<b>I don't understand.</b>

684
00:52:44,410 --> 00:52:46,993
<b>She was a mere rookie assistant
inspector back then.</b>

685
00:52:47,017 --> 00:52:49,898
<b>And she was the victim's friend,
which was certainly her weakness.</b>

686
00:52:49,922 --> 00:52:52,407
<b>Why did you have her
in the investigation...</b>

687
00:52:52,431 --> 00:52:53,530
<b>despite
all those adverse conditions?</b>

688
00:52:53,554 --> 00:52:56,546
<b>I thought it was her strength,
not weakness.</b>

689
00:52:56,788 --> 00:52:59,276
<b>Cha Young Jin lost her only friend.</b>

690
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:00,836
<b>I thought her rage and sorrow...</b>

691
00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:03,681
<b>would fill what was lacking
in our investigation.</b>

692
00:53:04,015 --> 00:53:06,226
<b>And that her desire
to catch the culprit...</b>

693
00:53:06,250 --> 00:53:09,662
<b>would be a strong motive
to keep the investigation going.</b>

694
00:53:09,945 --> 00:53:12,905
<b>But I had no idea
it'd take this long.</b>

695
00:53:12,929 --> 00:53:14,763
<b>As years passed by,</b>

696
00:53:14,787 --> 00:53:18,412
<b>I eventually became less passionate
about the case.</b>

697
00:53:18,436 --> 00:53:20,657
<b>I was exhausted too.</b>

698
00:53:21,359 --> 00:53:22,967
<b>So I gave up in the end.</b>

699
00:53:22,991 --> 00:53:25,803
<b>But she didn't stop.</b>

700
00:53:25,827 --> 00:53:29,901
<b>If someone has to be responsible
for this, it has to be me.</b>

701
00:53:30,445 --> 00:53:33,637
<b>It was me who lied and gave up.</b>

702
00:53:35,015 --> 00:53:38,388
<b>Cha Young Jin was only used by me...</b>

703
00:53:38,412 --> 00:53:41,301
<b>who'd been blinded by ambition.</b>

704
00:53:42,578 --> 00:53:43,726
<b>That's all.</b>

705
00:53:45,968 --> 00:53:49,171
<b>Let me tell you the result.</b>

706
00:53:49,343 --> 00:53:53,209
<b>Senior Inspector Cha Young Jin will
have her pay reduced for a month.</b>

707
00:53:54,015 --> 00:53:55,685
<b>Superintendent Hwang In Beom...</b>

708
00:53:56,171 --> 00:53:57,836
<b>will be dismissed.</b>

709
00:54:21,468 --> 00:54:22,987
<b>How did it go?</b>

710
00:54:23,351 --> 00:54:24,469
<b>I got a pay-cut.</b>

711
00:54:25,531 --> 00:54:26,531
<b>That's good to hear.</b>

712
00:54:27,828 --> 00:54:30,027
<b>Are you going
to meet Jang Ki Ho now?</b>

713
00:54:30,051 --> 00:54:31,682
<b>I need to go see
my colleagues first.</b>

714
00:54:31,706 --> 00:54:34,842
<b>Then I'll be waiting with the book
at the rendezvous.</b>

715
00:54:34,866 --> 00:54:36,616
<b>- Come safely.
- Okay.</b>

716
00:55:21,453 --> 00:55:22,870
<b>Suspended for a month.</b>

717
00:55:24,999 --> 00:55:26,593
<b>What about Mr. Hwang?</b>

718
00:55:27,007 --> 00:55:28,007
<b>Dismissed.</b>

719
00:55:42,484 --> 00:55:45,087
<b>I'm truly sorry
about what happened to Mr. Hwang.</b>

720
00:55:46,296 --> 00:55:48,513
<b>- Yes.
- Don't worry about us,</b>

721
00:55:48,537 --> 00:55:50,401
<b>and go rest at somewhere nice.</b>

722
00:55:51,085 --> 00:55:52,997
<b>You've never gotten
to take a proper break.</b>

723
00:55:53,021 --> 00:55:55,638
<b>Young Jin,
are you going to give up like this?</b>

724
00:55:55,662 --> 00:55:57,231
<b>Make an appeal.</b>

725
00:55:58,304 --> 00:56:01,008
<b>Ms. Cha, don't think
about backing out.</b>

726
00:56:01,032 --> 00:56:03,475
<b>You're suspended,
but you're still a detective.</b>

727
00:56:03,499 --> 00:56:04,097
<b>He's right.</b>

728
00:56:04,121 --> 00:56:06,319
<b>It'll be unfair if we work
our butt off when she doesn't.</b>

729
00:56:06,343 --> 00:56:08,574
<b>Enough is enough!</b>

730
00:56:08,976 --> 00:56:11,269
<b>Don't do anything.
We'll take care of things here.</b>

731
00:56:11,293 --> 00:56:13,876
<b>I volunteered to join this team
because of her.</b>

732
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:16,984
<b>Right. Mr. Han, I want
Ms. Yoon back in my team.</b>

733
00:56:17,008 --> 00:56:18,856
<b>Don't be so emotional.</b>

734
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:22,046
<b>This isn't for my sake.
It's all for you.</b>

735
00:56:25,437 --> 00:56:26,856
<b>You know what?</b>

736
00:56:28,101 --> 00:56:30,014
<b>I'll keep investigating
even without you.</b>

737
00:56:30,273 --> 00:56:34,219
<b>Even if our team gets disbanded
and the case is closed,</b>

738
00:56:37,117 --> 00:56:38,270
<b>I'll keep doing it.</b>

739
00:56:40,476 --> 00:56:43,287
<b>Thank you all.</b>

740
00:56:44,249 --> 00:56:46,042
<b>- But...
- But what?</b>

741
00:56:46,067 --> 00:56:47,987
<b>Your thank-you is good enough.</b>

742
00:56:48,011 --> 00:56:49,272
<b>No.</b>

743
00:56:49,804 --> 00:56:51,967
<b>I'm not suspended.</b>

744
00:56:53,343 --> 00:56:55,073
<b>I'm getting a pay-cut.</b>

745
00:56:55,507 --> 00:56:56,507
<b>Pay-cut?</b>

746
00:56:57,742 --> 00:56:58,742
<b>What...</b>

747
00:56:59,242 --> 00:57:02,011
<b>I'm sure I heard it as suspension.</b>

748
00:57:02,984 --> 00:57:05,034
<b>Gosh, no wonder
why I heard it wrong.</b>

749
00:57:06,312 --> 00:57:08,717
<b>It's even better to know you aren't
suspended after thinking you were.</b>

750
00:57:08,741 --> 00:57:12,203
<b>- Good work.
- I told you she'd get a pay-cut.</b>

751
00:57:12,227 --> 00:57:15,340
<b>No matter how busy you are,
you should pick your ears and nose.</b>

752
00:57:15,364 --> 00:57:17,204
<b>Detectives have got
to be good at smelling too.</b>

753
00:57:17,632 --> 00:57:18,564
<b>Pick everything.</b>

754
00:57:18,588 --> 00:57:21,255
<b>Do it now. Go on.</b>

755
00:57:23,242 --> 00:57:26,697
<b>I've found Jang Ki Ho and the thing
he and Baek Sang Ho are looking for.</b>

756
00:57:37,879 --> 00:57:38,879
<b>Eun Ho.</b>

757
00:57:41,043 --> 00:57:42,043
<b>Ko Eun Ho.</b>

758
00:57:44,734 --> 00:57:45,734
<b>Eun Ho.</b>

759
00:57:46,913 --> 00:57:47,913
<b>Let's go.</b>

760
00:57:48,093 --> 00:57:49,899
<b>You've gone through so much today.</b>

761
00:58:00,663 --> 00:58:02,184
<b>Eun Ho seems strange.</b>

762
00:58:02,703 --> 00:58:05,769
<b>When someone calls your name,
you usually react right away.</b>

763
00:58:06,945 --> 00:58:10,870
<b>But he didn't turn around
when I called him twice.</b>

764
00:58:10,894 --> 00:58:12,789
<b>I think his memory came back.</b>

765
00:58:13,328 --> 00:58:15,131
<b>It's too dangerous to leave him be.</b>

766
00:58:17,421 --> 00:58:19,459
<b>We better find our way out...</b>

767
00:58:20,593 --> 00:58:22,139
<b>before Baek Sang Ho finds out.</b>

768
00:58:48,531 --> 00:58:51,538
<b>What's the market price
on this graph?</b>

769
00:58:51,562 --> 00:58:53,536
<b>- It's 1 dollar and 50 cents.
- Then...</b>

770
00:58:55,409 --> 00:58:57,301
<b>Were you going
to deal with it alone again?</b>

771
00:58:57,325 --> 00:58:59,778
<b>Yes, I was going to,</b>

772
00:58:59,802 --> 00:59:01,925

the same mistake.</b>

773
00:59:02,523 --> 00:59:05,432
<b>I have found the prime suspect...</b>

774
00:59:06,570 --> 00:59:08,890
<b>of the eighth stigmata murder case's
accomplice or copycat.</b>

775
00:59:12,582 --> 00:59:14,570
<b>It's the owner
of the Millennium Hotel.</b>

776
00:59:18,156 --> 00:59:19,337
<b>Baek Sang Ho.</b>

<b>(Senior Inspector Cha Young Jin)</b>

<b>Baek Sang Ho is connected

780
00:59:43,851 --> 00:59:46,830
<b>Seo Sang Won, Lim Hee Jung,
Jang Ki Ho, and Ko Eun Ho.</b>

781
00:59:46,854 --> 00:59:49,560
<b>Can we catch Baek Sang Ho
if we hand the book to Jang Ki Ho?</b>

782
00:59:49,584 --> 00:59:52,012
<b>I must give this to Ms. Cha
right now.</b>

783
00:59:52,036 --> 00:59:55,110
<b>Whom do you think I'll believe

784
00:59:55,134 --> 00:59:56,264
<b>Hi, Eun Ho.</b>

785
00:59:56,288 --> 00:59:57,732
<b>What are you doing with the kid?</b>

786
00:59:57,756 --> 01:00:00,087
<b>What are you doing here,

<b>What about my book?</b>

789
01:00:02,968 --> 01:00:05,320
<b>Don't tell me Baek Sang Ho has it.</b>

790
01:00:05,344 --> 01:00:06,736
<b>Everything will be over

<b>Only if I had Ki Ho!</b>

792
01:00:08,632 --> 01:00:11,414
<b>Even if people read this book

793

<b>it will be no use to them.</b>
