00:50:43,429 --> 00:50:44,828
<b>Yes, she's seven.</b>

631
00:50:45,268 --> 00:50:47,839
<b>She just went to the store. She'll be back soon.</b>

632
00:50:48,038 --> 00:50:49,509
<b>Did she go with Se Ri?</b>

633
00:50:50,638 --> 00:50:52,168
<b>Se Ri went to Jun Seo's place.</b>

634
00:50:52,409 --> 00:50:53,679
<b>Didn't Young Min go?</b>

635
00:50:53,708 --> 00:50:56,109
<b>- Jun Seo's place? - Yes, Jun Seo is having...</b>

636
00:50:56,109 --> 00:50:58,049
<b>a party at a hotel and invited all...</b>

637
00:50:58,949 --> 00:51:02,078
<b>Gosh, I guess he forgot.</b>

638
00:51:03,018 --> 00:51:05,288
<b>I don't think Jun Seo invited Young Min.</b>

639
00:51:05,788 --> 00:51:07,089
<b>They're not close.</b>

640
00:51:08,089 --> 00:51:09,159
<b>Is that so?</b>

641
00:51:13,958 --> 00:51:15,828
<b>(Young Min, what are you up to? Did you have lunch?)</b>

642
00:51:18,498 --> 00:51:20,868
<b>(Tell Dad to buy you a lot of good food.)</b>

643
00:51:21,868 --> 00:51:22,969
<b>Young Min.</b>

644
00:51:27,609 --> 00:51:28,978
<b>Should we transfer schools?</b>

645
00:51:30,609 --> 00:51:33,549
<b>Tell me the truth. What happened?</b>

646
00:51:34,848 --> 00:51:36,518
<b>Nothing.</b>

647
00:51:36,518 --> 00:51:38,149
<b>Then why did you write this?</b>

648
00:51:39,659 --> 00:51:42,888
<b>I was just tired of studying.</b>

649
00:51:43,089 --> 00:51:44,728
<b>And that made you think of dying?</b>

650
00:51:47,929 --> 00:51:49,199
<b>It's school violence, isn't it?</b>

651
00:51:49,929 --> 00:51:51,069
<b>No, it's not.</b>

652
00:51:51,069 --> 00:51:52,868
<b>I can go and ask the school.</b>

653
00:51:54,998 --> 00:51:56,009
<b>I am...</b>

654
00:51:56,768 --> 00:51:58,368
<b>an impatient person.</b>

655
00:52:02,638 --> 00:52:04,248
<b>I was the offender.</b>

656
00:52:06,449 --> 00:52:07,949
<b>I'm so sorry.</b>

657
00:52:24,228 --> 00:52:25,969
<b>- Sir. - Yes?</b>

658
00:52:26,368 --> 00:52:29,138
<b>- Where will you play the guitar? - I'm not telling you.</b>

659
00:52:30,509 --> 00:52:31,668
<b>I want to see you play.</b>

660
00:52:32,368 --> 00:52:35,339
<b>There's nothing to see. It's been more than 20 years.</b>

661
00:52:36,049 --> 00:52:38,348
<b>But still, your body will remember it.</b>

662
00:52:38,808 --> 00:52:39,879
<b>Well...</b>

663
00:52:41,179 --> 00:52:43,248
<b>It remembers too clearly.</b>

664
00:52:46,558 --> 00:52:47,719
<b>What's that guitar for?</b>

665
00:52:48,659 --> 00:52:50,029
<b>I thought I'd start playing again.</b>

666
00:52:53,228 --> 00:52:56,969
<b>Gosh, then you should've asked me.</b>

667
00:52:57,069 --> 00:52:59,668
<b>I used to be great at playing the guitar.</b>

668
00:53:02,839 --> 00:53:06,038
<b>Ask Yoon Ji Su if you don't believe me.</b>

669
00:53:06,038 --> 00:53:08,279
<b>I always played it for her in our club room.</b>

670
00:53:10,248 --> 00:53:12,918
<b>You did. 1 song during the whole 4 years.</b>

671
00:53:13,219 --> 00:53:15,549
<b>At least I mastered that one song.</b>

672
00:53:15,949 --> 00:53:17,418
<b>With these delicate fingers too.</b>

673
00:53:18,489 --> 00:53:21,058
<b>I do feel bad for Yang Hee Eun.</b>

674
00:53:21,418 --> 00:53:24,558
<b>I'm going to apologize to her if I ever get to meet her.</b>

675
00:53:24,558 --> 00:53:26,699
<b>So you do have a conscience?</b>

676
00:53:30,168 --> 00:53:34,339
<b>Anyway, so you want to try playing?</b>

677
00:53:34,668 --> 00:53:37,208
<b>Do you think you can do that here?</b>

678
00:53:38,268 --> 00:53:40,179
<b>- Hey, Dong Jin. - Yes?</b>

679
00:53:41,109 --> 00:53:42,308
<b>Can I do something...</b>

680
00:53:43,449 --> 00:53:44,679
<b>cowardly just for today?</b>

681
00:53:46,518 --> 00:53:47,578
<b>What?</b>

682
00:54:35,498 --> 00:54:38,429
<b>I'm at your place. I have something to tell you.</b>

<b>(Lee Se Hun)</b>

684
00:55:33,159 --> 00:55:35,788
<b>Young Min, what are you up to?</b>

685
00:55:36,328 --> 00:55:37,759
<b>Did you have lunch?</b>

686
00:55:38,429 --> 00:55:40,799
<b>Tell Dad to buy you a lot of good food.</b>

<b>Mom.</b>

688
00:55:44,969 --> 00:55:48,339
<b>Dad found out about school.</b>

689
00:55:55,909 --> 00:55:57,308
<b>What is it?</b>

690
00:55:57,978 --> 00:55:59,879
<b>I have something to give you.</b>

691
00:56:02,478 --> 00:56:03,788
<b>What's that guitar for?</b>

692
00:56:05,319 --> 00:56:06,989
<b>I just remembered that...</b>

693
00:56:06,989 --> 00:56:09,058
<b>I had promised to get you one.</b>

694
00:56:10,589 --> 00:56:11,788
<b>You know that...</b>

695
00:56:12,998 --> 00:56:14,299
<b>I'm not going to take it.</b>

696
00:56:14,899 --> 00:56:18,668
<b>I do. I know that very well,</b>

697
00:56:19,498 --> 00:56:21,239
<b>but this was a promise made long ago,</b>

698
00:56:21,239 --> 00:56:23,438
<b>so I thought you would take it.</b>

699
00:56:24,909 --> 00:56:26,239
<b>And more than that, actually...</b>

700
00:56:29,578 --> 00:56:30,748
<b>It's because I missed you.</b>

701
00:56:53,799 --> 00:56:56,168
<b>My son is friends with Young Min. They are in the same class.</b>

702
00:56:56,509 --> 00:56:59,469
<b>Since you're here, I'll get going.</b>

<b>I wasn't able to protect the most important thing.</b>

710
